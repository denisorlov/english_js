        "en": "4th February 1892.\n\nLast night I saw an extraordinary thing. There is a scientist called Nikola Tesla visiting London, and the extravagant claims he makes were last week the talk of the town.\n\nSo, yesterday I and several hundred others gathered at the doors of the Institution of Electrical Engineers to see the great man in action.\n\nWhat I witnessed was a thrilling, alarming and mostly incomprehensible display of the powers of electricity. Mr Tesla is an associate of the inventor Thomas Edison. To modern-minded Londoners the use of electrical power for lighting is becoming a commonplace, but Tesla was able to show that it has many other uses.\n\nI watched his sensational experiments uncritically, dazzled and impressed. Many of his effects are astonishing, and many more are deeply mysterious. When Tesla spoke, it was in the tones of an evangelist. He is indeed a prophet of what the next century will hold for us. A worldwide net of electrical generating stations, power given over to the humble as well as the mighty, instantaneous transmission of energies and matter from one part of the world to the other!\n\nHis show bore an odd resemblance to any good illusionist's; the audience did not need to understand the means to enjoy the effects. In short, Mr Tesla described many scientific theories. While few in that audience understood more than the most basic concepts, every one of us was afforded a fascinating glimpse into the future.\n\nI have written off to the address Tesla supplied, and requested copies of his explanatory notes.\n\n14th April 1892.\n\nI have been busy preparing for my European Tour, which starts in the latter half of this summer, and have had little time for anything else. To complete the above entry from February, though, I eventually received Mr Tesla's explanatory notes, but could not make head nor tail of them.\n\n15th September 1892.\n\nIn Paris.\n\nThey have hailed me in Vienna, Rome, Paris, Istanbul, Marseilles, Madrid, Monte Carlo... yet now that all this is behind me I crave only to see my beloved Julia once more, and Edward and Lydia, and of course my little Florence.\n\nIt would be unwise to record the extent of my earnings until all expenses have been calculated, and the agreed bonuses paid to my assistants, but I may safely say that for the first time in my life I feel I am a wealthy man.\n\n21st September 1892.\n\nIn London.\n\nWhen I was looking through correspondence, I saw a short note from Dominic Brawton, one of my scouts:\n\nPerformer: Alfred Borden (Le Professeur de la Magie).\n\nIllusion: The New Transported Man.\n\nEffect: brilliant, not to be missed.\n\nAdaptability: difficult, but as Borden manages it somehow, so I imagine could you.\n\nI showed this to Julia.\n\nLater I showed her another letter. I have been invited to take my magic show to the New World! If I agree, we would begin touring in February with a weeklong residency in Chicago! And then a tour to the dozen or so largest American cities!\n\nThe thought of it simultaneously thrills and exhausts me.\n\nJulia said to me, \"Forget Borden. You must take your show to the USA\".\n\nAnd I too think I must.\n\n14th October 1892.\n\nI have seen Borden's new illusion, and it is good. It is devilishly good.\n\nHe begins by wheeling on to the stage a wooden cabinet, of the sort familiar to all magicians. This is tall enough to contain a man or a woman, has three solid walls, and a door at the front that opens wide enough to reveal the whole of the interior. It is mounted on castors, and these raise the entire thing high enough to show that no escape or entry would be possible through the base, without being noticed by the audience.\n\nBorden closes the cabinet door, then moves the apparatus up to stage left.\n\nStanding at the footlights he then delivers, in his wonderfully unconvincing French accent, a short lecture on the great dangers involved in what he is about to do.\n\nBehind him, a remarkably pretty young woman wheels on to the stage a second cabinet, identical to the first. She opens the door, so that the audience can see that it too is empty. With a swirl of his black cape, Borden then turns and steps briskly into the cabinet.\n\nThe drummer starts a roll.\n\nWhat happens next takes place in an instant. As the drum rolls louder, Borden removes his top hat, steps back into the cabinet, then tosses his hat high into the air. His assistant slams closed the door of the cabinet. In the same instant, the door of the first cabin we saw bursts open and Borden is now impossibly there! The cabinet he entered only moments before collapses, and folds emptily on to the floor of the stage. Borden looks up, catches his top hat, puts it on his head, then beaming and smiling steps forward to the footlights to take his bow!\n\nThe applause was loud, and I admit I joined it myself.\n\nI am damned if I know how he did that!\n\n13th November 1892.\n\nI took Cutter with me to see Borden perform his two- cabinets illusion. It happened at the Lewisham World Theatre.\n\nAs Borden produced the first of his two cabinets, I felt a thrill of anticipation. Cutter, beside me, raised his opera glasses. He was not watching the magician at all. With quick movements of the glasses, he was inspecting the rest of the stage area.\n\nI continued to watch Borden. As far as I could tell, the trick was conducted exactly as I had observed it before.\n\nFinally, beaming, bowing, he took his well-deserved applause. Cutter and I joined in.\n\nIn the taxicab running back to north London, I demanded of Cutter, \"Well, what do you think of that\"!\n\n\"Brilliant, Mr Angier\"! he stated. \"Quite brilliant! It is not often that one has the chance to see a completely new illusion\".\n\n\"Do you know how he did it\"? I insisted.\n\n\"Yes, sir, I do,\" he replied. \"And so I fancy do you\".\n\n\"I'm as baffled as ever I was. How the devil could he be in two places at once? I cannot see that it is possible\"!\n\n\"Sometimes you do surprise me, Mr Angier,\" Cutter said. \"It is a logical puzzle, solved only by the application of our own logic. What did we see before us\"?\n\n\"A man who transported himself instantly from one part of the stage to the other\".\n\n\"That is what we thought we saw, what we were intended to see. What was the reality\"?\n\n\"You still maintain he uses a double\"? I asked him. \"How else could it be effected\"?\n\n\"But you saw it as I did. That was no double! We saw him clearly before and after. He was the same man! The very same! \"Cutter winked at me, then turned away.\n\n\"Well? What do you say\"? I asked him.\n\n\"I say what I have said, Mr Angier\".\n\n\"I pay you to explain the unexplainable, Cutter. Do not trifle with me about this! It is a matter of high professional importance\"!\n\nAt this, he realized the seriousness of my mood.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said steadily. \"You must know of identical twins. There is your answer\"!\n\n\"No\"! I exclaimed.\n\n\"How else might it be done\"?\n\n\"But the first cabinet was empty.\"\n\n\"So it did appear,\" said Cutter.\n\n\"And the second cabinet collapsed the moment he left it.\"\n\n\"Very effectively too, I thought\".\n\nI knew what he was saying; these were standard stage effects for making apparatus that is concealing someone seem empty. Several of my own illusions are based on similar deceptions. My difficulty was the same I have always suffered; when I see another's illusion from the auditorium, I am as easily misdirected as anyone else. But identical twins! I had not thought of that!\n\nNow I have written down this account of the evening, I think I have to agree with him. The mystery is solved.\n\nDamn Borden! Not one man but two!\n\n30th November 1892.\n\nYesterday I obtained some remarkable facts about Borden.\n\nA young reporter from the Evening Star came to interview me. His name was Mr Arthur Koenig and he turned out to be an informant as well as an interviewer!\n\nDuring the course of a question-and-answer session, he asked me if I had any opinions I would wish to record about my magical contemporaries. I told him of the best of my colleagues.\n\n\"You have not mentioned Le Professeur,\" said my interlocutor, when I eventually paused. \"Do you not hold an opinion on his work\"?\n\n\"I regret I have not been present at any of his performances,\" I said.\n\n\"Then you must go to see his work\"! ejaculated Mr Koenig. \"His is the best show in London\"!\n\n\"Indeed\".\n\n\"I have seen his act several times,\" the reporter went on. \"There is one trick he does-\"\n\n\"I have heard of it,\" I said, interrupting him. \"Something to do with two cabinets\".\n\n\"That's the one, Mr Danton! He vanishes and reappears in a moment! No one knows how he does it\".\n\n\"No one, that is, except his fellow magicians,\" I corrected him. \"He is using standard magical procedures\".\n\n\"Then you know how it is done\"?\n\n\"Of course I know,\" I said. \"But naturally you will not expect me to reveal the exact method.\"\n\nHere I confess I was torn. Here was my chance to reveal the secret. I felt the lust for revenge that I normally suppressed. But sense prevailed once more. No magician gives away the secret of another.\n\nAt length I said, \"There are ways and means. An illusion is not what it seems. A great deal of practice and rehearsal.\" The youthful reporter practically leapt out of his seat. \"Sir, you believe he uses a twin double! Every magician in London thinks the same! I thought so too when I saw it the first time\".\n\n\"Yes, that is his method\". I was relieved to discover how straightforward he was.\n\n\"Then, sir\"! cried the young man. \"You are wrong like all the others, sir! There is no double. This is what is so amazing\"!\n\n\"He has a twin brother,\" I said. \"There is no other way\".\n\n\"It is not true. Alfred Borden has neither twin brother nor a double who can pass for him. I have personally investigated his life, and I know the truth. He works alone but for the female assistant seen on the stage with him, and a technical manager who builds his apparatus with him. In this, he is no different from any other in your profession. You too-\"\n\n\"I do have an ingenieur,\" I confirmed readily. \"But tell me more. You interest me greatly. You are certain of this information\"?\n\n\"I am\".\n\n\"Car you prove it to me\"?\n\n\"As you know, sir,\" Mr Koenig replied, \"it is not possible to prove that which does not exist. All I can say is that for the last few weeks I have been bringing journalistic methods to the investigation, and have not found a single jot of evidence to confirm what you assume\".\n\nAt this point, he produced a thin sheaf of papers and showed them to me. They contained certain information about Mr Borden that I found instantly intriguing, and I begged the reporter to let me have them.\n\nKoenig agreed to let me take handwritten extracts from several of his notes, and these I scribbled down on the spot at his dictation. At the end, I passed him five sovereigns.\n\nAs I finished, Mr Koenig said to me, \"May I ask what you are hoping to learn from this, sir\"?\n\n\"I seek only to improve my own magical art,\" I answered.\n\n\"I understand\". He stood up to leave. \"And when you have so improved, do you suppose you too will be able to perform Le Professeur's illusion\"?\n\n\"I assure you, Mr Koenig,\" I said with cold disdain, as I showed him to the door. \"I assure you that I could make his trick this very night\"!\n\nThen he was gone.\n\nToday I have not been working, and so I have written up this account of the meeting. It is imperative that I learn the secret of Borden's illusion. I can think of no sweeter revenge than to outshine him with his own trick, outperform him, outdo him in every way.\n\nFirst, though, I must check the facts I possess about Mr Borden.\n\n9th December 1892.\n\nI have in fact so far done nothing about Borden. The American tour has been confirmed as definite, and Cutter and I are preparing for it. I am going to travel for more than two whole months, and to be separated from Julia and the children for such a length of time is almost unthinkable.\n\nHowever, I cannot miss the tour. The New World is the source and location of some of the finest magicians currently in performance, and it is a magnificent compliment to be invited to undertake this tour.\n\nAnd Borden has not so far visited the USA!\n\n17th January 1893.\n\nThe last week has been a nightmare of packing and preparations, and arranging for the apparatus I need with me to be dismantled, crated, then despatched ahead of me. Nothing can be left to chance, for without my equipment I have no stage show. A lot depends on this transatlantic adventure!\n\nBut now I have a day or two of leisure in which to prepare myself mentally and relax at home for a while. The children are asleep, Julia is reading in her sitting room, and in the calm of this dark January evening, quietly in my study, I may at last record, thanks to the industrious Mr Koenig, the fruits of my enquiries about Mr Alfred Borden.\n\nThe following are facts I have personally verified.\n\nHe was born on 8th May 1856, in the Royal Sussex Hospital in Bohemia Road, Hastings. Three days after his birth, he and his mother, Betsy Mary Borden, returned to their house at 105 Manor Road, where the father worked as a carpenter. The child's full name was Frederick Andrew Borden, and according to the official records, his was a single birth. Frederick Andrew Borden was not one of two identical twins at birth, so therefore neither can he be one today.\n\nNext, I looked into the possibility of Frederick Borden having brothers of a close age to him, and bearing a strong family resemblance. Frederick was the sixth-born child. He had three older sisters and two older brothers, but of these one brother was eight years his senior, and the other had died at the age of two weeks.\n\nThere was a younger brother too. This was Albert Joseph Borden, seventh-born into the family, on 18th May 1858. (Albert + Frederick = Alfred?)\n\nAgain, the existence of a brother whose age was reasonably close to Frederick's raised the possibility of a double. I dug out and examined Albert's birth records at the hospital, but I found it difficult to ascertain much more about him. However, I decided to visit a photogenic portrait artiste called Charles Simpkins, who has his studio in Hastings High Street.\n\nMr Simpkins showed me a selection of his daguerreotypes. Amongst these, was a studio portrait of Frederick Borden and his younger brother. It had been taken in 1874, when Frederick was eighteen and his brother was sixteen.\n\nThe two are clearly unalike in appearance. Frederick is tall, he has noble features, and his bearing is arrogant, while Albert is much less attractive. He has a slack-jawed expression, his features are puffy, and his cheeks are round, his hair is wavier than his brother's and apparently paler in colour, and from his position I would say he was at least four or five inches shorter than his brother.\n\nThis portrait convinced me that Koenig was right: Frederick Borden does not have a close relation he can use as a double.\n\nIt remains possible that he has scoured the streets of London to find a man sufficiently like him to pass as a double, with the aid of stage make-up, but no matter what Cutter says I have myself seen Borden's performance. Most illusionists' doubles are only briefly glimpsed, or they misdirect the perceptions of the audience by wearing identical costumes, so that in the few seconds in which the double is visible he seems to be the original.\n\nBorden, after the transformation, allows himself to be seen, and to be seen clearly. He steps forward to the footlights, he bows, he smiles, he takes the hand of his female assistant, he bows again, he walks to and fro. There is no question but that the man who emerges from the second cabinet is the man who entered the first.\n\nI still do not know how Borden works that damnable illusion, but I do at least know that he works it alone.\n\nI am going to what is fast becoming the centre of the world of magic, and for two months I shall be meeting, and perhaps working with, some of the finest illusionists in the United States of America. There will be many there who can work out how it is done. I go to America to build my reputation, and to earn a lot of money, but I now have an extra quest.\n\nI swear that when I return in two months I shall have Borden's secret with me. I also swear that within a month of returning I shall be performing a superior version of the same trick on the London stage.\n\n13th September 1893.\n\nI am not surprised to discover that nearly eight months have elapsed since last I came to this diary to record my life.\n\nJulia and the children are gone. Cutter is gone. Much of my wealth is gone. My career has gone, through apathy.\n\nI have lost everything.\n\nBut I have gained Olivia Svenson.\n\nI have left Julia so that I might be with Olivia, after I met and fell in love with her during my American tour earlier this year. I met Olivia at a reception given in my honour in the fine city of Boston, Massachusetts, where she approached me and made her admiration known, in the way many women have approached me in the past. Olivia, then working as a danseuse, joined my party. When I left Boston she remained with us, and then we travelled together. More than this, within a week or two she was working on stage with me as my assistant, and has returned with me to London.\n\nCutter did not care for this, and we parted immediately on our return.\n\nAs, inevitably, did Julia and I. Sometimes, even now, I lie awake at night to marvel at the madness of my sacrifice. Once Julia meant the very world to me, and indeed, she helped build the world I inhabit today. My children, my three helpless and innocent children, are nothing less than victims of the same sacrifice. All I can say is that my madness is the madness of love; Olivia blinds me to every other feeling that is not passion for her.\n\nSo I cannot bring myself to write down, even in the privacy of this journal, what was said, done and suffered at that time. Much of the saying and doing was mine, while all the suffering was Julia's.\n\nI now support Julia in a household of her own, where to maintain appearances she lives the life of a widow. She has the children with her, she has her material needs taken care of, and she does not have to see me again if she does not want to. Indeed, if I were seen at her house the appearances would be betrayed, so I have become a dead man. I can never meet my children in their own house again, and have to make do with the occasional excursion with them.\n\nJulia and I meet briefly on such occasions, and her sweetness of nature tortures me. But there is no going back. I have made my bed and now I lie in it. When I manage to close my mind to the family I have lost, I am a happy man. I expect no favourable judgement of myself. I know I have wronged my wife.\n\nI have always tried never to hurt the people around me. Even in my dealings with Borden I have shrunk from causing him pain or danger, preferring to take revenge by irritating or embarrassing him. But now I find I have caused the greatest hurt of all, to the four people who meant the most to me. At the risk of humbug, I can only swear that I shall never do anything like this again.\n\n14th September 1893.\n\nMy career struggles towards a new version of stability.\n\nI feel at last I can emerge from the hole of misery and lethargy into which I declined, and I am ready to return to the stage. I have instructed Unwin to find me bookings, and my career may resume.\n\nTo celebrate the decision, Olivia and I went this afternoon to the premises of a theatrical costumier, where she chose, and was measured for, her new stage outfit.\n\n1st December 1893.\n\nIn my appointments book I have a thirty-minute Christmas show that I am to perform for a school of orphans. Other than that, my book is empty. Since the end of September, I have earned only 18 pounds 18s.\n\nHesketh Unwin speaks of a whispering campaign against me. He warns me to neglect it, because the success of my tour of America is well known and it is easy to cause jealousy.\n\nI am disturbed by this news. Is Borden behind it?\n\nI occupy my days with practice and rehearsal. Although my skill with prestidigitation increases, sometimes, in my darker moments, I do wonder why I am continuing to rehearse at all.\n\nAt least the orphans will see a marvellous entertainment!\n\n14th December 1893.\n\nBookings have been made for January and February. Our spirits have risen.\n\n20th December 1893.\n\nMore bookings for January, one of them, I do declare, left vacant by a certain Professeur de la Magie! I am happy to take his guineas.\n\n23rd December 1893.\n\nA Happy Christmas! Unwin has sent me the contract for my appearance on 19th January at the Princess Royal Theatre in Streatham. This is the booking left free by Borden. I was glancing through the contract when my gaze fell on one of the clauses toward the end. It read that my performance should be to the same general standard of excellence as the act that was being replaced.\n\nI think I could at last perform Borden's illusion.\n\nI am so taken with the idea that I have been dashing around London all day, trying to find someone who will act as my double. This is the wrong time of year to be looking; all the unemployed actors are working in the numerous pantomimes and Christmas shows around the town.\n\nI have just over three weeks in which to prepare. Tomorrow I shall start to build the cabinets!\n\n4th January 1894.\n\nAt last, I have my man! His name is Gerald William Root, an actor... and regular drunkard and brawler. Mr Root is however desperate for cash, and I have drawn from him a promise that so long as he works for me he shall only taste liquor after each performance. The cash that I am able to offer him is so generous, by his usual standards, that I believe I can purchase his reliability.\n\nHe is the same height as me, and his general stance and figure are roughly mine. He is a little stouter than I am, but either he will lose those extra folds of flesh, or I shall wear padding. It is of no concern. Although his eyes are an impure blue, while mine are the colour generally described as hazel, the difference is not noticeable, and again we can use theatrical make-up to misdirect attention.\n\nNone of the details matters. More potentially serious is the problem of his gait, which is noticeably looser than mine, with longer strides, and his feet turn slightly outwards as he walks. Olivia has taken charge of the problem, and believes she can coach him in time. As any actor knows, you convey more about a character with a walk or a bearing than any number of facial characteristics, accents or gestures. If my double walks differently from me while on the stage he will not be mistaken for me. It is as simple as that.\n\nRoot says that he understands the problem. Provided that on the night he is mistaken for me, he will have earned his money.\n\nA fortnight remains in which to rehearse.\n\n18th January 1894.\n\nI am nervous about tomorrow's performance, even though Root and I have rehearsed it until we are sick of it. In perfection lies a risk; if tomorrow I perform Borden's illusion, and improve on it, and I shall, word that I have done so will reach him within days.\n\nI know there is yet a terrible truth that I have not faced up to. It is that Borden will instantly know the means by which I have brought off the illusion, but I still do not know his.\n\n20th January 1894.\n\nIt was a triumph! Today, the Morning Post describes me as \"probably Britain's greatest living illusionist\".\n\nIt is sweet. But it also has a sour side I had not anticipated! At the conclusion of the illusion, it is the drunkard Root who takes the ovation, who holds Olivia's hand in his, who bows and waves and blows kisses.\n\nAnd I can only wait for the darkness of the stage when the curtain descends, before I make my escape.\n\nThis will have to change. We must arrange it that I am the one who emerges from the unexpected cabinet, so the switch with Root must be made before the illusion begins. I shall have to think of a way.\n\n21st January 1894.\n\nYesterday's notice in the Post has made its impact, and already today, my agent has taken three bookings for my act.\n\nI have rewarded Root with a small cash bonus.\n\n30th June 1895.\n\nAlready the events of two years ago seem like a fading nightmare. I return to this journal merely to record that I am once again on an even keel. Olivia and I co-exist harmoniously.\n\nI intend another discussion with Root, since the last one had little effect. In spite of the excellence of his performance he is a trouble to me, and another reason for returning to this diary is to record the fact that he and I will have to talk seriously.\n\n7th July 1895.\n\nThere is a cardinal rule in the world of magic that you do not antagonize your assistants. This is because they know many of your secrets, and they therefore have a particular power over you.\n\nIf I fire Root, I shall be at his mercy.\n\nThe problem he presents is partly his alcoholic addiction, and partly his arrogance.\n\nHe has often been drunk during my performance, a fact he does not deny. He claims he can handle it. The trouble is that there is no controlling the behaviour of a heavy drinker, and I am terrified that one evening he will be too drunk to take part.\n\nHis arrogance is a worse problem. He is convinced that I am unable to function effectively without him, and whenever he is around me, I have to suffer a constant stream of advice based on his years of experience as an actor.\n\nLast night we had a \"discussion\". He said the words I most feared to hear, that he could expose my secrets and ruin my career.\n\nAnd worse. He has somehow found out about my relationship with Sheila Macpherson. I am being blackmailed, of course. I need him, and he knows it. He has power over me, and I know it.\n\nI was forced even to offer him a raise in his performance fees, and this, of course, he promptly accepted.\n\n24th August 1895.\n\nI learnt today that Borden is taking his magical show on a tour of Europe and the Levant, and that he will be out of England until the end of the year. Curiously, he will not be performing his own version of the two-cabinet illusion.\n\nHesketh Unwin informed me of this when I saw him earlier today.\n\n25th August 1895.\n\nI finally realized that with Borden out of the country, I have no need to keep performing the switch illusion, and so without delay I have given Root the sack!\n\nBy the time, Borden returns from his tour abroad, either I shall have replaced Mr Root or I shall no longer be performing the illusion at all.\n\n14th November 1895.\n\nNext week, when I open for a short season at the Royal County Theatre in Reading, my assistant will be a young lady I have been training for the last two weeks. Her name is Gertrude, she is blessed with a supple and beautiful body. She is the fiancee of my other new employee, a carpenter and apparatus technician named Adam Wilson. I am paying them both well, and am satisfied with their contributions so far to my act.\n\nAdam, I must record, is an almost exact double for me in terms of physique, and I shall keep him in mind as Root's replacement.\n\n12th February 1896.\n\nI have tonight learned the meaning of the phrase one's blood runs cold.\n\nI was engaged in one of my customary tricks with playing cards in the first half of my show. In this, I ask a member of the audience to select a card and then to write his name upon it in full view of the audience. When this is done, I take the card from him and tear it up before his eyes, tossing aside the pieces. Moments later, I show a live canary in a metal cage. When my volunteer takes the cage from me it mysteriously collapses in his hand (the bird vanishes from sight), and leaves him holding the remains of the cage in which can be seen a single playing card. When he removes it, he discovers that it is the very one on which his name is inscribed. The trick ends, and the volunteer returns to his seat.\n\nTonight, at the conclusion of the trick, as I beamed towards the audience in anticipation of the applause, I heard the fellow say, \"Here, this isn't my card\"!\n\nI turned towards him. The fool was standing there with the remains of the cage in one hand, and the playing card in the other. He was trying to read it.\n\n\"Let me take it, sir\"! I boomed theatrically, preparing to cover the mistake with a sudden production of a multitude of coloured streamers, which I keep on hand for such a case.\n\nI tried to snatch the card from him, but he swung away from me, shouting in a triumphant voice, \"Look, it's got something else written on it\"!\n\nFinally, I snatched the card out of his hand, showered him with coloured streamers, signalled the bandmaster, and waved the audience to applaud.\n\nIn the swelling music, I stood paralysed, reading the words that had been written there.\n\nThey said, \"I know the address you go to with Sheila Macpherson - Abracadabra! - Alfred Borden\".\n\nThe card was the one I had forced on the volunteer for the trick.\n\nI simply do not know how I managed to get through the rest of the performance, but somehow I did so.\n\n18th February 1896.\n\nLast night I travelled alone to the Empire Theatre in Cambridge where Borden was performing. As he went through the conventional illusion with a cabinet, I stood up in my seat in the auditorium and denounced him. As loudly as I could I informed the audience that an assistant was already concealed inside the cabinet. I immediately left the theatre.\n\nThen, unexpectedly, I found I had to pay a price for what I had done. Conscience struck me as I took my long, cold and solitary train journey back to London. I bitterly regretted what I had done. The ease with which I destroyed his magic appalled me. Magic is illusion, a temporary suspension of reality for the benefit and amusement of an audience. What right had T (or he, when he took his turn) to destroy that illusion?\n\nOnce, long ago, after Julia lost our first baby, Borden wrote to me and apologized for what he had done. Foolishly, I rejected him. Now the time has come when I anxiously desire to cease the feud between us. How much longer do two grown men have to keep sniping at each other in public, to settle some score that no one but they even know about?\n\nAll through that cold journey back to Liverpool Street Station, I wondered how it might be achieved. Now, twenty- four hours later, I still think about it. I shall brace myself, write to him, call an end to it, and suggest a private meeting to beat out any remaining scores that he feels have to be settled.\n\n20th February 1896.\n\nToday, after she had opened her letters, Olivia came to me and said, \"You're still seeing Sheila Macpherson, right\"?\n\nLater, she showed me the note she had received. It was from Borden!\n\n27th February 1896.\n\nI have made peace with myself, with Olivia, even with Borden!\n\nLet me simply record that I have promised Olivia I shall never see Miss Macpherson again (nor shall I), and that my love for her is undying.\n\nAnd I have decided that never again, shall I conduct a feud with Alfred Borden, no matter how provoked I feel. I still expect a public revenge from him for my outburst in Cambridge, but I shall ignore him.\n\n5th March 1896.\n\nSooner even than I had expected, Borden tried successfully to humiliate me while I was performing a well-known but popular illusion called Trilby. (It is the one where the assistant lies on a board balanced between two chair backs, then is seen to float apparently unaided in the air when the chairs are removed.) Borden had somehow secreted himself backstage.\n\nAs I removed the second chair from beneath Gertrude's board, the concealing backdrop lifted quickly to reveal Adam Wilson crouched behind, operating the mechanism.\n\nI brought down the main curtains, and discontinued my act.\n\nI shall not take revenge.\n\n31st March 1896.\n\nAnother Borden incident. So soon after the last!\n\n17th May 1896.\n\nAnother Borden incident.\n\nThis one puzzles me, for I had already established he was also performing this same evening, but somehow he got across London to the Great Western Hotel to sabotage my performance.\n\nAgain, I shall not take revenge.\n\n13th May 1897.\n\nAfter many long hours of work and rehearsal, Adam and I have developed our cabinet switching routine to a standard, which I know cannot be bettered. Adam, after eighteen months working closely with me, can imitate my movements and mannerisms with accuracy. He is my double to the last detail.\n\nYet each time we perform it, our audiences declare themselves, by their unenthusiastic applause, to be unimpressed.\n\nI do not know what I have to do to better the illusion.\n\n1st June 1897.\n\nI have been hearing rumours for some time that Borden has \"improved\" his switch illusion, but without further information, I have taken no notice. It is years since I saw him performing it, and so yesterday evening I and Adam Wilson went to a theatre in Nottingham, where Borden has been in residence for the last week.\n\nI disguised myself with greyed hair, cheek pads, untidy clothes, a pair of unnecessary eyeglasses, and took a seat only two rows from the front. I was just a few feet away from Borden as he performed all his tricks.\n\nEverything is suddenly explained! Borden has substantially advanced his version of the illusion. He no longer conceals himself inside cabinets. There is no more stuff-and-nonsense with some object tossed across the stage (which I have been continuing to work with until this week). And he does not use a double.\n\nI say with certainty: Borden does not use a double. I know everything there is to know about doubles. I can spot one as easily as I can spot a cloud in the sky. I am as sure as I can be that Borden works alone.\n\nThe audience saw an array of jars fuming with chemicals, cabinets decorated with coiling cables, glass tubes, and above all a host of gleaming electrical wires. It was a glimpse into the laboratory of a scientific fiend.\n\nBorden strolled around the equipment, lecturing the audience on the perils of working with electrical power. At certain moments, he touched one wire against another, or to a flask of gas, and there came an alarming flash of light, or a loud bang. Sparks flew around him, and a mist of blue smoke began to float about his head.\n\nWhen he was ready to perform, he indicated that a roll of drums be played from the orchestra pit. He seized two heavy wires, brought them dramatically together and made an electrical connection.\n\nIn the brilliant flash that followed, the switch took place. Before our very eyes, Borden vanished from where he was standing, and he instantly reappeared on the other side of the stage - at least twenty feet away from where he had been!\n\nBorden stepped forward in wild applause to take his bow.\n\nThe applause continued for long afterwards, and I report that my hands were clapping as loudly as anyone's.\n\nWhy should this fellow-magician, so gifted, so endowed with skill and professionalism, pursue a vicious feud against me?\n\n5th March 1898.\n\nI have been working hard, with little time for the diary. Today I have no bookings, so I may make a brief entry.\n\nAdam and I have not included our switch illusion in my act since that night in Nottingham.\n\nBorden has interrupted my acts twice. One of the attacks I was able to joke away, but the other was for a few minutes a disaster.\n\nI have as a result abandoned my facade of silent contempt.\n\nI am left with two ambitions. The first is to achieve some kind of reconciliation with Julia and the children. I know I have lost her forever, but the distance she puts between us is terrible to endure. The second is minor in comparison. Now that my unilateral truce with Borden has ended, I wish to discover the secret of his illusion so that I might again outperform him.\n\n31st July 1898.\n\nOlivia has proposed an idea!\n\nBefore describing it, I should say that in recent months the passion between Olivia and myself has noticeably cooled. We continue to cohabit peacefully, and at times we have behaved as man and wife, but overall we no longer act as if we love or care for each other. Yet we cling together.\n\nToday after dinner, Olivia left me, taking with her a bottle of gin. I have grown used to her solitary drinking, and no longer remark on it.\n\nA few minutes later, though, her maid, Lucy, came up and asked me if I would step downstairs for a few minutes.\n\nI found Olivia seated at her card table, with two or three bottles and two glasses standing on it, and an empty chair opposite her. She waved me to sit down, and then poured me a drink.\n\n\"Robbie,\" she said with her familiar directness. \"I'm going to leave you\".\n\nI mumbled something in reply. I have been expecting some such development for months, although I had no idea how I would cope with it.\n\n\"I'm going to leave you,\" she said again, \"and then I'm going to come back. Do you want to know why\"?\n\nI said that I did.\n\n\"Because there's something you want more than you want me. I figure that if I get out there and find it for you, then I have a chance to make you want me all over again\".\n\nI assured her I wanted her as much as ever I had, but she cut me short.\n\n\"I know what's going on,\" she declared. \"You and this Alfred Borden are like two lovers who can't get along together. Am I right\"?\n\nI tried to prevaricate, but when I saw the determination in her eyes, I quickly agreed.\n\n\"Look at this\"! she said, and showed this week's copy of The Stage. \"See here\". She folded the paper in half and passed it across to me. She had circled one of the classified advertisements on the front page.\n\n\"That's your friend Borden,\" she said. \"See what he says\"?\n\nAn attractive young female stage assistant is required for full-time employment. She must be strong and fit, and willing to travel and to work long hours, both on and off stage. Pleasing appearance is essential, and so is a willingness to participate in exciting and demanding routines before large audiences. Please apply, with suitable references, too.\n\nThe address of Alfred Borden's rehearsal room followed.\n\n\"He's been advertising for an assistant for a couple of weeks. I guess I could help him out\".\n\n\"You mean you-\"\n\n\"You always said I was the best assistant you ever had\".\n\n\"But you -? Going to work for him\"? I shook my head sadly. \"How could you do this to me, Olivia\"?\n\n\"You want to find out how he does that trick, don't you\"? she said.\n\nI sat silently before her, staring at her. If she could gain his confidence, work with him in rehearsal and on stage, move freely in his workshop, it would not be long before Borden's secret was mine.\n\nWe soon got down to details.\n\nThe need to supply references seemed for a time to be a problem, because Olivia had worked for no one but me, but she pointed out that I was entirely capable of forging letters.\n\nTwo hours or more went quickly by while we discussed her idea, and began to lay our plans. We emptied the bottle of gin, while Olivia kept saying, \"I'll get the secret for you, Robbie. That's what you want me to do, isn't it\"? And I said yes, but that I did not want to lose her.\n\nI was torn between the euphoria of making a definitive strike against him, and the prospect of him taking some even greater revenge if he realized Olivia was mine. I voiced these fears. She replied, \"I'll come back to you Robbie, and I'll bring you Borden's secret\". We were soon drunk, playful and affectionate.\n\nI must go to forge one or two testimonials for her. We are using the address of her maid for poste restante; she is taking her mother's maiden name.\n\n14th August 1898.\n\nBorden has replied (at least, an assistant called T. Elbourne replied on his behalf), suggesting an interview early next week.\n\nI am suddenly against it, having in the last few days found a renewal of happiness with Olivia, and more unwilling than ever to see her fall into Borden's clutches.\n\nOlivia still wants to go through with it.\n\n18th August 1898.\n\nOlivia has been to the interview and returned from it, and she says the job is hers.\n\nWhile she was gone, I was in a torment of fears and regrets.\n\nOlivia was gone far longer than either of us had expected, and I was seriously wondering what I should do when suddenly she arrived back. She was elated and excited.\n\nYes, the job is hers. Yes, Borden read the references I had written, and he accepted them as genuine. No, there was no apparent suspicion of me.\n\nShe told me about some of the apparatus she had seen in his workshop, but it was all disappointingly ordinary.\n\n\"Did he say anything at all about the switch illusion\"? I queried her.\n\n\"Not a word. But he told me there were several tricks he did alone, and for which he did not need a stage assistant\".\n\nLater, saying she was tired, she went to sleep.\n\n27th August 1898.\n\nThe end of another week, and still Olivia has no information for me. She seems unwilling to talk to me about it.\n\nTonight she gave me a free pass to Borden's next series of performances. Olivia will be on stage with him.\n\n3rd September 1898.\n\nOlivia has not returned home at all this evening. I am mystified, alarmed, and full of fears.\n\n4th September 1898.\n\nI sent a boy to Borden's workshop with a message for her, but he returned to say the place was bolted up with no one apparently inside.\n\n12th September 1898.\n\nWith no further sign of Olivia returning home, I took the pass she had given me and went to the box office of the Leicester Square Theatre. Here I claimed a ticket for Borden's show. I deliberately selected a seat near the rear of the stalls, so that my presence might not be noticed from the stage.\n\nI saw Olivia. Her appearance quickened my pulse.\n\nBorden climaxed his show with the electrical switch illusion, performing it with a flair that plunged me further into depression. When Olivia returned to the stage to take the final bow with him, my gloom was complete. She looked beautiful, happy and excited, and it seemed to my troubled gaze that as Borden held her hand for the applause he did so with unnecessary affection.\n\nDetermined to see the thing through, I raced from the auditorium and hurried around to the Stage Door. Although I waited while the other artistes left, and until the doorman had locked the door and turned off the lights, I saw neither Borden nor Olivia departing the building.\n\n18th September 1898.\n\nToday Olivia's maid brought me a letter she had received from her mistress.\n\nI read it anxiously, clinging to the hope that it might contain a clue as to what had happened, but it merely said:\n\nLucy,\n\nWould you kindly make up packages and cases of all my belongings, and have them delivered as soon as possible to the Stage Door of the Strand Theatre.\n\nPlease be sure that everything is clearly labelled as being for myself, and I will arrange collection.\n\nI enclose an amount to cover the costs, and that which is left over you must keep for yourself if you require a reference for your next employment, Mr Angler will of course write it for you.\n\nThank you,\n\nOlivia Svenson\n\nI had to read this letter aloud to the poor girl, and to explain what she had to do with the five-pound note Olivia had enclosed.\n\n4th December 1898.\n\nI am currently engaged for a season of shows at the Plaza Theatre in Richmond, by the side of the River Thames. This evening, I was relaxing in my dressing room between first and second performances, when someone knocked on the door.\n\nIt was Olivia. I let her into the room. She looked beautiful but tired, and told me she had been trying to locate me all day.\n\n\"Robbie, I have gotten you the information you want,\" she said, and she held up a sealed envelope for me to see. \"I brought you this, even though you must understand that I'm not going to come back to you. You have to promise me that your feud with Alfred will end immediately. If you do, I'll let you have the envelope\".\n\nI told her that as far as I was concerned the feud was already at an end.\n\n\"Then why do you still need his secret\"?\n\n\"You surely know why,\" I said.\n\n\"Only to continue the feud\"!\n\nI knew she was touching the truth, but I said, \"I'm curious\".\n\nShe was in a hurry to depart, saying that already Borden would be suspicious of her long absence.\n\nFinally, she handed over the envelope.\n\nHolding it, I said, \"Is it really the end of the mystery for me\"?\n\n\"I believe it is, yes\".\n\nShe turned to go and opened the door.\n\n\"Can I ask you something else, Olivia\"?\n\n\"What is it\"?\n\n\"Is Borden one man, or two\"?\n\nShe smiled, and maddeningly I glimpsed the smile of a woman thinking of her lover. \"He is just one man, I do assure you\".\n\nI followed her out into the corridor.\n\n\"Are you happy now\"? I asked her.\n\n\"Yes, I am. I'm sorry if I've hurt you, Robbie\".\n\nShe left me then, without an embrace or even a smile or a touch of hands. It was painful.\n\nI returned to the dressing room, closed the door and slit the envelope at once. It contained one sheet of paper, and there was a single word.\n\nTesla.\n\n10th July 1900.\n\nColorado Springs, Colorado\n\nI have found a modest but attractive hotel, suitable for my needs, and because I liked my room on sight, I have registered for a week's stay with an option to extend it if necessary.\n\nFrom the window of my room, I can see two of the three features of Colorado Springs that have brought me here.\n\nThe whole town dances with electric lights after the sun has set; the streets have tall lamps, every house has brightly illuminated windows.\n\nThe famous mountain stands beside the town: Pike's Peak, nearly 15,000 feet in height.\n\nTomorrow, I shall make my first ascent of the lower slopes of Pike's Peak, and seek out the third remarkable feature that has brought me to this town.\n\n12th July 1900.\n\nI was too weary to write in my diary yesterday evening, but today I am alone here in the town, so I have plenty of opportunity to describe what happened.\n\nI was awake at an early hour, took my breakfast in the hotel, and walked quickly to the central square of the town where my carriage was supposed to be waiting for me. This was something I had arranged by letter before leaving London.\n\nIn the casual American manner, my man and I quickly became great friends. His name is Randall D. Gilpin, a Colorado man born and bred. I call him Randy, and he calls me Robbie. He is short and round, with a great circling of grey whiskers about his cheerful face. His eyes are blue, and his hair, like the whiskers, is steel-grey. He wears a hat made of leather. He carries a rifle under the seat from which he drives the horses, and he told me he keeps it loaded.\n\nThe route to Nikola Tesla's laboratory is a steady climb across the eastern face of the great mountain.\n\nAfter an hour and a half, we came to a plateau, on the northeast face of the mountain, and here no trees grew at all. In the centre of this small plateau, was Tesla's laboratory.\n\n\"You got business here, Robbie\"? said Randy. \"You watch how you go. It can get dangerous up here, from what folks say\".\n\n\"I know the risks,\" I said. Randy told me that he had business of his own to attend to, but would return to the laboratory in the afternoon and wait for me until I appeared.\n\nI noticed that he would not take the carriage too close to the building, and I had to walk the last four or five hundred yards by myself.\n\nThe laboratory was a square construction with sloping roofs, built with unpainted wood. In the centre of the building, rising vertically was a tall metal pole at the top of which was a large metal sphere. This was glinting in the bright morning sunshine and waving gently to and fro in the fresh breeze that was blowing along the mountainside.\n\nOn each side of the path, a number of technical instruments of obscure purpose had been set on the ground. There were many metal poles driven into the stony soil, and most of these were connected to each other with insulated wires. Close by the side of the main building was a wooden frame with a glass wall, inside which I saw several measuring dials or registers.\n\nI heard a sudden and violent crackling sound, and from within the building there came a series of brilliant and horrific flashes: white, blue-white, pink-white, repeated rapidly.\n\nI confess that at this moment my resolve briefly failed. My faint heart became even fainter when, within two or three more steps, I came upon a hand-painted sign mounted on the wall beside the main door. It said:\n\nGREAT DANGER.\n\nKeep Out!\n\nAs I read this the electric discharges from within died away. I banged my fist on the door.\n\nAfter a wait of a few moments, Nikola Tesla himself opened the door. His expression was the abstracted one of a busy man who has been irritatingly interrupted. It was not a good start, but I made the best of it.\n\n\"Mr Tesla\"? I said. \"My name is Rupert Angier. I wonder if you recall our correspondence? I have been writing to you from England\".\n\n\"I know nobody in England\"! He was staring behind me, as if wondering how many more Englishmen I had brought with me. \"Say your name again, good sir\"?\n\n\"My name is Rupert Angier. I was present at your demonstration in London, and was greatly interested.\"\n\n\"You are the magician! The one Mr Alley knows all about\"?\n\n\"I am the magician,\" I confirmed, although the meaning of his second question was not clear to me.\n\n\"You may enter\"!\n\nSo many impressions about him at once. I noticed his face first. It was thin, intelligent and handsome, with strong Slavic cheekbones. He wore a thin moustache, and his hair was parted in the middle. He looked like a man who worked long hours and slept only when there was no alternative to exhaustion.\n\nTesla is equipped with an extraordinary mind. Once I had made my identity clear to him he remembered not only what we had corresponded briefly about, but that I had written to him earlier, some eight years ago, asking for a copy of his notes.\n\nInside the laboratory, he introduced me to his assistant, Mr Alley. This interesting man appears to fulfil many roles in Tesla's life, from scientific assistant and collaborator, to domestic servant and companion. Mr Alley declared himself to be an admirer of my work! He had been in the audience during my show in Kansas City in 1893, and spoke briefly but knowledgeably about magic.\n\nBy all appearances, the two men work in the laboratory alone.\n\nTesla seemed relaxed in my company. He interrogated me about the use of electricity in Britain, how widespread it was becoming. Eventually, the focus of his questions turned to myself, my career, my interest in electricity, and to what uses I might wish to put it.\n\nI let him direct our conversation, and for an hour or two, he told me about his conflicts with Edison, his struggles against bureaucracy and the scientific establishment, and most of all his successes. His present laboratory had been funded by the work of the last few years. He had installed the first water-powered city-sized electricity generator in the world; the generating station was at Niagara Falls, and the beneficiary city was Buffalo, it is true to say that Tesla had made his fortune at Niagara, but like many men of sudden wealth he wondered how long he could make last what he had.\n\nAs gently as I could I kept the conversation centred on money, because this is one of the few subjects where our interests genuinely meet. Nothing was discussed between us that touched directly on the reason for my visit here, but there will be plenty of time for that in the days ahead. Yesterday, we were just getting to know one another, and learning of each other's interests.\n\nI have said little of the dominant feature of his laboratory. During the long conversation, we were overshadowed by the bulk of his Experimental Coil. Indeed, the entire laboratory can be said to be the Coil, for there is little else there apart from recording and calibrating apparatus.\n\nThe Coil is immense. Tesla said that it had a diameter exceeding fifty feet. Constructed around a central core (the base of the tall metal pole that I had seen protruding through the roof), the Coil is wound around numerous wooden and metal battens. I could make no sense of its design. I grasped that it was capable of using or transforming huge amounts of electricity. The power for it is sent up the mountain from Colorado Springs below; Tesla has paid for this by installing the town generators himself!\n\n\"I have all the electricity I want\"! he said. \"As you will probably find during the evenings\".\n\nI asked him what he meant.\n\n\"You will notice that from time to time the town lights momentarily dim. Sometimes they even go off altogether for a few seconds. It means we are at work up here! Let me show you\".\n\nHe led me out of the building and across the uneven ground outside. After a short distance, we came to a place where the side of the mountain dropped steeply away, and there, a long way below, was the whole extent of Colorado Springs.\n\n\"If you come up here one night I'll demonstrate,\" he promised. \"With a pull on one lever I can plunge that whole city into the dark\".\n\nAs we headed back, he said, \"You must indeed visit me one night. Night-time is the finest time in the mountains. It is a mistake to look down or around. The real interest is above us\"! He gestured towards the sky. \"I have never known such clarity of air, such moonlight. Nor have I ever seen such storms as occur here! I chose this site because of the frequency of storms. There is one coming at this moment, as it happens\".\n\nI glanced around me, but the sky was blue in every direction.\n\n\"The storm will arrive after seven this evening, in fact, let us examine my coherer, from which we can determine the exact time\".\n\nWe walked back to the laboratory. As we did so, I noticed that Randy Gilpin and his carriage had arrived, and were parked well away from where we were. Randy waved to me, and I waved back.\n\nTesla indicated one of the instruments I had noted earlier.\n\n\"This shows that a storm is currently in the region of Central City, about eighty miles to the north of us. Watch\"!\n\nHe indicated a part of the device that could be seen through a magnifying lens, and jabbed a finger at it at odd moments. After peering at it for a while, I saw what he was trying to indicate - a tiny electrical spark was bridging the visible gap between two metal studs.\n\n\"Each time it sparks it is registering a flash of lightning,\" Tesla explained. \"Sometimes I will note the discharge here, and more than an hour later I will hear the thunder rumbling in from far away\".\n\nTesla had moved to another instrument and noted down two or three readings from it. I followed him to it.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Mr Angier, would you be good enough to look at your clock this evening, and note the moment when you see the first flash of lightning. By my calculation it should be between 7 15 pm and 7 20 pm\".\n\n\"You can predict the exact moment\"? I said.\n\n\"Within about five minutes\".\n\n\"Then you could make your fortune with this alone\"! I exclaimed.\n\nHe looked uninterested.\n\n\"It is peripheral,\" he said. \"My work is purely experimental, and my main concern is to know when a storm is going to break so that I might make the best use of it\". He glanced over to where Gilpin was waiting. \"I see your carriage has returned, Mr Angier. You plan to make another visit to see me\"?\n\n\"I came to Colorado Springs for one reason only,\" I said. \"That is so that I might put a business proposition to you\".\n\n\"The best kind of proposition, in my experience,\" Tesla said gravely. \"I shall expect you the day after tomorrow\".\n\nHe explained that today was going to be taken up by a trip to the railhead to collect some more equipment.\n\nWith this I departed, and soon returned with Gilpin to the town.\n\nI must record that at exactly 7 19 pm there was a flash of lightning visible in the town, followed soon after by a crack of thunder. There then began a spectacular storm.\n\n13th July 1900.\n\nToday Tesla suggested I might like to take a walk with him.\n\n\"Perhaps now is the time when we should quietly discuss business. May I beg details of what you have in mind\"?\n\n\"This is what I am not entirely sure about.\" I began, and paused, trying to formulate the words.\n\n\"Do you propose to invest in my researches\"?\n\n\"No, sir, I do not,\" I was able to say. \"Let me say candidly that I am a wealthy man, Mr Tesla. I hope I might be able to assist you\".\n\n\"But not by investment, you say\".\n\n\"By purchase,\" I replied. \"I wish you to build me an electrical apparatus\".\n\n\"Which piece of apparatus do you require\"? he said. \"As you have seen my work is theoretical, experimental. None of it is for sale, and everything I am using at present is invaluable to me\".\n\n\"Before I left England,\" I said, \"I read a new article about your work in The Times. In the article, it was said that you had discovered on a theoretical basis that electricity might be transmitted through the air, and that you planned to demonstrate the principle in the near future. Many of your scientific colleagues have apparently said it is impossible, but you are confident of what you are doing. Would this be true\"?\n\nI stared directly into Tesla's eyes as I asked this final question, and saw that his expression and gestures became animated and expressive.\n\n\"Yes, it is entirely true\"! he cried, and at once launched into a wild and (to me) fairly incomprehensible account of what he planned.\n\nThe essence of what he said was that he had long ago established that the most efficient way of transmitting his polyphase electrical current was to boost it to high voltages and direct it along high-tension cables. Now he was able to show that if the current was boosted to an even greater voltage then it became of extremely high frequency, and no cables at all would be required. The current would be sent out, radiated, cast broadly into the aether, whereupon by a series of detectors or receivers the electricity could be captured once more and turned to use.\n\nWe had circled the large area of ground twice, and I kept my pace beside him.\n\nFinally, I said, \"Tell me this: if electrical energy may be transmitted, could physical matter also be sent from one place to another\"?\n\nThe steadiness of his answer surprised me. He said, \"Energy and matter are but two manifestations of the same force. Surely you realize this\"?\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I said.\n\n\"Then you already know the answer. Though I must add that I cannot see why anyone should wish to transmit matter\".\n\n\"But could you make me the apparatus that would achieve this\"?\n\n\"How much mass would be involved? What weight would there be? What size object\"?\n\n\"Never more than two hundred pounds,\" I said. \"And the size... let us say two yards in height, at most\".\n\nHe waved a hand dismissively. \"What sum are you offering me\"?\n\n\"What sum do you require\"?\n\n\"I desperately need eight thousand dollars, Mr Angier\".\n\nIt was more than I had planned, but still it was within my means.\n\nA few moments later, we were embracing on that windy plateau, clapping our hands against each other's shoulders.\n\nAs we drew apart, and clasped hands in contract together, a loud peal of thunder rang out somewhere in the mountains behind us, and rolled around us, rumbling and echoing in the narrow passes.\n\n14th July 1900.\n\nToday Tesla has quizzed me more closely about what I require of him. He is incurious about the magical effect I plan to achieve, but is concerned instead with practicalities. The size of the apparatus, the source of power for it, the weight it will need to be, the degree of portability required.\n\nI find myself admiring his analytical mind. Portability was one aspect I had not thought about at all, but of course, this is a critical factor for a touring magician.\n\nTesla's reaction to my project has finally convinced me of something that until now I have only suspected. Borden has not been to Tesla!\n\nI am learning about my old rival. Through Olivia, he was trying to misdirect me. His illusion uses the sort of flashy effects that ordinary people think are the power of electricity, but are in fact nothing more than flashy effects.\n\nBut Tesla works slowly! I am anxious about the passage of time. Naively, I had thought that once I commissioned Tesla it would be a matter of hours before he produced the mechanism I required. I see, by the abstracted expression he bears as he mutters to himself, that I have started a process of invention that might know no practical end.\n\nI have firm bookings in England in October and November, and must be home well before the first of them.\n\n8th August 1900.\n\nTesla told me on my arrival at the laboratory this morning that my apparatus was ready for demonstration, and in a state of great excitement, I readied myself to see it. When it came to it, though, the thing refused to function, and after I had watched Tesla fiddling with some of the wiring for more than three hours I returned here to the hotel.\n\n12th August 1900.\n\nAnother abortive demonstration today. I was disappointed by the outcome. Tesla seemed puzzled, claiming that his calculations could not be in error.\n\nThe failure is briefly recorded. The prototype apparatus is a smaller version of his Coil, with the wiring arranged in a different fashion. After a prolonged lecture about the principles (none of which I understood), Tesla produced a metal rod which he or Mr Alley had painted in a distinctive orange colour. He placed it on a platform, immediately beneath a kind of inverted cone of wiring; the apex of the cone focused directly on the rod.\n\nWhen at Tesla's instruction Mr Alley worked a large lever situated close by the original Coil, there was the noisy outburst of electrical discharge. Almost at once, the orange rod was surrounded by blue-white fire, which snaked around it in a most intimidating way. The noise and incandescence built up quickly, and soon it seemed as if molten particles of the rod itself were splashing to the floor.\n\nAfter a few seconds Tesla waved his hands dramatically, M r Alley threw back the control lever, the electricity instantly died away, and the rod was still in place.\n\nTesla immediately became absorbed in the mystery. Mr Alley has recommended me to stay away from the laboratory for a few days, but I am acutely conscious of time running out.\n\n18th August 1900.\n\nToday, after the orange-painted rod had failed to move again, Tesla picked it up and offered it to me to hold. A few seconds before it had been bathed in radiant light, with sparks flying in every direction. I took it from him, expecting my fingers to be burned by it. Instead, it was cold. This is the odd thing: it was not just cool, in the sense that it had not been heated, but actively cold, as if it had been surrounded by ice. I hefted the rod in my hand.\n\n\"Any more failures like this, Mr Angier,\" Tesla said, in a friendly enough voice, \"and I might be obliged to give you that as a souvenir\".\n\n\"I shall take it,\" I replied. \"Although I should prefer to take with me what I came here to buy\".\n\n\"Given enough time I shall move the Earth\".\n\n\"Time is what I do not have much of,\" I riposted, tossing the rod to the floor. \"And it is not the Earth I wish to move. Nor is it this metal stick\".\n\n\"Then name your preferred object,\" Tesla said, with sarcasm. \"I shall concentrate on that instead\".\n\n\"Mr Tesla,\" I said, \"I wish it to transmit a living body! A man\"!\n\n\"So you wish me to demonstrate my failures not on an iron rod, but on a human being? Whom do you nominate for this dangerous experiment\"?\n\n\"Why should it be dangerous\"? I said.\n\n\"Because all experiment is risky\".\n\n\"I am the one who will be using this\".\n\n\"You wish to submit yourself! Sir, I shall require the remainder of your money before I start experimenting on you\"!\n\n\"It is time for me to leave,\" I said, and turned away, feeling angry. I pushed past him and Alley, and made it to the outside. There was no sign of Randy Gilpin but I strode off anyway, determined if necessary to walk the whole way down to the town.\n\n\"Mr Angier, sir\"! Tesla was standing at the door to his laboratory. \"Let us not exchange hasty words. I should have explained properly to you. If I had known that you wished to transmit living organisms, you would not have presented me with such a challenge. It is difficult to deal with massy, inorganic compounds. Living tissue is not of the same order of problem\".\n\n\"What are you saying, Professor\"? I asked.\n\n\"If you wish me to transmit an organism, please return here tomorrow. It shall be done\".\n\nI nodded my confirmation then continued on my way, stepping on the loose gravel of the path that descended the mountainside.\n\nWhen I had walked about half a mile, my attention was caught by a flash of colour in the long grass beside the track, and I stopped to investigate. It was a short iron rod, painted orange, apparently identical to the one Tesla had been using. Thinking I might after all keep a souvenir of this extraordinary meeting with Tesla, I picked it up, and I have it with me now.\n\n19th August 1900.\n\nToday, when I came to the laboratory, Tesla said, \"I fear I am about to let you down. Much work remains, and I know how pressing is your return to Britain\".\n\n\"What has occurred\"? I asked.\n\n\"I believed it would be a simple matter with life organisms. The structure is so much simpler than that of the elements. Life already contains minute amounts of electricity. I was working on the assumption that all I had to do was boost that energy. I do not know why this has not worked! The computations were exact. Come and see the evidence for yourself\".\n\nInside the laboratory, I noticed Mr Alley who stood with his arms folded protectively. Beside him on the bench was a small wooden cage, containing a little black cat with white whiskers and paws, presently asleep.\n\n\"I hope you will not allow this, Mr Angier\"! Alley cried. \"I brought my children's cat on the firm promise that it would not be harmed. Mr Tesla insists that we submit the creature to an experiment that will undoubtedly kill it\"!\n\nHe led me to the apparatus, which I immediately saw had been entirely rebuilt overnight.\n\n\"What's going wrong\"? I said to Tesla. \"Yesterday you sounded so sure\".\n\n\"I have calculated and recalculated a dozen times. Alley has checked the mathematics too. It is an inexplicable dichotomy between theoretical and actual results. Such a thing has never happened to me before\".\n\n\"May I see the calculations\"? I said.\n\n\"Of course you may, but if you are not a mathematician I fear they will not convey much to you\".\n\nHe and Alley produced a great book in which his computations had been carried out, and together we studied them for a long time. Tesla showed me, as best I was able to understand, the principle behind them, and the calculated results. I took the calculations for granted and concentrated on the results, and then an unexpected glimmering of sense shone through.\n\n\"You say that this determines the distance\"? I said.\n\n\"That is a variable. For purposes of experimentation I have been using a value of one hundred metres, but such a distance is academic, since, as you see, nothing I try to transmit travels any distance at all\".\n\n\"And this value here\"? I said, pointing at another line.\n\n\"The angle. I have been using compass points. It will direct in any of three hundred and sixty degrees from the apex of the energy vortex\".\n\n\"Do you have a setting for elevation\"? I asked.\n\n\"I am not using it. Until the apparatus is fully working, I am merely aiming into the clear air to the east of the laboratory. One must be careful not to cause a rematerialization in a position already occupied by another mass! Something terrible might happen\".\n\nSuddenly I was struck by inspiration! I dashed out of the laboratory and stared from the doorway to the east. When I returned to the laboratory, I went straight to my portmanteau and pulled out the iron rod I had found beside the path yesterday evening. I held it up for Tesla to see.\n\n\"Your experimental object, I do believe\"? I said.\n\n\"Yes it is\".\n\nI told him where I had found it, and when. He hurried across to the apparatus where its twin was lying. He held the two together, and Alley and I stood with him, marveling at their identical appearance.\n\n\"These marks, Mr Angier\"! Tesla breathed in awe, lightly fingering a crisscross patch neatly etched into the metal. \"I made them so that I might prove by identification that this object had been transmitted through the aether. But-\"\n\n\"It has made a facsimile of itself\"! Alley said.\n\n\"Where did you say you found this, sir\"? Tesla demanded.\n\nI led the two men outside and explained, pointing down the mountain. Tesla stared in silent thought.\n\nThen he said, \"I need to see the actual place! Show me\"! To Alley he said, \"Bring the theodolite, and some measuring tape! As soon as you can\"!\n\nAnd with that he set off down the path, clutching me by my upper arm, imploring me to show him the exact location of the find.\n\nI eventually came to the place where I found the rod. It was exactly to the east of the laboratory. Tesla was evidently satisfied, and he was deep in thought as we walked back up the mountain to his laboratory.\n\nI too had been thinking, and as soon as we were inside once more I said, \"Since you are able to calibrate the device, rather than simply aim your experiments into the air to the east of us, could you not send them a shorter distance? Perhaps across the laboratory itself, or outside to the area surrounding the building\"?\n\n\"We evidently think alike, Mr Angier\"!\n\nI had never seen Tesla so cheerful, and he and Alley set to work immediately. I went to sit silently at the rear of the laboratory.\n\nAfter a longer period than I can describe here, Tesla finally said, \"Mr Angier, I believe we are ready\".\n\nWhen he inserted the experimental rod, and manipulated his lever, a most satisfactory bang signaled successful completion of the experiment. The three of us rushed outside, and sure enough, there on the grass, was the familiar orange-painted iron rod.\n\nBack in the laboratory, we all examined the \"original\" piece. Stone cold it was, but undoubtedly identical to the twin that had been made of it across the emptiness of space.\n\n\"Tomorrow, sir,\" Tesla said to me, \"tomorrow, and with the consent of my noble assistant here, we shall try to safely transport the cat from one place to another. If that can be achieved, I take it you will be satisfied\"?\n\n\"Indeed, Mr Tesla,\" I said warmly. \"Indeed\".\n\n20th August 1900.\n\nAnd indeed it has been done. The cat has crossed the aether unharmed!\n\nThere was a small hitch, however, but Tesla promises me another demonstration tomorrow, and this time he has told me there will be no more problems.\n\n11th October 1900.\n\nCaldlow House, Derbyshire\n\nI did not expect to live to write these words. Following the accidental death of my elder brother Henry, I have finally come to the title and lands of my father.\n\nI am now permanently in residence in the family home, and have abandoned my career as a stage illusionist. My daily routine is occupied with the administration of the estate.\n\nI now sign myself,\n\nRupert, 14th Earl of Colderdale.\n\n12th November 1900.\n\nI have just returned from a visit of a few days to my old house in London. My intention had been to clear out the place, and my former workshop, and sell both properties on the open market. The Caldlow estate is on the verge of bankruptcy and I am in a hurry to raise some cash for urgent repairs to both the house and some of the estate buildings. Naturally, I have been cursing myself for wasting practically all the accumulated wealth from my stage career on Tesla. On leaving Colorado, as I returned to England in haste on the news of Henry's death, I gave him the rest of the fee. It did not occur to me then how radically my whole life was to be changed by the news.\n\nReturning to Idmiston Villas had an unanticipated effect on me, though. I found it full of memories, of course, and these were as mixed as all such memories can be, but above all, I was reminded of my first days in London. Then I was hardly more than a boy, then I met Julia.\n\nI finally sent a note to Julia's address. Rather to my surprise, but to my intense pleasure, she consented to meet me, and two days ago, I spent an afternoon with her and the children at the house of one of her women friends.\n\nJulia, at first cool and remote, was obviously much affected by my expressions of shock and emotion (Edward, sixteen now, is so tall and good-looking; Lydia and Florence are so beautiful and gentle; I could not keep my eyes off them all afternoon!) and soon she was speaking kindly and warmly to me.\n\nI then told her my news. Even when we were married and living together I had never revealed my past to her, so what I had to say to her was a triple surprise. Firstly, I had to tell her that I had once left a family and estate of which she had never heard, secondly, that I had now returned to it, and thirdly, that I had decided to abandon my stage career.\n\nJulia took all this calmly. A little later, she asked me if I was sure, I should abandon my career. I said I saw no alternative. She told me that although we were separated she had continued to follow my magic career with admiration, regretting only that she were no longer a part of it.\n\nAs we spoke, I felt rising in me, or more correctly sinking out of me, a despair that I had thrown away my wife, and more unforgivably my splendid children, for the sake of the American woman.\n\nYesterday, before leaving London, I met with Julia a second time. This time the children were not with her.\n\nI begged her forgiveness for all the sins I had committed against her. I pleaded with her to return to me, and live with me once more as my wife.\n\nShe said no, but promised that she would consider carefully. I deserve no better.\n\nLater in the day, I caught the overnight train to Sheffield. I thought of nothing but reconciliation with Julia.\n\n17th November 1900.\n\nJulia has put to me a proposition about a way we could possibly be together in the future. I have to make a simple decision.\n\nShe says she will return to me, live with me once more as my wife, but only if I resume my magic career. She wishes me to leave Caldlow House and return to Idmiston Villas. She says that she and the children do not wish to move to a house in a remote and, to them, unknown part of Derbyshire.\n\nTo try to persuade me that her proposal is also for my own good, she adds four arguments.\n\nFirst, she says the stage is in her blood as much as mine and she would wish to participate wholly in all my future stage activities.\n\nAt the beginning of this year, she next argues, I was at the peak of my profession, but that by default the wretched Borden is taking my laurels. Apparently, he is continuing to perform his version of the switch illusion.\n\nJulia then reminds me that the only reliable way I know of earning money is to perform magic, and that I have a duty to go on supporting her as well as running the family estate she has never seen and had never heard of until last week.\n\nFinally, she points out that I will not lose my inheritance by continuing to work in London and the house and everything that goes with the estate will still be waiting for me when the time comes for retirement. Urgent matters, such as repairs, can be managed from London almost as easily as from the house.\n\nSo I have returned to Derbyshire, because I need some time alone to think.\n\n21st November 1900.\n\nI am at Idmiston Villas, and I have found here a letter from Alley, the assistant to Nikola Tesla. I now transcribe it:\n\nSeptember 27, 1900.\n\nMr Angier, Sir:\n\nI don't expect you have heard but Nikola Tesla has left Colorado already, and is probably now in New York or New Jersey. His laboratory here has been seized by his creditors, and it is currently looking for a purchaser.\n\nHowever, in some matters, Mr Tesla is a man of honor, and before our work here was completed, your equipment was as instructed shipped to your workshop.\n\nOnce the apparatus has been correctly put together (I wrote the assembly instructions myself) you will find it is in complete working order, and operates exactly to the agreed technical specification. The device is self-regulating, and should continue to work without adjustment or repair for many years. All you should do is keep it clean and brighten the electrical contact points if they become dull. (Mr Tesla enclosed a set of spares for those parts, which will, in the ordinary course, require replacement.)\n\nI would of course be fascinated to learn what illusions you work with this extraordinary invention, because I am one of your greatest admirers.\n\nLet me say in conclusion, Sir, that I was honored to play some part, no matter how small, in building this apparatus for you.\n\nYours most sincerely, Fare ham K. Alley, Dip. Eng.\n\nAs soon as I read this, I hurried around to my workshop. I enquired of my neighbours there if a large package had been delivered from the USA, but they knew nothing of it.\n\n22nd November 1900.\n\nI showed Alley's letter to Julia this morning, quite forgetting that I had not yet told her about my most recent trip to the USA, and what I had done there.\n\n\"So this is where all your money has gone\"? she said.\n\n\"Yes\".\n\n\"What is so special about the illusion\"? she asked.\n\n\"Not the illusion itself,\" I replied. \"It is the means by which it is achieved\".\n\n\"Is Mr Borden something to do with this\"?\n\n\"You have not forgotten Mr Borden, I see\".\n\n\"My dear, it was Alfred Borden who separated us. I have had many years to reflect, and I trace everything that went wrong back to that day when he attacked me\". She spoke in quiet rage and without any trace of self-pity. \"If he had not hurt me I should not have lost our first child. Your restlessness began then. Even the dear children who followed could not compensate for the cruelty and stupidity of what Borden did that day, and that the feud between you continues is proof of the outrage you too must still feel\".\n\n\"I have never spoken to you about that,\" I said. \"How do you know\"?\n\n\"Because I am not a fool, Rupert, and I have seen occasional remarks in the magic magazines\". I had not known she continued to subscribe to those. \"You are still prime amongst my concerns,\" she said. \"I wonder only why you have never spoken to me of his attacks\".\n\n\"Because I am, I suppose, a little ashamed of the feud\".\n\n\"Surely he is the aggressor\"?\n\n\"I have had to defend myself,\" I said.\n\nI told her about my investigations into his past, and my attempts to discover how he worked the illusion. Then I described the hopes I had for Tesla's equipment.\n\nJulia was the perfect audience for my enthusiasms about Tesla's device, and for the next hour or more, we discussed all the possibilities it presented to me.\n\nFinally, Julia said, \"Why do we not begin our enquiries with the Post Office\"? So it was, two hours later, that we located two immense crates addressed to me, waiting safely in the dead-letter section of the Mount Pleasant Sorting Office.\n\n15th December 1900.\n\nThe Tesla apparatus has been erected in my workshop ever since I picked it up from Mount Pleasant. I have been rehearsing.\n\nThe apparatus is in full working order, and has been ingeniously designed to work on all presently known versions of electrical supply. This means I may travel with my show, even to Europe, the USA and (Alley claims in his instructions) the Far East.\n\nHowever, I cannot perform my show unless the theatre has electrical current supplied. In future, I will have to check this before I accept any new bookings.\n\nAll stage illusions are given names by their inventors, and it is by these that they become known in the profession. After some thought I have decided to call the Tesla invention In a Flash, and by this it will become known.\n\nI also use this entry to note that as of last Monday, 10th December, Julia and the children have returned and are living with me at Idmiston Villas. They will see Caldlow House for the first time when we spend the Christmas holiday there.\n\n31st December 1900.\n\nI write these words as the nineteenth century draws to a close. In an hour from now, I shall descend to our drawing room, where Julia and the children are waiting for me, and together we shall see in the New Year and the New Century.\n\nBecause secrecy again has a hold on me, I must say that what Hutton and I did earlier this evening had to be done.\n\nThis evening, soon after nightfall, I told Julia what I was about to do, and left her waiting in her sitting room.\n\nI found Hutton, and we left the house and went together across the East Lawn towards the family vault. We transported the prestige materials on a handcart sometimes used by the gardeners.\n\nHutton and I had only storm lanterns to guide us. As the wooden portal swung open, Hutton declared his unease. I felt terrific sympathy for him.\n\nI said, \"Hutton, I don't expect you to go through with this. You may wait for me here if you like. Or you could return to the house, and I'll continue alone\".\n\n\"No, my Lord,\" he replied in his honest way. \"I have agreed to this\".\n\nLeaving the cart by the entrance, we ventured inside. The inner door was unlocked, but it was stiff and heavy to move aside.\n\nHutton spoke beside me:\n\n\"Sir, should I collect the prestige materials\"?\n\nI could just make out his features in the lantern's glow.\n\n\"Yes, I think so. Do you need me to help you\"?\n\n\"If you would wait at the bottom of the steps, sir\".\n\nHe walked quickly up the flight of steps, and I knew he wanted to be done as soon as possible.\n\nHere in this place were most of my forebears, lying in boxes and shrouds.\n\nI was torn by my fears. I wanted to follow Hutton up to the outside air, yet I knew I had to plunge further on into the depths of the vault. I am a rational man who seeks explanations and welcomes the scientific method, yet for those few seconds Hutton was away from me I was tormented by the easy rush of the illogical.\n\nThen at last, I heard him again on the steps, dragging the first of the large sacks containing the prestige materials. I had to put down my lantern while we got the sack through the door, and because Hutton had left his own light with the handcart, we were working in almost total darkness.\n\nI said to him, \"I'm profoundly glad you are here to help me, Hutton\".\n\n\"I realize that, my Lord. I should not have cared to do this myself alone\".\n\n\"Then let us complete it quickly\".\n\nThis time we went back to the handcart together, and dragged down the second large sack.\n\n\"We'll leave the sacks here,\" I said. \"As far off the floor as possible. I'll come down here again tomorrow, when it's daylight. With a better torch\".\n\n\"I completely understand, sir\".\n\nWithout saying another word between us, we returned quickly to the surface, and pushed the outer door closed behind us. I shuddered.\n\nIn the cold air of the night-time garden, Hutton and I shook hands.\n\n\"Thank you for helping me, Hutton,\" I said. \"I had no idea that it would be like that down there\".\n\n\"Nor I, my Lord. Will you be requiring anything else from me this evening\"?\n\nI considered.\n\n\"Would you and your wife care to join myself and Lady Colderdale at midnight? We plan to see in the New Year\".\n\n\"Thank you, sir. We shall be honoured to do so\".\n\nAnd that was how our expedition ended. Hutton dragged the handcart away towards the garden shed, and I crossed the East Lawn then walked around the periphery of the house to the main entrance. I came directly to this room, to write my account while events were still fresh.\n\nNow this account has been written, and it is close to midnight. It is time for me to seek out my family and household for the simple and familiar ceremony that celebrates the end of one year and, in this case, one century, then welcomes in the next.\n\n1st January 1901.\n\nI have been back to the vault, and moved the prestige materials to a better position.\n\n15th January 1901.\n\nIdmiston Villas\n\nYesterday, the Tesla apparatus arrived back from Derbyshire, and with Adam Wilson's assistance, I immediately unpacked it and erected it. According to my clock, it took under fifteen minutes. We must be able to be sure of doing it within ten minutes, when working in a theatre. Mr Alley's sheet of instructions declares that when he and Tesla were testing its portability they were able to erect the whole thing in under twelve minutes.\n\nAdam Wilson knows the secret of the illusion, as he must. Adam has been working for me for more than five years, and I believe I can trust him. To be as sure as reasonably possible I have offered him a confidentiality bonus of ten pounds, to be paid into an accumulating fund in his name after each successful performance. He and Gertrude are expecting their second child.\n\n14th February 1901.\n\nI rehearsed In a Flash twice yesterday, and will do so twice again tomorrow. I dare not make it any more than that. I shall be performing it on Saturday evening at the Trocadero in Holloway Road, then at least once again in the week following. I believe that if I can perform it regularly enough, then extra rehearsals should not be necessary.\n\nTesla warned me that there would be aftereffects, and these are indeed profound. It is no trivial matter to use the apparatus. Each time I pass through it, I suffer.\n\nIn the first place, there is the physical pain. My body is torn apart, disassembled. In a fraction of a second, my body is converted into electrical waves. It is radiated through space. It is reassembled at its designated target.\n\nSlam! I am broken apart! Slam! I am together again!\n\nIt is a violent shock that explodes in every part of me, in every direction. A millionth of a second of total agony! That is how it feels.\n\nYet I arrive in the selected place, and I am exactly as I was that millionth of a second earlier. I am whole in myself, and identical to myself, but I am in the shock of acute pain.\n\nThe first time I used the Tesla apparatus, in the basement of Caldlow House, with no warning of what I was to experience, I collapsed to the floor in the belief that I had died. It did not seem possible that my heart, my brain, could survive such an explosion of pain. I had no thoughts, no emotional reactions. It felt as if I had died, and I acted as if I had died.\n\nAs I slumped to the floor, Julia, who of course was there with me for the test, ran to my side. My first lucid memory in the post-death world is of her gentle hands reaching into my shirt to feel for a sign of life. I opened my eyes, in shock and amazement, happy beyond words to find her beside me, to feel her tenderness. Quickly I was able to stand, to reassure her that I was well, to hold her and kiss her, to be myself once more.\n\nIn truth, then, physical recovery from this brutal experience is itself speedy, but the mental consequences are formidable.\n\nOn the day of that first test in Derbyshire, I forced myself to repeat the test in the afternoon, but as a result, I was cast into the darkest gloom for much of the Christmas period. I had died twice. I had become one of the walking dead, a damned soul.\n\nAnd the reminders of what I did then are the materials that later had to be put away. I could not even face that gruesome task until New Year's Eve, as I have described.\n\nYesterday, here in London, in the electrical brightness and familiarity of my workshop, with the Tesla equipment reassembled, I felt I should undergo two more rehearsals. I am a performer, a professional. I must give a glamour to what I do. I must appear to be a magician who has successfully performed the impossible.\n\nI must, by careful art, make my miracle less miraculous. I must emerge from the elemental transmitter as if I have not been slammed apart, and slammed together again.\n\nSo I have been trying to learn how to prepare for the pain, how to react to it without keeling over, how to step forward with my arms raised and with a flashing smile to bow and acknowledge applause.\n\n17th February 1901.\n\nLast night I safely crossed the aether from the stage of the Trocadero to the royal box. The equipment worked perfectly.\n\nI was able to disguise completely the shock of the impact on me. I can say that practice with the apparatus has meant the terrible shock is not nearly as terrible as before, and that it has been getting slightly better each time I try it. I can foresee that in a month or so I will be able to bear the effect with outward indifference.\n\nI also note that the consequent gloom I suffer is much less than after my first attempts.\n\n2nd March 1901.\n\nIn London.\n\nI have an unprecedented thirty-five confirmed bookings in my appointments diary, accepted for the period of the next four months. Three of these are for shows in my own stage name, and one of these is to be called The Great Danton Entertains.\n\nI shall be roaming the country. Brighton, Exeter, Kidderminster, Portsmouth, Ayr, Folkestone, Manchester, Sheffield, Aberystwyth, York, all these and many more will greet me on my first tour, as well as the capital itself, where I have several dates.\n\nThe agent is already speaking of foreign tours, with perhaps yet another trip to the USA.\n\n10th July 1901.\n\nI have been continually revising and rehearsing In a Flash for some months, and it is now more or less a perfected skill. All my earlier hopes for it have come true. I can pass through the aether without registering any reaction to the physical traumas I endure. The transition is smooth, and from the point of view of the audience impossible to explain.\n\nThe mental aftereffects are not a problem anymore. I suffer no agonies of depression, or self-doubt. To the contrary (and I confide this to no one, and record it in no other document than in this secret and lockable diary), the wrenching apart of my body has become a pleasure to which I am almost addicted. At first, I was disheartened by the imaginings of death, of living in an afterlife, but now I nightly experience my transmission as a rebirth, a renewal of self. In the early days I was concerned by the many times I should have to perform the trick to keep in practice, but now as soon as I have completed one performance I begin to crave the next.\n\nThree weeks ago, during a temporary break in my round of engagements, I erected the Tesla equipment in my workshop and put myself through the process. Not to try out new performance techniques, not to perfect existing ones, but purely for the physical pleasure of the experience.\n\nDisposal of the prestige materials produced at each show is still a problem, but after all these weeks, we have developed a few routines so that the job is done with a minimum of fuss.\n\n3rd September 1902.\n\nIn London.\n\nA momentous revelation!\n\nEarly yesterday evening, while I was resting between shows at Daly's Theatre in Islington, a man called at the stage door to see me. When I saw his card, I asked for him to be shown immediately to my dressing room. It was Mr Arthur Koenig, the young journalist from the Evening Star who had given me so much food for thought about Borden. I was not surprised to learn that Mr Koenig now has the position of Deputy News Editor of that paper. He entered cordially and shook my hand.\n\n\"I just saw your matinee, Mr Danton\"! he said. \"My hearty congratulations to you. I confess myself baffled and entertained in equal measure\".\n\n\"I'm glad to hear it,\" I said, and told my dresser to pour Mr Koenig a small glass of whisky. When this was done, I asked my dresser to leave us alone together, and to return in fifteen minutes.\n\n\"Your good health, sir\"! Koenig announced, raising his glass. \"Or should I say, my Lord\"?\n\nI stared at him in surprise.\n\n\"How the devil do you know about that\"?\n\n\"Why do you think I should not? The news of your brother's death reached the press in the usual way, and was duly reported\".\n\n\"I've seen those reports,\" I replied. 'None of them mentioned me\".\n\n\"I think it might be because few in Fleet Street know you by more than your stage name. As a true admirer, I connected you to Henry Angier\".\n\n\"Nothing escapes you, does it\"? I said.\n\n\"Not that kind of information, sir. Don't worry, your secret is safe with me. I assume it is a secret\"?\n\n\"I have always kept the two parts of my life separate. In that sense, it is a secret and I'd be glad if you would treat it as such\".\n\n\"You have my word, my Lord\".\n\n\"May I ask,\" I said eventually, \"to what I owe the pleasure of this visit\"?\n\n\"I've come to apologize in the matter of Mr Borden, your rival. I confess that all my elaborate theories about him were in error, while your theory, blunt and simple, was correct\".\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" I said.\n\n\"When I came to see you before, I held some theory of Mr Borden performing a greater magic than any that had existed before\".\n\n\"I remember,\" I said. \"You wisely convinced me of it. I was grateful to you-\"\n\n\"You, however, had a plainer explanation. Borden is not one man but two, you said. Twins, you said. Identical twin brothers, each taking the place of the other as required\".\n\n\"But you proved-\"\n\n\"You were right, sir! Mr Borden's act is indeed based on twins. Alfred Borden is a name conflated from two: Albert and Frederick, twin brothers, who perform together as one\".\n\n\"That's not true\"! I said.\n\n\"But it was your own theory\".\n\n\"You swiftly disabused me. You had evidence-\"\n\n\"Much of which turns out to have been falsified. I was a young reporter, not then fully practised in my profession. I have since learnt to check facts, to double-check them, then to check them once more\".\n\n\"But I went into the matter myself,\" I said. \"I examined the hospital records of his birth, the register of the school he attended.\"\n\n\"Falsified documents, Mr Angier. The Bordens have built their lives around sustaining this illusion. Nothing about them can be trusted\".\n\n\"I investigated most carefully,\" I insisted. \"I knew there were two brothers with those names, but one is two years younger than the other\"!\n\n\"Both coincidentally born in May, as I recall. It does not take much forgery to change a birth record from 8th May 1856 to 18th May 1858\".\n\n\"There was a photograph of the two brothers, taken together\"!\n\n\"Yes, and one so easy to find! It was left as a red herring for such as you and me to stumble across. As we did\".\n\n\"But the two brothers were clearly unalike. I saw the portrait myself\"!\n\n\"And so did I. Indeed, I have a copy of it in my office. The distinction between their facial characteristics is remarkable. But surely you understand the deceptive use of stage make-up\".\n\nI was thunderstruck by the news, and stared at the floor, unable to think coherently.\n\n\"Are you sure of this\"? I demanded. \"Totally sure\"? Koenig was nodding slowly. \"For instance, have you ever seen the two brothers together\"?\n\n\"This is the basis of my certainty. Just once, and then only briefly, they met in my presence\".\n\n\"Were you following them\"?\n\n\"I was following one of them,\" Koenig corrected me. \"I followed Mr Borden from his house one evening in August. He walked alone into Regents Park. I was following at a distance of about a hundred yards. As he walked round the Inner Circle, a man approached him from the opposite direction. As they met, they paused for about three seconds and spoke together. Then they walked on as before. Now, though, Borden was carrying a small leather case. The man he had spoken to soon passed me, and as he did so I could see that he looked exactly like Borden\".\n\nI stared at Koenig thoughtfully.\n\n\"How do you know that the man, who walked on, the one now carrying the case, was not the man who had spoken to Borden? He could simply have walked back the way he had come. And if that was so, wouldn't it have been the Borden you had been following who passed you\"?\n\n\"I know what I saw, my Lord. They were wearing different clothes, perhaps for reasons of a clever trick, but this fact made it possible for me to distinguish between them. They met, they passed on, they were identical\".\n\nMy mind was focused. I was thinking rapidly about the mechanics of mounting a theatrical magic performance. If it were true that they were twins then both brothers would have to be present in the theatre at each show. This would mean that the backstage staff would inevitably know the secret. I already knew that Borden did not box the stage, and there are always people hanging around in the wings during a show, seeing too much. If Borden's act was based on identical twins, then surely the secret would have leaked out years ago?\n\nOtherwise, what was the explanation? It could only be that the secrecy was maintained before and after the show. That Borden-1, so to speak, would arrive at the theatre with his apparatus and props, with Borden-2 already concealed in one of the pieces. Borden-2 would make his appearance during the performance, while Borden-1 went into hiding in the props on-stage.\n\nIt was possible, and if that was all, there was to it I might be able to accept it. But Borden must have a team working with him: an ingenieur of course, one or more assistants who appeared on stage, several carriers and shifters, an agent. If all these people were privy to his secret then their ability to keep quiet about it was remarkable.\n\nOn the other hand, and much more likely in view of human nature, if they were not to be trusted, Borden-1 and Borden-2 would have to engage in concealment.\n\nBeyond this, there were the day-to-day realities of theatrical life. For example, on the days when there was a matinee performance, what would Borden-2 (the one concealed in the apparatus) do between shows? Would he remain hidden while his brother relaxed in the green room with the other artistes? Would he let himself out secretly, then skulk alone in the dressing room until it was time for the next show?\n\nHow did the two of them get into and out of the theatres without being spotted? Stage door managers are jealous guardians of the way. There are always alternative ways into the building, through the scenery bay or front of house, but again this suggests a need for constant secrecy and preparation, and a willingness to put up with not inconsiderable discomfort.\n\n\"I see I have given you something to think about,\" Koenig said, interrupting my train of thought.\n\n\"You're sure of your facts this time\"? I said.\n\n\"Yes, sir. Upon my very word\".\n\nI stood up, to indicate that the interview was at an end.\n\nKoenig picked up his hat and coat, and went to the door, which I held open for him.\n\nI said to him, as casually as I could, \"You show no curiosity about how I perform my own illusion\".\n\n\"I take it that it's magic, sir\".\n\n\"You don't then suspect me of having an identical twin\"?\n\n\"I know you have not\".\n\n\"So you investigated me,\" I said. \"And what about Borden? Is he wondering how I work the effect\"?\n\nMr Koenig gave me a broad wink.\n\n\"I'm sure he and his brother would not like you to know that they burn with curiosity about you, sir\". He extended his hand, and we shook. \"Once again, my congratulations. If I may say so, it has been reassuring to see you in such good health\".\n\nHe was gone before I could respond to that, but I think I know what he meant.\n\n7th September 1902.\n\nIt already seems that I shall be busily engaged from the middle of October until March or April next year. My estimated income from these performances will make me rich beyond the wildest dreams of my youth. By the end of next year I shall, in all probability, need never work again.\n\nWhich brings me to an explanation of Koenig's parting remark.\n\nA few months ago, when I was in the first rush of perfecting the presentation of In a Flash, I thought of a new final twist to the illusion. I arranged, by a combination of carefully positioned lights and use of make-up, that at the end of my act, after I had passed through the aether, I would look exhausted. I would seem worn by the magical transformation. I would be a man who had flirted with death, and who now showed the unmistakable traces.\n\nThis effect has become a routine part of my act. Throughout my show, I move carefully, I turn with a slight stiffness of the waist and back, I walk with my shoulders hunched. As the final curtain falls I appear to most of the audience as if, I am not long for this world.\n\nApart from the effect itself, I have a long-term strategy in mind. I am planning and preparing for my own death. Next year I wish to retire from the stage for good. I want to be free of the endless touring, of the long journeys, the overnight stays in theatrical lodgings. I am sick of the need for secrecy about what I do, and I always fear another round of attacks from Borden.\n\nMost of all, my children are growing up and I wish to be with them as they do so. Edward is soon to depart to university, and the girls will no doubt be married soon.\n\nBy this time next year, I shall be, as I say, financially independent, and with prudent investment, the Caldlow estate should be able to provide for my family for the rest of my life and theirs. The life of The Great Danton, of Rupert Angier, shall come to a cancerous end, brought on by the rigours of his career, at some point in the autumn of 1903.\n\nMeanwhile, without publicity or announcement, the 14th Earl of Colderdale will at much the same time take up the reins of his inheritance.\n\nThus the explanation of Koenig's remark about my \"surprising\" good health. He is a sharp man, who knows more about me than I wish he did.\n\nI have been reflecting a great deal about his theory that there is not one Borden but two. I remain unsure.\n\nThis is because of the endless complications of living with the deception. What about everyday life? No artiste is constantly in work, however successful his or her career. There are periods of rest, both voluntary and involuntary. There are necessary delays between bookings. There are holidays, illnesses, family crises.\n\nIf Borden is not one man but two, and one of the men is always in hiding so that the other might seem to be the \"only\" Alfred Borden, where and how is the hiding going on? What happens in the life of the hidden man while he is hiding? How does he make contact with his brother? Do they ever meet, and if so how do they arrange not to be spotted by anyone?\n\nHow many other people know about the deception, and how can Borden be certain the secret is safe with them?\n\nSpeaking in particular of other people, what of Borden's wife? And what of his children?\n\nIf Borden is two men, they cannot both be husband to the wife, nor both be father to the children. Which of them is husband, which the father? Borden's wife is a woman of good background and by all accounts no fool. What does she in fact know about Borden?\n\nIs she being kept in the dark about his true identity? Would she suspect nothing, discern no difference at all between the two men?\n\nWhat about private jokes and observations, shared personal memories, matters of physical intimacy? Is it conceivable that the two men would collaborate to such an extent that even personal matters are dragged into the precautions and secrecy that surround a mere stage illusion?\n\nThe contrary is harder to believe: that Borden's wife knows the truth of the matter and is prepared for some reason to put up with it. It is a situation full of instability.\n\nBoth of these explanations are so unlikely that I am forced to believe in a third. The Borden brothers have deliberately not told the wife the truth, and have tried to deceive her, but she has herself made the deception unimportant. In other words, she has worked out what is going on (how could she not?), but for reasons of her own has decided to agree with it.\n\nIn spite of the fact that this theory contains its own mysteries, I find it the most reasonable explanation, but even so, the whole business is unbelievable.\n\nI would go to considerable lengths to protect my secrets, but I would not let secrecy become an obsession. Could Borden, and Borden's supposed brother, be as obsessive as Koenig makes them out to be?\n\nI am still in two minds about this!\n\nIn the end it does not matter, for a trick is a trick and everyone who sees it knows that a deception is being performed. But Julia suffered horribly because of the feud, and my own life came damnably close to its end because of it. I believe Borden is such a man as to make a fetish of his secrets and it was my misfortune to tangle with him.\n\nAlso my luck, as a direct consequence of the feud, to think of the illusion that is making my fortune!\n\n30th April 1903.\n\nI have told Unwin to continue accepting bookings through to the end of the year, and for the early months of 1904. However, I shall be dead by the end of September. Probably it will occur on Saturday, 19th September.\n\n20th May 1903.\n\nI have cancelled both my performances tonight, tomorrow's are at risk, and as I draft these words, I am anxiously awaiting Julia's arrival.\n\nI am a fool, a damned, bloody fool!\n\nLast night, my second performance was halfway through. I have recently added a new card trick to my repertoire. In this, a member of the audience is invited up to the stage. He takes a card and writes his name on the face of it. I tear off a corner of the card, and give it to the volunteer to hold. The rest of the card is placed inside a paper envelope, which is ignited. When the flames have gone out, I produce a large orange. I cut it in half and it is found to contain the signed card, and the torn-off corner still of course fits.\n\nLast night my volunteer was what I thought must be a local man; he was tall and strong, had a florid complexion, and when he spoke I heard a Suffolk accent. He was sitting in the centre of the front row and he offered himself as soon as I called for someone to come up on stage. That should have alerted me to likely trouble. However, I began doing the trick.\n\nHow could I not have guessed it was Borden?! He even gave me a clue, because the name he wrote on the playing card was Alf Redbone, a transparent near-anagram, yet in my preoccupations, I took it to be his real name.\n\nWith the card trick completed, I shook his hand, thanked him by name, and added my applause to that of the audience as he was led by Hester, my present female assistant, towards the stalls ramp.\n\nI did not notice that Redbone's seat was still empty a few minutes later, as I moved towards the start of In a Flash.\n\nI noticed his absence when it was too late; the apparatus was in operation and I had to complete the trick.\n\nAt this point in the show, nothing can be modified. Even my chosen target area is fixed; setting the coordinates is too intricate and time-consuming to be done at any time other than before a performance. The previous night I had set the apparatus for both of yesterday's performances so that I would arrive in the highest loge at stage left, which by arrangement with the management was kept empty for both shows. The loge was at the same approximate height as the main balcony, and could be seen from almost every other part of the auditorium.\n\nI had arranged it so that I should materialize on the very rail of the box itself, facing down into the stalls a long way below, apparently struggling to keep my balance. Everything had gone exactly to plan during the first performance, and my magical transformation brought shouts of alarm from the audience, followed by thunderous applause as I swung down to the stage on the rope thrown up to me by Hester.\n\nTo arrive on the rail of the loge facing down to the audience, I have to stand inside the Tesla apparatus with my back towards the loge. The audience cannot know it, of course, but the position in which I arrange my body is exactly recreated at the instant of arrival. From my place inside the apparatus I could not therefore see where I was about to arrive.\n\nWith Borden somewhere around, a terrible certainty struck me that he was about to sabotage me yet again! What if he was lurking inside the loge, and gave me a shove as I arrived on the ledge? I felt the electrical tension mounting ineluctably around me. I could not prevent myself turning anxiously around to look up at the box. I could just make it out through the deadly blue-white electrical sparks. All seemed well; there was nothing there to block my arrival, and although I couldn't see into the box itself, where the seats are placed, it did not look as if anyone was there.\n\nBorden's intent was much more sinister, and a moment later, I found out what it was. In the very instant that I turned to look up at the loge, two things happened simultaneously.\n\nThe first was that the transmission of my body actually began.\n\nThe second was that electrical power to the apparatus cut out, disconnecting the current instantly. The blue fires vanished, the electrical field died.\n\nI remained on the stage, standing within the wooden cage of the apparatus in full view of the audience. I was staring over my shoulder at the loge.\n\nThe transmission had been interrupted! But it had begun before it was stopped, and now I could see an image of myself on the rail; there was my ghost, my double, momentarily frozen in the stance I had adopted when I turned to look, half twisted, half crouching, looking away and up. It was a thin, insubstantial copy of myself, a partial prestige. Even as I looked, this image of myself straightened in alarm, threw out his arms, and collapsed backwards and out of sight into the loge itself!\n\nAppalled at what I had seen I stepped forward out of the coils of the Tesla cage. On cue, the spotlight came on, illuminating the whole loge to pick out my intended materialization. The people in the audience looked up at the loge, already half anticipating the trick. They started to applaud, but the noise faded away to nothing. There was nothing to see.\n\nI stood alone on the stage. My illusion was ruined.\n\n\"Curtain\"! I yelled into the wings. \"Bring down the curtain\"!\n\nAt last, the technician heard me and the curtain came down, separating me from the audience. Hester appeared at a run.\n\n\"What happened\"? she cried.\n\n\"That man who came up from the audience! Where is he\"?\n\n\"I don't know! I thought he went back to his seat\".\n\n\"He got backstage somehow! You are supposed to make sure these people leave the stage\"!\n\nI pushed her aside angrily and lifted up the fabric of the curtain. At a crouch, I stepped beneath it and went forward to the footlights. The house lights were now on, and the audience was moving into the aisles and slowly up to the exits. The people were obviously puzzled, but they were paying no more attention to the stage.\n\nI looked up at the box. The spotlight had been turned off, and I could see nothing.\n\nA woman screamed once, then again. She was somewhere in the building behind the loges.\n\nI walked quickly into the wings and met Wilson as he was hurrying to the stage to find me. I instructed him to dismantle and crate up the apparatus as quickly as possible. I dashed past him and gained access to the stairs to the balcony and loges. Members of the audience were walking down, and as I started up the stairs, weaving between them.\n\nEvery step I took was harder to complete. My breath was rattling in my throat, and I could feel my heart pounding as if I had just run a mile uphill. I have always kept myself fit, and physical exercise has never been much of a strain for me, but suddenly I felt as if I were weak and overweight. By the time, I was at the top of only the first short flight of steps I could go no further. I rested for a few seconds, then launched myself up the next flight of steps.\n\nI had taken no more than two steps when I had a terrifying cough. My heart was hammering, blood was thumping rhythmically in my ears, sweat was bursting from me. I was unable to stay upright, and I slumped forward across the stone steps, while the last few of the theatregoers went past, their boots only inches from my head.\n\nWilson eventually found me. He raised me into his arms, and held me like a child while I struggled to regain my breath.\n\nAt long last my heart and breathing steadied, and a great chill descended on me.\n\nFinally, I managed to say, \"Did you see what happened\"?\n\n\"Alfred Borden must have got backstage, sir\".\n\n\"Not that! I mean what happened when the power failed\"?\n\n\"I was operating the switching board, Mr Angier. As usual\".\n\nWilson's place during In a Flash is at the back of the stage, invisible to the audience because he is concealed by the backcloth of the screening box. Although he is in touch at every moment with what I am doing, he cannot actually see me for most of the illusion.\n\nI described the ghostly prestige of myself that I had briefly seen. Wilson seemed puzzled, but immediately offered to run up to the loge itself. He did so, while I lay helplessly and uncomfortably on the cold bare steps. When he returned a minute or two later Wilson told me he had seen nothing there.\n\nHe said the seats in the top loge had been scattered across the carpeted floor, but otherwise there was nothing unusual about it. I had to accept what he said; I have learned that Wilson is a sharp and reliable assistant.\n\nHe got me back down the stairs and on the stage again. By this time, I had recovered sufficiently that I could stand unsupported.\n\nI had to put the matter out of my mind. Of much, more pressing concern was the fact that I had suddenly become physically incapacitated. Every move was a strain, and the cough felt explosively coiled in my chest, ready to burst out again at any moment.\n\nWilson hired a cab and returned me safely to my hotel, and at once sent a message to Julia. A doctor was summoned, and when he arrived, he examined me and declared he could find nothing amiss. I had great trouble falling asleep, but I did so in the end.\n\nI awoke this morning feeling stronger and walked downstairs unaided. Wilson was waiting for me in the hotel foyer, with the news that Julia would be arriving at noon. Meanwhile, he declared that I looked unwell, but I insisted I had started to recover. After breakfast, though, I realized I had little strength in me.\n\nReluctantly, I have cancelled both of tonight's performances, and while Wilson has been at the theatre, I have penned this account of what happened.\n\n22nd May 1903.\n\nIn London.\n\nAt Julia's urging, and on Wilson's advice, I have cancelled the remainder of the Lowestoft booking.\n\nDeep in my heart, there is a secret fear. In short, it is that my ill health might mean I shall never again be able to perform. After Borden's attack on me, I have become a semi-invalid.\n\nI have been examined by three doctors. All of them pronounce me well and showing no obvious symptoms of illness. I complain about my breathing, so they listen to my chest and prescribe fresh air. I tell them my heart races when I walk up a flight of stairs, and they listen to my heart and they tell me to be careful about what I eat, and to take things easier. I say that I tire easily, and they advise me to rest.\n\nI weighed myself, with an astonishing result. I have lost nearly thirty pounds in weight! I have weighed more or less exactly one hundred and sixty-eight pounds, for most of my adult years. This morning I found that I weigh just over one hundred and thirty-nine pounds!\n\nIn the mirror, I look the same as ever. I look tired, indeed, but I do not look like someone who cannot climb a short flight of stairs without gasping for breath halfway up.\n\nThere is no normal or logical reason for this; it must have been caused by the incomplete Tesla transmission. The electrical information was only partially sent. Borden's interruption prevented full reassembly.\n\nOnce again, his intervention has taken me to the edge of death!\n\nLater.\n\nOn walking, I was seized by an idea, whose consequences I am still thinking through.\n\nIn the confidentiality of these pages let me disclose that whenever I have used the Tesla apparatus, whether it be in performance or rehearsal, I have always made sure to hide two or three gold coins in my pocket. Why I should do so must be self-evident; my recent acquisition of a financial fortune is not solely attributable to performance fees!\n\nTesla, I should in all conscience report, warned me against such an act. He is a highly moral man, and he lectured me long on the subject of forgery. He said he also had scientific reasons, that the apparatus was calibrated for my known body-weight (with certain margins of safety), and that the presence about my person of small but massy objects, such as gold coins, could make the projection inaccurate over longer distances. However, I have never had any of the problems of inaccuracy of which Tesla warned, perhaps because the distances I travel are so short.\n\nThis afternoon I searched for the three coins I had been carrying in my pocket on Tuesday evening. As soon as I held them, I felt certain they weighed less than they did before, and when I weighed them, I discovered they were indeed lighter.\n\nI calculate that they too have lost about seventeen per cent of their mass. They look the same, but they have lost some of their weight.\n\n18th July 1903.\n\nIn Derbyshire.\n\nThe Great Danton is dead. The death of the illusionist Rupert Angier came as a result of injuries sustained when a trick went wrong during a performance at the Pavilion Theatre in Lowestoft. He died at his home in Highgate, London, and leaves a widow and three children.\n\nThe 14th Earl of Colderdale remains alive. He has had the mixed pleasure of reading his own obituary in The Times, a privilege not granted to many.\n\nAngier's affairs are now in the hands of a firm of lawyers. He is of course really dead, and his body was really placed inside the coffin. This I saw as Angier's last illusion: providing his own corpse for burial. Julia is officially his widow, and his children are orphans. They were all present at Highgate Cemetery for his funeral, a ceremony was kept strictly to his immediate family. The press stayed away at the personal request of the widow, and no fans or admirers were seen on the day.\n\nOn that same day, I was myself travelling back anonymously to Derbyshire with Adam Wilson and his family. He and Gertrude have agreed to remain with me as paid companions. I am able to reward them well.\n\nJulia and the children arrived back here three days later. For the time being she is the widow Angier, but as we fade from people's recollections she will quietly become, as is her right, Lady Colderdale.\n\nAfter the disagreeable shock of what happened to me in Lowestoft, I have settled down to what has become my new existence. I am not in decline, and my condition remains stable. I have little physical energy or strength, but I do not seem likely to drop dead suddenly. The doctor here repeats what I was told in London: good food, exercise and a positive outlook will cure me eventually.\n\nI asked Wilson to erect the Tesla apparatus in the basement, telling him that from time to time I shall be rehearsing In a Flash in preparation for my return to the stage. Its real use is, of course, otherwise.\n\n15th December 1903.\n\nAdam Wilson came to my reading room at half past ten this morning, and informed me a visitor was waiting downstairs to see me. It was Arthur Koenig!\n\nI asked Adam to bring him up.\n\nKoenig was in a serious mood. After we had greeted each other, I sat him down in one of the easy chairs facing my desk. The first thing he said was to assure me that his visit was unconnected with his job on the newspaper.\n\n\"I'm here as an emissary, my Lord,\" he said. \"I'm acting in my private capacity for a third party who knows of my interest in the world of magic, and who has asked me to approach your wife\".\n\n\"Approach Julia\"? I said, in genuine surprise. \"Why should you have anything to say to her\"?\n\nKoenig was looking distinctly uncomfortable.\n\n\"Your wife, my Lord, is the widow of Rupert Angier. It is in that guise that I have been commissioned to approach her. But I thought, bearing in mind what has happened in the past, it would be wisest to come to you first\".\n\n\"What's going on, Koenig\"?\n\nHe had brought with him a small leather case, and he now picked this up and laid it on his lap.\n\n\"The third party for whom I'm acting has come across a notebook, a private memoir, in which it is felt your wife would have an interest. In particular, it is hoped that Lady Colderdale, that is, Mrs Angier, might wish to purchase it. This, er, third party is not aware that you, my Lord, are still alive, and so I find myself not only betraying the person who is sending me on this task, but also the person to whom I should be speaking. But I really felt, under the circumstances-\"\n\n\"Whose notebook is it\"?\n\n\"Alfred Borden's\".\n\n\"Do you have it with you\"?\n\n\"Of course I do\".\n\nKoenig reached down into the case, and produced a cloth-bound notebook of the sort that comes equipped with a lockable clasp. He handed it to me so that I might examine it, but because it was locked, I could not see what was inside. When I looked back at Koenig, he was holding the key. \"My client requires five hundred pounds, sir\".\n\n\"Is it genuine\"?\n\n\"Most assuredly\".\n\n\"But is it worth five hundred pounds\"?\n\n\"I suspect you will think it worth rather more. It is written in Borden's own hand, and deals directly with the secrets of his magic. The concealment of life as twins is alluded to. I found it a most interesting read, and I can guarantee you will too\".\n\nI turned the book in my hand, wondering about it.\n\n\"Who is your client, Koenig? Who wants the money\"? He looked uneasy, clearly not practised in this sort of thing.\n\n\"My Lord, I suspect you have not heard the main news I am bringing. Are you aware that Borden has recently died\"? No doubt, my startled expression gave him the answer he required. \"To be precise, I believe one of the two brothers is dead\".\n\n\"You sound unsure,\" I said. \"Why\"?\n\n\"Because there's no conclusive proof. You and I both know how obsessively the Bordens concealed their lives, so it's no surprise that the survivor would do the same when the other dies. The trail has been hard to follow\".\n\n\"Then how do you know about it at all? Oh, I see this third party who has commissioned you\".\n\n\"And there is circumstantial evidence\".\n\n\"Such as\"? I prompted.\n\n\"The famous illusion is no longer included in Le Professeur's act\".\n\n\"There could be many reasons for that,\" I observed. \"I've been to his show several times, and he does not always include that trick\".\n\n\"Indeed not. But it would most likely be because both brothers are required to perform it\".\n\n\"I think you should tell me the name of your client, Koenig\".\n\n\"My Lord, I believe you once knew an American woman by the name of Olive Wenscombe\"?\n\nI remembered that Olivia had taken her mother's maiden name when she approached Borden.\n\n\"For reasons you surely appreciate,\" I said, \"I never speak of Miss Svenson\".\n\n\"Yes, yes. And I apologize for mentioning her. However, she is deeply bound up in the matter of the notebook. I understand that Miss Wenscombe, or Svenson, as you knew her, was in your employ some years ago, but she deserted to the Borden camp. For a while, she worked as Borden's stage assistant, but not for long. You lost contact with her, I think, around this time\".\n\nI confirmed that that was so.\n\n\"It turns out,\" Koenig continued, \"that the Borden twins own a secret hideout in North London. To be precise it is a suite of rooms in a well-to-do part of Hornsey, and it is here that one of the brothers lived incognito while the other enjoyed the comforts of home in St Johns Wood. They alternated regularly. After her... leave, Miss Wenscombe was installed in the Hornsey flat, and has been living there ever since. And will go on doing so if the court proceedings against her fail\".\n\n\"Proceedings\"?\n\nI was having trouble taking in all this information at once. Koenig went on, \"She has been served with notice to quit for non-payment of rent, and has to leave the flat next week. As a foreign national with no permanent residence, she would then be faced with deportation. It was for these reasons that she approached me, knowing my interest in Mr Borden. She thought I might be able to help her\".\n\n\"Continue\".\n\n\"You'll be interested to learn that Miss Wenscombe was not aware that there were two brothers, and to this day refuses to believe that she was deceived\".\n\n\"I asked her myself once,\" I said, remembering the grim interview with her in the theatre in Richmond. \"She said then that Borden was just one man. She knew my suspicions. But I can hardly believe that now\".\n\n\"The Borden brother who died was taken ill while in the Hornsey flat. It sounds as if he had a heart attack. Miss Wenscombe summoned Borden's doctor, and after the body had been taken away, the police came round. When she told them who the dead man was, they left to make further enquiries, but never returned. She later contacted the doctor, to discover that he was not available. His assistant told her that Mr Borden had been taken ill, but had recovered quickly and had just been discharged from hospital! As Miss Wenscombe had been with him when he died, she could not believe it! She went to the police again, but to her amazement, they too confirmed it.\n\n\"I heard all this from Miss Wenscombe herself. Now, from what she told me, she has no idea that Borden was maintaining a second household. As far as she was concerned, Borden was with her most days and nights, and she always knew where he was at other times. So then, Borden died suddenly, and she was shocked and upset as anyone in her position would be, but she had no reason to believe there was going to be anything unusual about it! And he certainly died, according to her. She says she was with the body for more than an hour before the doctor arrived, and it had gone cold by then. The doctor examined the body enough to confirm death, and said that he would sign a death certificate on his return to his surgery. Yet now she is faced not only with denials from everyone involved, but also with the incontrovertible fact that Alfred Borden appears on the public stage, performing his magic, and is obviously not dead\".\n\n\"If she thinks that Borden was only one man, how on earth does she account for that\"? I exclaimed.\n\n\"I asked her, of course. As you know, she is no stranger to the world of illusions. She told me that after much thought she came to the sorrowful conclusion that Borden had used magical techniques to fake his death, for instance swallowing some kind of medication, and that it was all an elaborate charade to enable him to walk out on her\".\n\n\"Did you tell her that the Bordens were twins\"?\n\n\"Yes. She scoffed at the idea, and assured me that if a woman lives with a man for five years she knows everything there is to know about him. She absolutely rejected the notion that there might have been two of them\".\n\n\"So this notebook has suddenly appeared, to solve all her problems,\" I said.\n\nKoenig stared at me thoughtfully, then said, \"Not all of them, but her most immediate ones. My Lord, I think that as a gesture of my good faith, I should let you examine the notebook without promise of payment\".\n\nHe passed the key across to me, and sat back in his chair while I opened the lock.\n\nThe notebook was written in a tiny hand, neatly inscribed in regular and even lines, but not at first glance legible. My magician's instinct was telling me to be on my guard against Borden's trickery. All those years of feuding had revealed the extent of his willingness to hurt or harm me. I had turned through about half the thickness of the notebook, when I paused. I stared at it, deep in thought.\n\nIt was more than possible that this was Borden's most elaborate attack on me yet. Koenig's story about Olivia, the death of Borden in her flat, the conveniently revealed existence of a notebook containing Borden's most valuable professional secrets, all these could be fabricated.\n\nI had only Koenig's word to go on. What would the notebook actually contain, if it were another trick? An intricate maze of deceits, which would manipulate me into some, misguided response? Could there be something here that would, through the person of Olivia Svenson, threaten my one remaining area of stability, namely my miraculously restored marriage to Julia?\n\nIt seemed to me that I was putting myself in hazard, even to hold the notebook.\n\nKoenig's voice interrupted my thoughts.\n\n\"Dare I presume, my Lord, that I can guess what is going through your mind\"?\n\n\"No, you may not so presume,\" I said.\n\n\"You are doubting me,\" Koenig persisted. \"You think that Borden has paid me, or pressed me in some way, to bring this to you. Is that so\"? I made no answer, still holding the notebook half open, with my eyes staring down at it.\n\n\"There are ways you could investigate what I am telling you,\" Koenig went on. \"A court action against Miss Wenscombe by the landlord of the apartment in Hornsey was heard at Hampstead Assizes a month ago. You could examine the court records for yourself. There are almoner's records at the Whittington Hospital, where an unidentified victim of a heart attack, with age and physical appearance matching that of Borden, was brought in on the day Miss Wenscombe says he died. There is also a record that that corpse was removed by a local doctor on the same day\".\n\n\"Koenig, you sent me on a trail of false evidence ten years ago,\" I said.\n\n\"I did indeed. I have never ceased to regret it, and have already told you that my dedication to your cause is the result of that error. I give you my word that the notebook is genuine, that the circumstances of it coming into my possession are as I have described, and that furthermore the surviving Borden brother is desperate to regain it\".\n\n\"How has it escaped him\"? I said.\n\n\"Miss Wenscombe realized its potential value, perhaps as something that might be published as a book. When her need for money became urgent, she thought it might be more valuable to you or, as she understood recent events, to your widow. Naturally, she kept the notebook hidden. Borden himself cannot approach her for it, but it surely is not a coincidence that ten days ago her flat was forcibly entered and the place ransacked. Nothing was taken. This notebook, which she had secreted elsewhere, remained in her possession\".\n\nI opened the notebook where my finger had come to rest. It was as if Borden had forced the page on me.\n\nThe rest of the sentence said: \"This is the real reason Angier will never solve the whole mystery, unless I myself give him the answer\".\n\n\"She wants five hundred pounds, you say\"?\n\n\"Yes, my Lord\".\n\n\"She shall have it\".\n\n19th December 1903.\n\nKoenig's visit exhausted me, and soon after he left (with six hundred pounds, the surplus was partly for his trouble to date, and partly for his silence and absence henceforth) I took to my bed where I remained until the evening. I wrote up my account of it then, but the next day and the day after I was too weak to attempt more than a little eating and a lot of sleeping.\n\nYesterday I was able at last to read some of Borden's notebook. As Koenig had predicted, I found it an interesting read.\n\nI have been showing extracts to Julia, who finds it equally interesting. She reacts more against his self-satisfied tone than I do, and urges me not to burn up any of my precious energy by getting angry with him again.\n\nWhat is most fascinating to me is that at last I have proof that Alfred Borden was the product of a conspiracy between twins. Nowhere they admit it, but the notebook is clearly the work of two hands.\n\nThey address each other in the first person singular. I found this confusing at first, as perhaps was intended, but when I pointed it out to Julia she observed that the notebook was apparently not intended to be read by anyone else.\n\nIt suggests that they call each other \"me\" by habit, and this in turn implies they have done it for most of their lives. Reading between the lines of the notebook, as I must, I realize that every event or happening in their lives has been one collective experience. It is as if they spent their lives from childhood preparing for the illusion where one would secretly take the place of the other. It fooled me, and fooled most of the audiences who saw them in performance, but surely, in the end it is Borden who is the fool.\n\nTwo lives made into one means a halving of those lives. While one lives in the world, the other hides, literally non-existent, a lurking spirit, a prestige.\n\n26th March 1904.\n\nI have been seriously ill. The symptoms have been horrific: persistent nausea and vomiting, paralysis of my right leg, an ulcerated mouth, and an almost uncontainable pain from my lower back. Needless to say, I have been confined in a hospital in Sheffield for much of the time.\n\nNow, though, a minor miracle has occurred and I find myself apparently on the mend. The ulcers have cleared up leaving no trace, I am getting some feeling and therefore movement in my leg and the general sense of pain and illness is receding. I have been at home for the last week, and although I have been bedridden, my spirits have risen a little more every day.\n\nToday I am out of bed. I am in the best of spirits, and I am re-reading Borden's notebook. These last two facts are not unconnected.\n\n6th April 1904.\n\nI have read Borden's notes a total of three times, and have annotated and cross-referenced them in detail. Julia is about to prepare a fair copy of my edited and greatly expanded text.\n\nAlthough the remission from my ailments continues, and for the last few days I have continued to feel better, I must face up to the fact that overall my health is declining. I therefore confess that in these terminal months of my life I am intending to take a last revenge on my enemy. He it was who caused this condition, he it is who must pay. Acquisition of his notebook has given me a way. I am planning to arrange for it to be published.\n\nWhile I was reading Borden's notebook it frequently occurred to me that it deserved to be published for the benefit of his fellow magicians. It contains much sensible comment on the art and technique of magic.\n\nI see it as my last act to arrange publication on his behalf, and when I have completed my annotated edition, I shall see to it.\n\nIf he survives me, which is likely, he will discover that my revenge is subtle and many-layered.\n\nFor a start, Borden will be appalled to discover, as he soon will, that what he sees as his greatest professional secrets have been published without his permission. His humiliation will be the deeper when he realizes that I was responsible. He will be baffled when he works out that somehow I was able to do this from beyond the grave.\n\nIn short, I have improved his text by making it less obscure, by expanding on many of the interesting general topics, which he merely mentions, by illustrating his absorbing theory of agreement with numerous examples, by describing the methods of many of the great illusionists. I have added detailed descriptions of every trick I know him to have invented, as well as those others I know him to be capable of performing, and in each case have seemed to explain each one without actually revealing the central secret.\n\nAbove all, I have heightened the mystery surrounding the illusion he calls The New Transported Man, but have given nothing away. The fact that the Bordens were identical twins is not even hinted at. The secret that obsessed these two men's lives remains a secret.\n\nThe surviving Borden will therefore realize that I had the last word, that the feud is over and that I triumphed. While invading his privacy I showed I could respect it. From this, I hope he will learn that the enmity he fostered between us was destructive, that while we sniped at each other we were wasting the talents in us both. We should have been friends.\n\nI will leave him this so that he may reflect on it for the remainder of his life.\n\nAnd there is one extra revenge, by omission: he will never discover the secret of Tesla's apparatus.\n\n18th May 1904.\n\nWith the work complete, we have submitted the manuscript to a publisher.\n\n2nd July 1904.\n\nI have agreed a publishing deal with Messrs Goodwin and Andrewson, of Old Bailey, London EC.\n\nThey will publish Borden's book before the end of this year, in an edition of seventy-five copies, at a price of three guineas each. They promise abundant illustration and intensive advertisement by personal letter to their regular clientele.\n\n4th July 1904.\n\nOver the last four weeks, my remission has ended, and the earlier illness has returned in force. First came the ulceration of mouth and throat. Three weeks ago I became blind in one eye, the other followed a day or two later. For the last week, I have been unable to keep down solid food, but Julia brings me a mild broth three times a day and that is keeping me alive. I am in such pain that I cannot raise my head from the pillow. The doctor calls twice daily, but says that I am too weak to be transferred to hospital. My symptoms are so distressing that I am unable describe them in detail, but the doctor explains that for some reason all my body's natural immunity to infection has been damaged.\n\n5th July 1904.\n\nI had an uncomfortable night, and as dawn broke this morning, I believed that I had reached my last day on this earth. It is, however, now approaching midnight and I am still alive.\n\nI started to cough early this evening, and the doctor came directly to see me. He suggested bathing with cool towels, and they have helped make me more comfortable. I am unable to move any part of my body.\n\n6th July 1904.\n\nAt a quarter to three this morning my life was brought to its end by a sudden seizure of the heart, following a spasm of coughing and consequent internal bleeding.\n\nMy dying was painful, messy and profoundly distressing to Julia and my children, as well as to myself.\n\nDeath uniquely surrounds my life!\n\nOnce, in harmless deception, I pretended to die so that Julia might live without scandal as a widow. Every use of the Tesla apparatus later brought death to my experience, several times a week. When Rupert Angier was laid falsely to rest, I was alive to bear witness to it.\n\nI have cheated death many times. Death has therefore acquired a sense of unreality for me. It has come to be a commonplace event that by some paradox, it seems, I can always survive.\n\nNow I have seen myself on my deathbed, dying of multiple cancers, and afterwards, after that dreadful and painful death, I am here to report it in my diary. Wednesday, 6th July 1904: the day I died.\n\nNo man should be so miserable as to have to see what I have seen.\n\nLater\n\nI have borrowed a technique from Borden, so that I am I as well as myself. I who write this am not the same as the I who died. We became two beings that night in Lowestoft, when Borden caused the malfunctioning of the Tesla apparatus. We went our separate ways. We have been together again since I returned to Caldlow House at the end of March, just as my temporary remission from the cancers began.\n\nWhile I yet lived, I maintained the illusion that I was one. One of me lay dying, while the other of me recorded my final concerns. All entries in this journal since 26th March have been written by me.\n\nWe are each the prestige of the other.\n\nMy dead prestige lies downstairs in his open casket, and will be placed in the family vault in two days' time. I, his living prestige, continue onward.\n\nI am the Right Honourable Rupert David Angier, 14th Earl of Colderdale, husband to Julia, father to Edward, Lydia and Florence, Lord of Caldlow House in the County of Derbyshire, England.\n\nI shall narrate my story tomorrow. The events of the day have left me, like everyone else in the household, too unhappy for anything but sadness.\n\n7th My 1904.\n\nThe remainder of my life begins on this day. What hopes can be entertained by one such as I! The following is my story.\n\nCHAPTER ONE.\n\nI came into being on the evening of 19th May 1903, in an unoccupied loge in the Pavilion Theatre in Lowestoft. My life began as I balanced on the wooden rail, from which I promptly fell backwards. I crashed to the floor of the loge, scattering the chairs. A thought had sprung into my mind an instant before: Borden had somehow found his way up to the loge and was waiting for me. Clearly not! Trying to orientate myself physically, I realized that although Borden had sabotaged the apparatus in some way, the transportation was completed.\n\nBright light flooded into the loge, as the spot was turned on it. No more than two or three seconds had elapsed. I thought: there is still a chance to save the illusion! I can crawl back to the rail, make something of it!\n\nI was about to climb up to the rail when, to my amazement, I heard a voice on the stage calling for the curtain to be rung down. I moved forward, keeping my head down, and peered down at the stage. Before the curtain blocked my view, I briefly saw myself, my prestige, immobile on the stage.\n\nThere is a compartment built into the base of the Tesla apparatus into which the prestige automatically falls as the transformation takes place. My old body, the prestige, is therefore concealed from the audience in order to give maximum impact to the illusion.\n\nThis time, Borden's intervention must have prevented the compartment from functioning, leaving the prestige in full view!\n\nI thought quickly. Adam Wilson and Hester were both backstage, and dealt with the emergency there behind the curtain. I was alive, strong and in full possession of my senses.\n\nI realized it was my responsibility to get to the backstage area, and confront Borden once and for all.\n\nI let myself out of the loge, hurried along the corridor, then took the stairs at a run. I passed one of the female attendants. I stopped in front of her, and said, \"Have you seen anyone trying to leave the theatre\"?\n\nMy voice came out as a harsh whisper!\n\nThe woman, staring straight at me, screamed in horror. I stood there helplessly for a moment, deafened by her terrible yell. I realized I was wasting time, so I laid my hand on her arm to push her gently to one side. My hand sank into the flesh of her arm!\n\nShe had collapsed on the steps, shuddering and moaning, as I reached the bottom of the stairs and found the door to the backstage area. I shoved it open, and again I felt my hands and arms pushing into the wood. I had to find Borden, and had no time to pay much attention.\n\nWithout noticing me, Adam Wilson ran past from his position; I called after him but he heard me no more than he had seen me. I paused for a moment, trying to think clearly about Borden's location. He had somehow interrupted the supply of electricity to the apparatus, and this could only mean that he had gained access to the sub-stage mezzanine.\n\nI found the stairs leading down, but as I went on to the top step, I heard the sound of feet running heavily towards me, and in a moment, Borden himself appeared. I froze. When he was no more than five feet away from me he looked up to see where he was going. He saw me instead! Once again, I witnessed the look of terror that had distorted the features of the female attendant. Borden stretched out his arms defensively in front of him. Almost at once, we collided.\n\nWe fell heavily on the stone floor of the corridor. He was briefly on top of me, but I was able to slide out. I reached towards him.\n\n\"Stay away from me\"! he cried, and crouching forward, stumbling, he scrambled away.\n\nI jumped at him, got my hand around his ankle, but he slipped it from my grasp.\n\nI shouted at him, \"Borden, we must stop this dangerous feud\"!, but once again my voice came out hoarsely and inaudibly, more breath than tone.\n\n\"I didn't mean it\"! he cried.\n\nHe was on his feet now and getting away from me, still looking back at me with an expression of dread. I gave up the struggle, and let him flee.\n\nCHAPTER TWO.\n\nAfter that night, I returned to London, where I lived for the next ten months, by my own choice and decision, in a half-world.\n\nThe accident in the Tesla apparatus had fundamentally affected my body and soul by placing them in opposition to each other. Physically, I had become a ghost of my former self. I lived, breathed, ate, passed bodily waste, heard and saw, felt warm and cold, but I was physically a ghost. In a bright light, if you did not look too closely at me, I appeared more or less normal. When the weather was overcast, or I was in an artificially lit room after nightfall, I could be seen but also seen through. My outline remained, and if people looked hard enough at me, they could make out my face, my clothes, and so on, but I was to most people a hideous vision of the ghostly underworld. The female attendant and Borden had both reacted as if they had seen a ghost, and indeed, they had. I quickly learned that if I let myself be noticed in these circumstances, I not only terrorized most of the people whom I encountered, but I put myself in some danger too. People react unpredictably when frightened. As a rule, I therefore stayed out of sight when I could.\n\nBut at the same time, my mind suddenly felt liberated from the constraints of the body: I became alert and fast thinking. One of the paradoxes this produced was that I usually felt strong and capable, whereas the reality was that I was unable to do most physical tasks. I had to learn to hold objects like pens and utensils, for example, because a careless grip on something would usually make it slip away from me.\n\nI found myself in a frustrating situation, and for much of the time my new mental energy was directed as pure hate and fear at the Borden who had attacked me. He continued to sap my mental energy, just as his action had sapped my physical being. I had become invisible to the world, as good as dead.\n\nCHAPTER THREE.\n\nSoon I discovered that I could be visible or invisible as I chose.\n\nIf I moved after dusk, and I wore the stage clothes I had been in during the performance, I could go almost anywhere unseen. If I wanted to move normally then I wore other clothes, and used greasepaint to give my features some solidity though it was not a perfect simulation. Money, food, accommodation presented no problems to me. Either I took what I wanted when in the invisible state, or I paid for what I needed. Such concerns were trivial.\n\nMy real consideration was the well-being of my prestige.\n\nI learned from a newspaper report that The Great Danton had suffered injuries during a performance in Lowestoft, that he had been forced to cancel future engagements, but was resting at home and expected to return to the stage.\n\nI was relieved to hear it, but greatly surprised! What I had glimpsed as the curtain came down was what I assumed was my own prestige, frozen in the half-dead, half-live condition I called \"prestigious\". The prestige is the source body in the transportation, left behind in the Tesla apparatus, as if dead. Concealing and disposing of these prestigious bodies was the single greatest problem I had had to solve before I could present the illusion to the public.\n\nWith this news, about ill health and cancelled engagements I realized something different had happened that night. The transportation had been only partial, and I was the sorry result. Most of me had remained behind.\n\nBoth I and my prestige were much reduced by Borden's intervention. We each had problems. I was in a ghostlike condition, my prestige was in ill health. From the moment of the accident, he was doomed to die; meanwhile, I had been condemned to a life in the shadows, but my health was intact.\n\nIn July, two months after Lowestoft, my prestige apparently decided of his own accord to bring forward the death of Rupert Angier. It was exactly what I would have done in his position; the moment I thought this, I realized that he was me. It was the first time we had reached an identical decision separately, and my first suggestion that although we existed separately we were emotionally but one person.\n\nSoon after, my prestige returned to Caldlow House to take up the inheritance; again, this is what I would have done.\n\nI, though, remained in London for the time being. I had macabre business to attend to, and I wanted to conduct it in secret with no risk of what I intended to do attaching itself to the Colderdale name.\n\nIn short, I had decided that Borden, finally, must die. I planned to murder him, or, more exactly, to murder one of the two. His secret double life made murder a revenge: he had interfered with the official records that revealed the existence of twins, and had lived his life with one-half of himself concealed. Killing one of the brothers would put an end to his deception, and would be as satisfying and effective as killing them both. I also reasoned that in my ghostlike state, and with my only known identity publicly buried and mourned, I, Rupert Angier, could never be caught or even suspected of the crime.\n\nIn London, I set my plans in progress. I was able to use my virtual invisibility to follow Borden as he went about his life and affairs. I saw him in his family home, I saw him preparing and rehearsing his stage show in his workshop, I stood unseen in the wings of a theatre as he performed his illusions, I tracked him to the secret place he shared in north London with Olivia Svenson... and once, even, I glimpsed Borden with his twin brother, briefly meeting in a darkened street, a hurried exchange of information, some desperate business that had to be concluded at once and in person.\n\nIt was when I saw him with Olivia that I decided, finally, he must die. Enough feelings remained about that old betrayal to add hurt to the outrage.\n\nThe mere thought of killing gave me such satisfaction and excitement that my personality changed. I, who was beyond death, lived to kill.\n\nOnce I had taken the decision, commission of the crime could not be made to wait. I saw the death of one of the Borden twins as the key to my own freedom.\n\nBut I had no experience of violence, and before I could do anything I had to decide how best to go about it. I decided I would have to stab him. I found, by experiment, that if I held a long-bladed knife in both hands, firmly but not tightly, then I could slide it with sufficient force to penetrate flesh.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR.\n\nTwo days after I had completed my preparations I followed Borden to the Queen's Theatre in Baiham, where he was top of a variety bill running all week. On that day, there was a matinee performance as well as one in the evening. I knew it was Borden's habit to retire to his dressing room between shows for a nap on his couch.\n\nI watched his performance from the darkened wings, then afterwards followed him to his dressing-room. When he was inside with the door closed, I went to where I had secreted my murder weapon and returned cautiously to the corridor outside Borden's room.\n\nI was wearing the stage clothes from Lowestoft, my habitual clothing when I wished to move unobserved, but the knife was a normal one. If I had been seen by anyone, it would have looked as if the knife were floating along unsupported in the air; I could not risk having attention drawn to me.\n\nAfter another check that no one was approaching, I went to the door and leaned against it, pressing my face gently but firmly into the wood. In a few seconds, the front part of my head had passed through, and I was able to see into the room. Borden was lying on his couch, with his eyes closed, and his hands clasped together on his chest.\n\nI withdrew my face.\n\nClasping the knife, I opened the door and went inside. Borden stirred, and looked towards me.\n\n\"Who's that\"? Borden said, narrowing his eyes.\n\nI took two steps across the narrow floor, then leaped up on to the couch and crawled on top of him. I squatted on his stomach, and raised the knife in both hands.\n\nBorden saw the knife, then focused on me. In the dim light, I was just visible. I must have been a wild and dreadful sight; I had been unable to shave or cut my hair for more than two months, and my face was skinny. I was sitting on his abdomen. I was holding a knife, preparing for the deadly thrust.\n\n\"What are you\"? Borden gasped. He had taken hold of my ghostly wrists, trying to hold me back, but it was a simple matter to work myself free of him. \"Who-\"?\n\n\"Prepare to die, Borden\"! I shouted, knowing that what he would hear was the hoarse and horrifying whisper that was all I was capable of producing.\n\n\"Angier? Please! I had no idea what I was doing! I meant no harm\"!\n\n\"Was it you who did it? Or was it the other\"?\n\n\"What do you mean\"?\n\n\"Was it you or your twin brother\"?\n\n\"I have no brother\"!\n\n\"You are about to die! Admit the truth\"!\n\n\"I am alone\"!\n\n\"Too late\"! I shouted, and I deliberately set my hands in the grip I had learned would give me the strongest grasp on the knife. I would lose the hold if I stabbed too savagely, so I brought the blade down to a place above his heart and began the steady pressure I knew would take the blade through to its target. I felt the fabric of his shirt slit open, and the knifepoint pressed down into his flesh.\n\nThen I saw the expression on Borden's face. He was full of fear. His hands were somewhere above my head, trying to get a grip on me. His jaw had fallen open, and his tongue was jutting forward. His chest was convulsing with his frantic breathing.\n\nNo words came out of his mouth, but he was trying to speak. I heard the hiss of a man drowning in his own terror.\n\nI realized that he was not a strong man any more. His hair was going grey. The skin around his eyes was wrinkled with fatigue. His neck was lined. He lay beneath me, fighting for his life against an insubstantial daemon who had come to squat on his body with a knife ready to slay him.\n\nThe thought repulsed me. I could not kill like this. All the fear, anger and tension poured away from me. I threw the knife aside, and rolled off. I backed away from him.\n\nHe remained on the couch, where he was shuddering with horror and relief. I stood, mortified by the effect I had had on this man.\n\nFinally, he steadied.\n\n\"Who are you\"? he said, and his frightened voice was uneven, breaking into falsetto on the last word.\n\n\"I am Rupert Angier,\" I replied hoarsely.\n\n\"But you are dead\"!\n\n\"Yes\".\n\n\"Then how-\"?\n\nI said, \"We should never have started this, Borden. But killing you is not the way to end it\".\n\nI was humbled by the awfulness what I had been trying to do. How could I ever have imagined that I could kill a man? I turned away from Borden sorrowfully, and forced myself against the wooden door.\n\nCHAPTER FIVE.\n\nI was thrown into a fit of despair and self-disgust by my attempt on Borden's life. I knew I had betrayed myself, betrayed my prestige (who was aware of none of my actions), betrayed Julia, my children, my father's name, every friend I had known. If ever I needed proof that my feud with Borden was an appalling mistake, at last I had it.\n\nIn a state of apathy I returned to the room I had rented, thinking there was no more I could do with my life. I had nothing more for which to live.\n\nCHAPTER SIX.\n\nI planned to waste away and die, but there is a spirit of life, even in one such as myself, that stands in the way of such decisions. I thought that if I did not eat and drink then death would simply follow, but I found that I was not able to resist thirst and hunger.\n\nI went through most of the winter in a miserable state, a failure even at self-destruction.\n\nIt was when I thought of the life of my other self, the prestige left behind me after Lowestoft, that I felt a sense of sharp focus. I knew at once he was in trouble. Once again, when I thought specifically about his health, I knew at once I had identified what was happening. He was ill, dying even. I had to be with him, help him in whatever way I could.\n\nBy this time, I was myself no great figure of physical strength. My poor diet and lack of exercise had made me into a virtual skeleton.\n\nI therefore decided to improve my appearance. I began to take food and drink in reasonable quantities, I cut my long hair, and stole a new set of clothes. Several weeks of care would be necessary to restore me even to my appearance after Lowestoft, but I did start feeling better almost at once, and my spirits rose.\n\nIn the last week of March, I bought a ticket for the overnight train to Sheffield.\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\n\nI knew that my sudden appearance would not surprise the part of me that I called my prestige.\n\nAt the house, I went and hammered on the door. I could have let myself in, but I had no idea what I should expect to find. I felt it best to take my unheralded return one-step at a time.\n\nHutton opened the door. I removed my hat, and stood plainly before him. He stared wordlessly, and his face was impassive. I knew him well enough to realize that his silence revealed his dismay.\n\nWhen I had given him time to accept who I might be, I said, \"Hutton, I'm pleased to see you again\".\n\nHe opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came.\n\n\"You must know what occurred in Lowestoft, Hutton,\" I said. \"I am the unfortunate consequence of that\".\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he said at last.\n\n\"May I come in\"?\n\n\"Should I say to Lady Colderdale you are here, sir\"?\n\n\"I should like to speak to you quietly before I see her, Hutton. I know my arrival here is likely to cause alarm\".\n\nHe took me to his sitting room beside the kitchen, and he gave me a cup of tea. I sipped it while I stood before him, not knowing how to explain. Hutton, a man I had always admired for his presence of mind, soon took control of the situation.\n\n\"I think it best, sir,\" he said, \"if you would wait here while I announce your arrival to her ladyship. She will then, I believe, come to see you. You may best decide how to proceed together\".\n\n\"Hutton, tell me. How is my-? I mean, how is the health of-'?\n\n\"His lordship has been seriously ill, sir. However, the prognosis is excellent and he has returned this week from hospital. He is recovering in the garden room, where we have moved his bed. I believe her ladyship is with him at this moment\".\n\n\"This is an impossible situation, Hutton,\" I said.\n\n\"It is, sir\".\n\n\"For you in particular, I mean\".\n\n\"For me and for you, and for everyone, sir. I understand what happened in that theatre in Lowestoft. His lordship, that is, you, sir, took me into his confidence. You will remember, no doubt, that I have been much involved with the disposal of the prestige materials. There are of course no secrets in this house, my Lord, as you directed\".\n\n\"Is Adam Wilson here\"?\n\n\"Yes, he is\".\n\n\"I'm glad to know that\".\n\nA few moments later, Hutton left and five minutes later returned with Julia. She looked tired. She came straight to me and we embraced warmly enough, but we were both so nervous. I could feel her tensing as we held each other.\n\nHutton excused himself, and when we were left alone.\n\nI explained to Julia the limits of my bodily existence; how I would fade from sight without bright light, how I could slip through solid objects.\n\nThen she told me of the cancers from which I, my prestige, had been suffering, and how by some miracle they had seemed to recede on their own, allowing me, him, to return home.\n\n\"Will he recover completely\"? I asked anxiously.\n\n\"The surgeon said that recovery sometimes occurs spontaneously, but in most cases a remission is only for a short while. He believes in this case, you, he.\" She looked ready to cry, so I took her hand in mine. She steadied herself and spoke sadly: \"He believes that this is just a temporary state. The cancers are widespread\".\n\nThen she told me the matters that most surprised me: that Borden, or more accurately one of the Borden twins, had died, and that his notebook had come into my, our, possession.\n\nI was astounded to hear these things. For instance, I learned that Borden had died only three days after my failed attempt on his life; the two events seemed to me inevitably connected. Julia said he had suffered a heart attack; I wondered if this could have been caused by the fear I rose in him? I remembered his terrible noises of anguish, his laboured breathing, and his general appearance of fatigue and ill health. I knew that heart seizures could be caused by stress, but until this moment, I had supposed that after my departure Borden regained his senses and would eventually have returned to normal.\n\nI confessed my story to Julia, but she seemed to think the two events were unconnected.\n\nEven more of interest was the news about Borden's notebook. I asked her if I, my prestige, had any plans about what to do with it, but she said that the illness had interrupted everything. She mentioned that she shared some of the remorse I felt towards Borden, and that my prestige was of much the same mind.\n\nI said, \"Where is he? We must be together\".\n\n\"He will be waking soon,\" Julia replied.\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\n\nMy reunion with myself must be one of the most unusual in history! He and I were perfect complements to each other. Everything I lacked was in him; everything I had he had lost. Of course, we were the same, closer to each other than identical twins.\n\nWhen either of us spoke, the other could easily finish the sentence. We moved in the same way, had the same gestures and mannerisms, came to the same thought in the same moment. I knew everything about him, and he knew the same of me. All we lacked between ourselves was our separate experiences of the last few months, but once we had described these to each other, even that difference was eliminated.\n\nOnce we were together, there was nothing that would make us separate again. I asked Hutton to make up a second bed in the garden room, so that the two halves of myself could be together the whole time.\n\nNone of this could be kept from the rest of the household, and soon I was reunited with my children, with Adam and Gertrude Wilson, as well as Mrs Hutton, the housekeeper. Everyone exclaimed about the uncanny double effect we created. I dread to think what effect this revelation of their father will have on my children in the future, but both parts of me, and Julia, agreed that the truth was better than yet another lie.\n\nSoon the chilling fact of the cancers made us realize that if there was anything remaining to be done, now was the time.\n\nCHAPTER NINE.\n\nFrom the beginning of April until the middle of May, we worked together on the revision of Borden's notebook, preparing it for the publisher. My twin brother (for so it became convenient to think of my prestige) was soon ill again, and although he had done much of the initial work on the book, it was I who completed the work, and negotiated with the publisher.\n\nAnd I, using his identity, maintained the journal for him until his death. So it was yesterday, that our double life came to an end, and with it comes the end of my own short life story. Now there is only me, and I live beyond death once more.\n\n8th July 1904.\n\nThis morning I went with Wilson down to the cellar, where we inspected the Tesla apparatus. It was in full working order.\n\nWilson asked me if we should dismantle the device.\n\nI thought briefly, then said, \"Let's leave it until after the funeral\".\n\nThe ceremony is planned for tomorrow at midday.\n\nAfter Wilson had left, and I had locked the access door to the cellar, I powered up the device and used it to transmit more gold coins. I was thinking of the future, of my son the 15th Earl, of my wife the widow.\n\nI had not counted the wealth we had created with the device, but my prestige had shown me the store he had made, kept in a closed and locked compartment in the darkest recess of the cellar. I removed what I estimated to be two thousand pounds' worth, for Julia's immediate requirements, then I added my few new coins to what was left.\n\nHowever, I would see to it that the Tesla device remained intact. Alley's instructions would be kept with it. One day, Edward will find this journal and realize what the apparatus can best be used for.\n\nLater.\n\nI have only a few hours left before the funeral, and cannot spend too much of that time writing in these pages. Therefore, let me note the following.\n\nIt is eight in the evening, and I am in the garden room I shared with my prestige before he died. A few minutes ago, I walked softly around the grounds of the house, breathing the summer scents, listening to the quiet sounds of this moorland country I loved so much during my childhood.\n\nIt is a fine warm evening in which to plan the end, the very end.\n\nLife has become not worth living. All that I love is forbidden to me by the state I am in. My family accepts me. They know who I am and what I am, and that my circumstances are not of my own making. Even so, the man they loved is dead, and I cannot replace him. Better for them that I depart, so that they might at last start to grieve fully and freely for the man who died. In the expression of grief lies recovery from grief itself.\n\nNor have I any legal existence: Rupert Angier the magician is dead and buried, the 14th Earl of Colderdale will be buried tomorrow.\n\nMy only expectation of life is as a ghost of myself.\n\nSo now, it must end, and I shall die.\n\nBut the curse of life also clings to me! I have already found how fierce the spirit of life burns in me, and that not only is murder ethically beyond me but suicide too is an impossibility for me. I can make myself die only by convincing myself that there is also a hope I shall not succeed.\n\nAs soon as I have completed these notes, I will conceal this journal, and the earlier volumes of it, somewhere amongst the prestige's which lie in the vault. Then I will unlock the compartment in the cellar, leaving the gold for my son or his son eventually to find. This journal must not be discovered while the gold is yet to be spent, because I have confessed of the forgery.\n\nWith all this completed I will charge up the Tesla device again and use it for the last time.\n\nI have spent the last hour measuring and checking the coordinates, preparing myself, rehearsing as if an audience of thousands will be watching. But this act of magic must take place while I am alone, because I shall project myself into the deceased body of my prestige, and there my end will come!\n\nI shall arrive there; of this, there is no doubt, because the Tesla apparatus has never faltered yet in its accuracy. But what will be the result of this morbid union?\n\nIf it is a failure, I shall materialize inside my prestige's poor, cancer-ridden body, dead for two days. I too will be instantly dead, and will know nothing about it. Tomorrow, as they lay the body to rest they will lay me with it.\n\nBut I believe there is a chance of another outcome, one that acknowledges my desperation to live. This materialization might not succeed in killing me!\n\nI am certain, almost certain, that my arrival in the body of my prestige will return life to it. It will be a reunion, a final joining. I have the spirit that he never had. I will reanimate his body with my spirit. I have the will to live that was taken from him; I will restore it to him. I have the vital spark that now he lacks. I will heal his body with my purity of health, will pump blood once more through his arteries and veins.\n\nIs it madness to think such a thing might be possible?\n\nI am mad enough, while I yet plan, to believe there is hope. That hope allows me to press ahead.\n\nThe mad reanimated body of my prestige will rise from its open casket, and be quickly gone from this house. Everything that has become forbidden to me will be left behind. I have loved this life, and have loved others while in it, but because my only remaining hope of life is an act that every sane person would find disgraceful, I must become an outcast, leave behind all those I have loved, go out into the world, make what I can of what I find.\n\nNow I shall do it!\n\nI will go alone to the end.\n\nPART FIVE.\n\nTHE PRESTIGES.\n\nCHAPTER ONE.\n\nMy brother's voice was speaking ceaselessly to me: lam here, don't leave, stay with me, come.\n\nI had to get out of bed. I put on my clothes quickly, grabbed my stuff and went downstairs. I looked at my watch. It was after 2 00 am.\n\nMy brother said: all right, now.\n\nKate was still in the dining room, sitting awake in her chair next to the fire. She was listening to a portable radio. She seemed unsurprised to see me.\n\n\"I was cold,\" I said. \"I couldn't get to sleep. Anyway, I've got to go and find him\".\n\n\"It's much colder out there\". She indicated the blackness beyond the windows. \"You'll need all this\".\n\nOn the chair opposite her, she had placed several items of warm clothing, including a wool sweater, a thick overcoat, scarf, gloves, a pair of rubber boots. And two large torches.\n\nMy brother spoke again. I could not ignore him.\n\nI said to Kate, \"You knew I was going to do this\".\n\n\"Yes. I've been thinking\".\n\n\"Do you know what's happening to me\"?\n\n\"I believe so. You'll have to go and find him\".\n\n\"Will you come with me\"?\n\nShe shook her head. \"No way on earth\".\n\n\"So you know where he is\"?\n\n\"I think I've known all my life, but it's always been easier to put it out of my mind. The difficult thing about meeting you has been realizing that what traumatized me as a child is still down there\".\n\nIt had stopped snowing, but the wind was freezing. In the centre of the garden, the snow was shallow enough to allow me to walk through.\n\nKate had switched on the intruder alarm, which flooded the area with brilliant light. It helped me see my way.\n\nMy brother said: I'm cold, waiting.\n\nI kept going. I saw the brick-built archway where Kate had said it would be. Snow was piled up against the base of it.\n\nThe door was not locked, and it moved easily when I pulled at the handle. The door opened outwards, against the drifted snow, and once I got a good hold on it, I was able to push the snow far enough out of the way for me to squeeze through.\n\nI peered inside, letting the beam of the bigger of the two torches play ahead of me. There was nothing much to see: a rocky roof slanting down, some steps and at the bottom a second door.\n\nThe word Yes formed, inside my head.\n\nThe second door had no lock, and opened smoothly at my touch. The beams of my torches swung around; one in my hand searched all about, the other tucked under my arm followed my direction of sight.\n\nThen my foot collided with something hard that jutted up from the floor and I stumbled. The torch under my arm broke as I banged against the rocky wall. Crouching on the ground, resting on a knee, I used one torch to examine the other.\n\nThere's a light, said my brother.\n\nI swung the single torch beam around again, and at shoulder height, I noticed an ordinary light switch. I flicked it on. At first, nothing happened.\n\nThen, further, down in the cavern, deep inside the hill, I heard the sound of an engine. As the generator picked up speed, lights came on for the full length of the cavern. They were only low-power light bulbs, attached to the rocky ceiling, but there was now enough light to see without the torch.\n\nThe cavern was a natural fissure in the rock, with extra tunnelling. The air was surprisingly sweet, and noticeably warmer than outside.\n\nI went several paces down the cavern, balancing myself with my hands against the rocky walls on each side. After a distance of about fifty yards, the floor dropped steeply and turned to the right, while to the left of the main tunnel I noticed a large cavity which to judge by the roundness of the entrance had been hollowed out artificially. The opening was not electrically lit, so I shone my remaining torch inside.\n\nI immediately wished I had not. It was full of ancient coffins. Most were stacked horizontally in heaps, although about a dozen were leaning upright against the walls. They were all sizes. All the coffins were in varying degrees of decay. At the base of most of the heaps were piles of brown, broken fragments, presumably of bone.\n\nI stepped back quickly into the main tunnel and glanced up towards the door by which I had entered. There had been a slight curve, and my way out was now invisible to me. Somewhere deep inside the cavern, the generator continued to run.\n\nI was trembling. But I could not go back. My brother was here.\n\nDetermined to resolve this quickly, I followed the path down and to the right. Another flight of steps followed.\n\nSupporting myself with my hand on the wall, I went down them. The tunnel immediately opened out into a wider cavern.\n\nIt was full of modern metal racks, brown-painted, held together with chromium-plated bolts. Each rack had three broad shelves, one on top of the other. A narrow aisle ran next to each rack, and a central aisle ran the whole length of the hall. A light was positioned above every aisle between the shelves, illuminating what they held.\n\nCHAPTER TWO.\n\nHuman bodies lay uncovered on every shelf of the racks. Each one was male, and fully clothed. They all wore evening dress: a close fitting jacket with tails, a white shirt with black bow tie, a waistcoat, narrow trousers, white socks and leather shoes. The hands wore white cotton gloves.\n\nEach body was identical to all the others. The man had a pale face, an aquiline nose and a thin moustache. His lips were pale. He had a narrow brow and receding hair, which was brilliantined back. Some of the faces were staring up at the rack above them, or at the rocky ceiling. Others had their necks turned, so they faced to one side or the other.\n\nAll the corpses had their eyes open.\n\nMost of them were smiling, showing their teeth.\n\nThe corpses all lay in different positions. Some were straight, others were twisted or bent over. Every corpse had one foot in the air.\n\nThe arms too were in varying positions. Some were raised above the head, some were stretched forward like those of a sleepwalker, others lay straight beside the body.\n\nThere was no sign of decay in any of the corpses. It was as if each one had been frozen in life.\n\nThere was no dust on them, no smell from them.\n\nA piece of white card had been attached to the front edge of each shelf. It was handwritten, and mounted in a plastic holder clipped to the underside of the shelf. The first one I looked at said this:\n\nDominion Theatre, Kidderminster 14/4/01 \n\n3.15 pm (M) \n\n2359/23 \n\n25g.\n\nOn the shelf above it, the card was almost identical:\n\nDominion Theatre, Kidderminster \n\n14/4/01 \n\n8.30 pm (E) \n\n2360/23 \n\n25g.\n\nAbove that, the third corpse was labelled:\n\nDominion Theatre, Kidderminster 15/4/01 \n\n3.15 pm (M) \n\n2361/23 \n\n25g.\n\nOn the next rack there were three more corpses, all labelled and dated similarly. They were laid out in date order. Theatres and dates changed. They were many.\n\nI moved on, squeezing down the narrow central aisle to the far end of the cavern. Here, on the top shelf of the final rack, I came across the body of a little boy.\n\nHe had died struggling. His head was tilted back, and turned to the right. His mouth was open, with the corners of his lips turned down. His eyes were wide open, and looking up. His hair was flying. All his limbs were tensed, as if he had been fighting to be free. He was wearing a dark red sweatshirt, a small pair of blue jeans, and blue canvas shoes.\n\nHis label was also handwritten, and it said:\n\nCaldlow House \n\n17/12/70 \n\n7.45 pm \n\n0000/23 \n\n0g.\n\nOn the top was the boy's name: Nicholas Julius Borden.\n\nI took the label and put it into my pocket, then reached forward and pulled him towards me. I held him in my arms. At the moment I touched him, the constant background presence of my brother faded away and died.\n\nI was aware of his absence for the first time ever.\n\nLooking down at him in my arms, I tried to shape him into a more comfortable position for carrying. His limbs, neck and torso were stiffly flexible, as if made of strong rubber. I could change their position, but the moment I released them they swung back into the shape in which I had found him.\n\nWhen I tried to smooth his hair that too moved back to its former position.\n\nI held him tightly against me. He was neither cold nor warm. One of his outstretched hands, clenched in fear, was touching the side of my face. The relief of finding him at last overwhelmed everything - everything except the fear of this place. I wanted to turn around so that I could head back towards the exit, but to do so involved moving backwards out of the corridor. I held my past life in my arms, but I no longer knew what might be standing behind me.\n\nSomething was, though.\n\nCHAPTER THREE.\n\nI walked backwards, not looking. I reached the main aisle, and turned slowly around.\n\nI saw that at this end of the hall there was another chamber, just five or six feet away from where I was standing. It was from here that the sound of the generator's engine was emerging. I went towards it. The entrance to the cavity was slanting and low.\n\nThe sound of the generator was now loud, and I could smell the petrol fumes emitted from it. There were several more lights within the chamber, beyond the entrance. I could not go through the gap without putting down Nicky's body, so I bent over to try to see what might be within.\n\nI had seen nothing. Nothing moved within.\n\nI took a step back, then another, as quietly as possible.\n\nThere had been someone standing inside that chamber, silently, motionlessly, just beyond my line of sight, waiting for me either to enter or retreat.\n\nI continued to step back down the shadowy narrow aisle between the racks, trying not to scrape Nicky's head or feet against the bodies on the shelves. Terror was draining strength from my body.\n\nA male voice said, from within the chamber, reverberating around the hall, \"You're a Borden, aren't you\"?\n\nI said nothing, paralysed by fear.\n\n\"I thought you'd come for him in the end\". The voice was thin, tired, not much more than a whisper, but the cavern gave it an echoing resonance. \"He is you, Borden, and these are all me. Are you going to leave with him? Or are you going to stay\"?\n\nI saw a ghostly shadow moving beyond the entrance, and then to my horror the sound of the generator faded quickly away.\n\nI was in impenetrable darkness. The torch was in my pocket. I shifted the weight of the little boy, and managed to get a grip on the torch.\n\nWith my hand shaking, I switched it on. I tried to get a good grip on the torch and keep Nicky's body held tightly in my arms. I twisted around.\n\nShadows of raised legs whirled about me on the cavern walls.\n\nI shoved my way along the rest of the aisle through the racks. My shoulders and arms were colliding with the shelves, and dislodged several plastic labels.\n\nI dared not look behind me. The man was following! My legs had no strength, I knew I could fall at any moment.\n\nIt was all uphill, now, and Nicky's deadweight seemed heavier with every step. I turned my foot, fell against the tunnel wall, recovered, kept walking on. Fear drove me.\n\nThe inner door appeared before me at last. Barely pausing, I pulled it open with my booted foot and forced my way through.\n\nBehind me, I could hear the footsteps following, pacing steadily.\n\nI ran up the stairs to the surface, but snow had blown in and was covering the top four or five steps. I slipped, fell forward, and the little boy rolled out of my arms! I leapt forward, pushed the door open with all my weight.\n\nI saw: snow-covered ground, the black shape of the house, two windows lighted, an open doorway with a light beyond, snow falling from the sky!\n\nMy brother yelled in my mind!\n\nI turned back, found him sprawled across the steps, and picked him up. I stumbled out into the snow.\n\nI staggered through the thick snow, aiming for the doorway, turning my head constantly to look back over my shoulder at the black rectangle of the open vault, dreading to see the emergence of whatever it was that had been following me.\n\nKate appeared at the open doorway, dressed in a coat.\n\nI tried to shout a warning to her, but I could not find the breath. I continued on, staggering in the snow, holding Nicky's body before me. At last, I reached the yard in front of the door, slipped on the snow-covered concrete and pushed past Kate into the brightly lit hallway beyond.\n\nShe stared wordlessly at the body of the little boy in my arms.\n\n\"Watch the vault\"! I said. It was the only sentence I could get out. \"Watch\"!\n\nNothing was moving, over there on the other side of the snow. I took a step back, put down Nicky's body on the floor.\n\nI fumbled in my pocket and found the label that had been on Nicky's rack. I gave it to Kate. I was still struggling for breath, and I felt as if I would never again breathe normally.\n\nI gasped, \"Look at this! The handwriting! Is it the same\"?\n\nShe took it from me, held it up in the light, and gazed intently at it. Then she looked straight back at me. Her eyes were wide with fear.\n\n\"It is, isn't it\"? I shouted.\n\nShe put her hands around the upper part of my arm, and held herself against me. I could feel her trembling.\n\nThe intruder light went out.\n\n\"Switch it on again\"! I shouted.\n\nKate found the switch. Then she held my arm again.\n\nThe snow whirled in the blaze of light. Through it, vaguely, we could see the entrance to the vault. We both saw the slight figure of a man emerging from the door of the vault. He was dressed in dark clothes. Long black hair straggled out from under the hood of his jacket. He raised a hand to protect his eyes from the glaring light. He showed no curiosity about us, or fear of us, even though he must have known we were there, watching him. Without looking at us, he stepped out on to the flat ground, hunching his shoulders in the blizzard, then moved to the right, between the trees, down the hill, and out of our sight.",
        "ru": "4 февраля 1892 года.\n\nВчера вечером я увидел нечто необыкновенное. В Лондон приезжает ученый по имени Никола Тесла, и его экстравагантные заявления на прошлой неделе были предметом разговоров всего города.\n\nИтак, вчера я и еще несколько сотен человек собрались у дверей Института инженеров-электриков, чтобы увидеть великого человека в действии.\n\nТо, что я видел, было захватывающим, тревожным и по большей части непонятным проявлением силы электричества. Мистер Тесла-соратник изобретателя Томаса Эдисона. Для современных лондонцев использование электрической энергии для освещения становится обычным делом, но Тесла сумел показать, что у нее есть много других применений.\n\nЯ наблюдал за его сенсационными экспериментами некритично, ослепленный и впечатленный. Многие из его эффектов поразительны, а многие другие глубоко таинственны. Когда Тесла заговорил, он говорил тоном евангелиста. Он действительно пророк того, что ждет нас в следующем столетии. Всемирная сеть электрогенерирующих станций, власть, отданная как скромным, так и могущественным, мгновенная передача энергии и материи из одной части мира в другую!\n\nЕго шоу имело странное сходство с любым хорошим иллюзионистом; зрителям не нужно было понимать средства, чтобы наслаждаться эффектами. Короче говоря, Мистер Тесла описал множество научных теорий. В то время как немногие в этой аудитории понимали больше, чем самые основные понятия, каждому из нас был предоставлен захватывающий взгляд в будущее.\n\nЯ написал письмо по указанному Теслой адресу и запросил копии его пояснительных записок.\n\n14 апреля 1892 года.\n\nЯ был занят подготовкой к своему европейскому турне, которое начинается во второй половине этого лета, и у меня почти не было времени ни на что другое. Однако, чтобы завершить вышеприведенную запись от февраля, я в конце концов получил объяснительные записки мистера Теслы, но не смог понять их ни с головы, ни с хвоста.\n\n15 сентября 1892 года.\n\nВ Париже.\n\nОни приветствовали меня в Вене, Риме, Париже, Стамбуле, Марселе, Мадриде, Монте-Карло... но теперь, когда все это осталось позади, я жажду только одного-снова увидеть мою любимую Джулию, Эдварда и Лидию и, конечно, мою маленькую Флоренс.\n\nБыло бы неразумно записывать размер моих доходов до тех пор, пока не будут подсчитаны все расходы и не будут выплачены оговоренные премии моим помощникам, но я могу с уверенностью сказать, что впервые в жизни чувствую себя богатым человеком.\n\n21 сентября 1892 года.\n\nВ Лондоне.\n\nПросматривая корреспонденцию, я увидел короткую записку от Доминика Бротона, одного из моих разведчиков:\n\nИсполнитель: Альфред Борден (Le Professeur de la Magie).\n\nИллюзия: Новый Перенесенный человек.\n\nЭффект: блестящий, его нельзя пропустить.\n\nАдаптивность: трудно, но как Борден каким-то образом справляется с этим, так и вы, я полагаю, могли бы.\n\nЯ показал это Джулии.\n\nПозже я показал ей еще одно письмо. Меня пригласили на мое волшебное шоу в Новый Мир! Если я соглашусь, мы начнем гастролировать в феврале с недельной резиденцией в Чикаго! А потом экскурсия по десятку или около того крупнейших американских городов!\n\nМысль об этом одновременно возбуждает и изматывает меня.\n\nДжулия сказала мне: \"Забудь о Бордене. Вы должны взять свое шоу в США\".\n\nИ я тоже думаю, что должен.\n\n14 октября 1892 года.\n\nЯ видел новую иллюзию Бордена, и она хороша. Это чертовски хорошо.\n\nОн начинает с того, что выкатывает на сцену деревянный шкаф, знакомый всем фокусникам. Она достаточно высока, чтобы вместить мужчину или женщину, имеет три прочные стены и дверь в передней части, которая открывается достаточно широко, чтобы показать весь интерьер. Он установлен на колесиках, и они поднимают все это достаточно высоко, чтобы показать, что никакой побег или вход не будет возможен через основание, не будучи замеченным зрителями.\n\nБорден закрывает дверцу шкафа, затем перемещает аппарат на левую сцену.\n\nСтоя у рампы, он произносит со своим удивительно неубедительным французским акцентом короткую лекцию о великих опасностях, связанных с тем, что он собирается сделать.\n\nЗа его спиной удивительно красивая молодая женщина вкатывает на сцену второй шкаф, идентичный первому. Она открывает дверь, чтобы зрители увидели, что она тоже пуста. Взмахнув черным плащом, Борден поворачивается и быстро входит в кабинет.\n\nБарабанщик начинает барабанную дробь.\n\nТо, что происходит дальше, происходит в одно мгновение. Когда барабан грохочет все громче, Борден снимает цилиндр, возвращается в кабинет и подбрасывает шляпу высоко в воздух. Его помощник с грохотом захлопывает дверцу шкафа. В то же мгновение дверь первой каюты, которую мы видели, распахивается, и Борден оказывается там! Шкаф, в который он вошел за несколько мгновений до этого, рухнул и опустел на пол сцены. Борден поднимает глаза, ловит цилиндр, надевает его на голову и, сияя и улыбаясь, выходит к рампе, чтобы поклониться!\n\nАплодисменты были громкими, и, признаюсь, я тоже присоединился к ним.\n\nБудь я проклят, если знаю, как он это сделал!\n\n13 ноября 1892 года.\n\nЯ взял Каттера с собой, чтобы посмотреть, как Борден исполняет свою иллюзию двух шкафов. Это случилось в Мировом театре Люишема.\n\nКогда Борден достал первый из двух своих шкафчиков, я почувствовал трепет предвкушения. Каттер, стоявший рядом со мной, поднял бинокль. Он вообще не смотрел на мага. Быстрыми движениями очков он осматривал остальную часть сцены.\n\nЯ продолжал наблюдать за Борденом. Насколько я мог судить, трюк был проделан именно так, как я наблюдал его раньше.\n\nНаконец, сияя, кланяясь, он принял заслуженные аплодисменты. Мы с Каттером присоединились.\n\nВ такси, мчавшемся обратно в северный Лондон, я спросил Каттера: Ну что ты думаещь об этом!\n\n- Блестяще, мистер Энджер! - заявил он. - Просто блестяще! Не часто выпадает шанс увидеть совершенно новую иллюзию\".\n\n- Ты знаешь, как он это сделал? - настаивал я.\n\n\"Да, сэр, я сделаю\", - ответил он. \"И я думаю, что ты тоже\".\n\n- Я сбит с толку, как никогда. Как, черт возьми, он может быть в двух местах одновременно? Я не вижу, что это возможно\"!\n\n-Иногда вы меня удивляете, мистер Энджер, - сказал Каттер. - Это логическая головоломка, которую можно решить только с помощью нашей собственной логики. Что мы видели перед собой\"?\n\n\"Человек, который мгновенно переносился из одной части сцены в другую\".\n\n- Это то, что мы думали, что видели, то, что мы должны были увидеть. Какова была реальность\"?\n\n- Вы все еще утверждаете, что он использует двойника? - спросил я его. - А как еще это можно осуществить?\n\n- Но ты видел это так же, как и я. Это был не двойник! Мы ясно видели его до и после. Это был тот же самый человек! Тот самый! Каттер подмигнул мне и отвернулся.\n\n- Ну? Что скажешь?\" - спросил я его.\n\n-Я говорю то, что сказал, мистер Энджер.\n\n- Я плачу тебе за то, чтобы ты объяснял необъяснимое, Каттер. Не шути со мной об этом! Это дело высокой профессиональной важности\"!\n\nТут он понял всю серьезность моего настроения.\n\n-Сэр,- твердо сказал он. - Вы, должно быть, знаете однояйцевых близнецов. Вот вам и ответ\"!\n\n\"Нет\"! - воскликнул я.\n\n- А как еще это можно сделать?\n\n- Но первый шкаф был пуст.-\"\n\n\"Значит все-таки появляются\", - сказал резак.\n\n- И второй шкаф рухнул, как только он его покинул.-\"\n\n- И очень эффективно, как мне показалось.\n\nЯ знал, о чем он говорит; это были стандартные сценические эффекты для того, чтобы аппарат, скрывающий кого-то, казался пустым. Некоторые из моих собственных иллюзий основаны на подобных обманах. Моя трудность была такой же, как и всегда; когда я вижу чужую иллюзию из зрительного зала, меня так же легко сбить с толку, как и любого другого. Но однояйцевые близнецы! Я об этом не подумал!\n\nТеперь, когда я записал этот рассказ о вечере, я думаю, что должен согласиться с ним. Тайна разгадана.\n\nЧерт бы побрал Бордена! Не один человек, а двое!\n\n30 ноября 1892 года.\n\nВчера я получил несколько замечательных фактов о Бордене.\n\nМолодой репортер из \"Ивнинг стар\" пришел взять у меня интервью. Его звали мистер Артур Кениг, и он оказался не только интервьюером, но и информатором!\n\nВо время сеанса вопросов и ответов он спросил меня, есть ли у меня какие-либо мнения, которые я хотел бы записать о своих магических современниках. Я рассказал ему о лучших своих коллегах.\n\n- Вы не упомянули Le Professeur, - сказал мой собеседник, когда я наконец замолчал. - Вы не придерживаетесь мнения о его работе?\n\n-К сожалению, я не присутствовал ни на одном из его выступлений, - сказал я.\n\n- Тогда вы должны пойти посмотреть его работу! - воскликнул мистер Кениг. \"Это лучшее шоу в Лондоне\"!\n\n\"Действительно\".\n\n- Я видел его выступление несколько раз, - продолжал репортер. \"Есть один трюк, который он делает-\"\n\n\"Я слышал об этом\", - сказал я, прерывая его. \"Что-то связанное с двумя шкафами\".\n\n- Это тот самый, мистер Дантон! Он исчезает и появляется в одно мгновение! Никто не знает, как он это делает\".\n\n-Никто, кроме его собратьев-магов, - поправил я. - Он использует стандартные магические процедуры.\n\n- Значит, вы знаете, как это делается?\n\n-Конечно, знаю, - сказал я. - Но, естественно, вы не ожидаете, что я открою вам точный метод. -\"\n\nТут, признаюсь, я растерялся. Вот он, мой шанс раскрыть тайну. Я почувствовал жажду мести, которую обычно подавлял. Но здравый смысл снова взял верх. Ни один маг не выдаст тайну другого.\n\nНаконец я сказал: \"Есть способы и средства. Иллюзия-это не то, чем кажется. Много практики и репетиций ... - Молодой репортер чуть не вскочил со своего места. - Сэр, вы полагаете, что он использует двойную двойную! Каждый волшебник в Лондоне думает то же самое! Я тоже так подумал, когда увидел его в первый раз\".\n\n\"Да, это его метод\". Я с облегчением обнаружил, насколько он прямолинеен.\n\n- Тогда, сэр! - воскликнул молодой человек. - Вы ошибаетесь, как и все остальные, сэр! Двойника нет. Вот что так удивительно\"!\n\n- У него есть брат-близнец, - сказал я. \"Другого пути нет\".\n\n- Это неправда. У Альфреда Бордена нет ни брата-близнеца, ни двойника, который мог бы сойти за него. Я лично исследовал его жизнь и знаю правду. Он работает один, если не считать ассистентки, которую видели на сцене вместе с ним, и технического менеджера, который строит его аппарат вместе с ним. В этом он ничем не отличается от любого другого в вашей профессии. Ты тоже-\"\n\n-У меня есть ingenieur,- с готовностью подтвердил я. - Но расскажи мне больше. Вы меня очень заинтересовали. Вы уверены в этой информации\"?\n\n\"Я есть\".\n\n\"Ты мне это докажешь\"?\n\n- Как вам известно, сэр, - ответил мистер Кениг, - невозможно доказать то, чего не существует. Все, что я могу сказать, это то, что в течение последних нескольких недель я привносил журналистские методы в расследование и не нашел ни единой капли доказательств, подтверждающих то, что вы предполагаете\".\n\nВ этот момент он достал тонкую пачку бумаг и показал их мне. В них содержались некоторые сведения о мистере Бордене, которые меня сразу заинтересовали, и я попросил репортера дать мне их.\n\nКениг разрешил мне взять рукописные выписки из нескольких его заметок, которые я тут же записал под его диктовку. В конце концов я протянул ему пять соверенов.\n\nКогда я закончил, мистер Кениг сказал мне: \"Могу я спросить, что вы надеетесь узнать из этого, сэр?\"\n\n- Я стремлюсь только улучшить свое собственное магическое искусство,- ответил я.\n\n\"Я понимаю\". Он встал, чтобы уйти. - А когда вы так поправитесь, вы тоже сможете исполнить\"Иллюзию профессора\"?\n\n-Уверяю вас, мистер Кениг,- сказал я с холодным презрением, провожая его до двери. - Уверяю вас, я мог бы проделать его трюк этой же ночью!\n\nА потом он исчез.\n\nСегодня я не работал, и поэтому я написал этот отчет о встрече. Мне необходимо узнать секрет иллюзии Бордена. Я не могу придумать более сладкой мести, чем затмить его собственным трюком, превзойти его, превзойти во всем.\n\nНо сначала я должен проверить имеющиеся у меня сведения о мистере Бордене.\n\n9 декабря 1892 года.\n\nНа самом деле я до сих пор ничего не сделал с Борденом. Американское турне было подтверждено окончательно, и мы с Каттером готовимся к нему. Я собираюсь путешествовать больше двух месяцев, и разлучиться с Джулией и детьми на такой срок почти немыслимо.\n\nОднако я не могу пропустить экскурсию. Новый Мир-это источник и место пребывания некоторых из лучших магов, действующих в настоящее время, и это великолепный комплимент, чтобы быть приглашенным на этот тур.\n\nА Борден до сих пор не побывал в США!\n\n17 января 1893 года.\n\nПоследняя неделя была кошмаром упаковок и приготовлений, а также подготовки к тому, чтобы аппарат, который мне нужен, был разобран, упакован, а затем отправлен впереди меня. Ничто не может быть оставлено на волю случая, потому что без моего оборудования у меня нет сценического представления. От этого трансатлантического приключения зависит очень многое!\n\nНо теперь у меня есть день или два свободного времени, чтобы морально подготовиться и немного отдохнуть дома. Дети спят, Джулия читает у себя в гостиной, и в тишине этого темного январского вечера, тихо сидя у себя в кабинете, я, благодаря трудолюбивому мистеру Кенигу, могу наконец записать плоды моих расспросов о мистере Альфреде Бордене.\n\nНиже приведены факты, которые я лично проверил.\n\nОн родился 8 мая 1856 года в Королевской больнице Сассекса на Богемия-роуд, Гастингс. Через три дня после его рождения он и его мать, Бетси Мэри Борден, вернулись в свой дом на Мэнор-роуд, 105, где отец работал плотником. Полное имя ребенка было Фредерик Эндрю Борден, и, согласно официальным записям, он родился один. Фредерик Эндрю Борден не был одним из двух однояйцевых близнецов при рождении, поэтому он не может быть таковым и сегодня.\n\nЗатем я изучил возможность того, что у Фредерика Бордена есть братья, близкие ему по возрасту и имеющие сильное семейное сходство. Фредерик был шестым ребенком. У него было три старшие сестры и два старших брата, но один из них был на восемь лет старше его, а другой умер в возрасте двух недель.\n\nБыл еще младший брат. Это был Альберт Джозеф Борден, седьмой ребенок в семье, 18 мая 1858 года. (Альберт + Фредерик = Альфред?)\n\nОпять же, существование брата, возраст которого был достаточно близок к возрасту Фредерика, увеличивало вероятность двойника. Я откопал и изучил записи о рождении Альберта в больнице, но мне было трудно узнать о нем больше. Тем не менее, я решил посетить фотогеничного художника-портретиста по имени Чарльз Симпкинс, у которого есть студия на Гастингс-Хай-стрит.\n\nМистер Симпкинс показал мне подборку своих дагерротипов. Среди них был студийный портрет Фредерика Бордена и его младшего брата. Снимок был сделан в 1874 году, когда Фредерику было восемнадцать, а его брату-шестнадцать.\n\nЭти двое явно не похожи внешне. Фредерик высок, у него благородные черты лица и высокомерная осанка, в то время как Альберт гораздо менее привлекателен. У него отвислый подбородок, одутловатые черты лица и круглые щеки, волосы волнистее, чем у брата, и, по-видимому, бледнее, и, судя по его положению, он был по крайней мере на четыре-пять дюймов ниже брата.\n\nЭтот портрет убедил меня, что Кениг был прав: у Фредерика Бордена нет близкого родственника, которого он мог бы использовать в качестве двойника.\n\nВполне возможно, что он рыскал по улицам Лондона в поисках человека, достаточно похожего на него, чтобы сойти за двойника, с помощью сценического грима, но что бы там ни говорил Каттер, я сам видел выступление Бордена. Большинство иллюзионистов видят двойников лишь мельком, или они искажают восприятие аудитории, надевая одинаковые костюмы, так что в те несколько секунд, когда двойник виден, он кажется оригиналом.\n\nБорден после превращения позволяет видеть себя, и видеть ясно. Он подходит к рампе, кланяется, улыбается, берет за руку свою ассистентку, снова кланяется, ходит взад и вперед. Нет никаких сомнений в том, что человек, выходящий из второго кабинета, является тем, кто вошел в первый.\n\nЯ до сих пор не знаю, как Борден работает с этой проклятой иллюзией, но я, по крайней мере, знаю, что он работает в одиночку.\n\nЯ отправляюсь в то место, которое быстро становится центром мира магии, и в течение двух месяцев я буду встречаться и, возможно, работать с некоторыми из лучших иллюзионистов в Соединенных Штатах Америки. Там будет много людей, которые смогут понять, как это делается. Я еду в Америку, чтобы построить свою репутацию и заработать много денег, но теперь у меня есть дополнительный квест.\n\nКлянусь, когда я вернусь через два месяца, тайна Бордена будет со мной. Я также клянусь, что в течение месяца после возвращения я буду исполнять превосходную версию того же трюка на лондонской сцене.\n\n13 сентября 1893 года.\n\nЯ не удивлен, обнаружив, что прошло почти восемь месяцев с тех пор, как я в последний раз приходил к этому дневнику, чтобы записать свою жизнь.\n\nДжулия и дети ушли. Каттер ушел. Большая часть моего богатства исчезла. Моя карьера прошла через апатию.\n\nЯ потерял все.\n\nНо я получил Оливию Свенсон.\n\nЯ оставил Джулию, чтобы быть с Оливией, после того как встретил и полюбил ее во время моего американского турне в начале этого года. Я встретил Оливию на приеме, устроенном в мою честь в прекрасном городе Бостоне, штат Массачусетс, где она подошла ко мне и выразила свое восхищение, как многие женщины подходили ко мне в прошлом. Оливия, работавшая тогда танцовщицей, присоединилась ко мне. Когда я уезжал из Бостона, она оставалась с нами, а потом мы путешествовали вместе. Более того, в течение недели или двух она работала со мной на сцене в качестве моей ассистентки и вернулась со мной в Лондон.\n\nКаттеру это не понравилось, и мы расстались сразу же по возвращении. Как, впрочем, и мы с Джулией.\n\nИногда, даже сейчас, я лежу без сна по ночам и поражаюсь безумию своей жертвы. Когда-то Джулия значила для меня весь мир, и действительно, она помогла построить мир, в котором я живу сегодня. Мои дети, трое моих беспомощных и невинных детей-не что иное, как жертвы той же жертвы. Все, что я могу сказать, это то, что мое безумие-это безумие любви; Оливия ослепляет меня от любого другого чувства, которое не является страстью к ней.\n\nПоэтому я не могу заставить себя записать, даже в уединении этого дневника, что было сказано, сделано и пережито в то время. Многое из того, что я говорил и делал, было моим, а все страдания-Джулии.\n\nТеперь я содержу Джулию в собственном доме, где она, чтобы сохранить видимость, ведет жизнь вдовы. У нее есть дети, она заботится о своих материальных нуждах, и она не должна видеть меня снова, если не хочет. В самом деле, если бы меня видели в ее доме, внешность была бы предана, так что я стал мертвецом. Я никогда больше не смогу встречаться с моими детьми в их собственном доме, и мне придется довольствоваться случайными экскурсиями с ними.\n\nВ таких случаях мы с Джулией встречаемся ненадолго, и ее нежная натура мучает меня. Но пути назад нет. Я застелил постель и теперь лежу в ней. Когда мне удается закрыть глаза на семью, которую я потерял, я становлюсь счастливым человеком. Я не ожидаю благоприятного суждения о себе. Я знаю, что обидел свою жену.\n\nЯ всегда старался никогда не причинять вреда окружающим. Даже в отношениях с Борденом я избегал причинять ему боль или опасность, предпочитая отомстить, раздражая или ставя его в неловкое положение. Но теперь я обнаружил, что причинил величайшую боль всем четырем людям, которые значили для меня больше всего. Рискуя быть обманутым, я могу только поклясться, что никогда больше не сделаю ничего подобного.\n\n14 сентября 1893 года.\n\nМоя карьера борется за новую версию стабильности.\n\nЯ чувствую, что наконец-то могу выбраться из ямы страданий и летаргии, в которую я провалился, и я готов вернуться на сцену. Я поручил Анвину найти мне заказы, и моя карьера может возобновиться.\n\nЧтобы отпраздновать это решение, мы с Оливией отправились сегодня днем в помещение театрального костюмера, где она выбрала и измерила свой новый сценический наряд.\n\n1 декабря 1893 года.\n\nВ моей записной книжке записано тридцатиминутное рождественское шоу, которое я должен показать школе сирот. Кроме этого, моя книга пуста. С конца сентября я заработал всего 18 фунтов 18с.\n\nХескет Анвин говорит о шепчущейся кампании против меня. Он предупреждает меня, чтобы я пренебрегал этим, потому что успех моего турне по Америке хорошо известен и легко вызвать ревность.\n\nЯ встревожен этой новостью. Стоит ли за этим Борден?\n\nЯ занимаю свои дни тренировками и репетициями. Хотя мое мастерство в престидигитации возрастает, иногда, в самые мрачные моменты, я задаюсь вопросом, почему я вообще продолжаю репетировать.\n\nПо крайней мере, сироты увидят чудесное развлечение!\n\n14 декабря 1893 года.\n\nБронирование было сделано на январь и февраль. Настроение наше поднялось.\n\n20 декабря 1893 года.\n\nЕще заказы на январь, один из них, я заявляю, оставлен вакантным неким профессором де ла Маги! Я с радостью возьму его гинеи.\n\n23 декабря 1893 года.\n\nСчастливого Рождества! Анвин прислал мне контракт на мое выступление 19 января в Королевском театре принцессы в Стритхэме. Это заказ, оставленный Борденом бесплатно. Я просматривал контракт, когда мой взгляд упал на один из пунктов ближе к концу. В нем говорилось, что мое исполнение должно соответствовать тому же общему стандарту совершенства, что и заменяемый акт.\n\nЯ думаю, что наконец-то смогу исполнить иллюзию Бордена.\n\nЯ так увлекся этой идеей, что весь день носился по Лондону, пытаясь найти кого-нибудь, кто будет моим двойником. Сейчас не то время года, чтобы искать; все безработные актеры работают в многочисленных пантомимах и рождественских шоу по всему городу.\n\nУ меня есть чуть больше трех недель, чтобы подготовиться. Завтра же начну строить шкафы!\n\n4 января 1894 года.\n\nНаконец-то у меня есть мой мужчина! Его зовут Джеральд Уильям Рут, он актер... и настоящий пьяница и скандалист. Однако мистер Рут отчаянно нуждается в деньгах, и я взял с него обещание, что, пока он работает на меня, он будет пробовать спиртное только после каждого представления. Деньги, которые я могу предложить ему, настолько щедры, по его обычным стандартам, что я верю, что смогу купить его надежность.\n\nОн того же роста, что и я, и его общая осанка и фигура примерно такие же, как у меня. Он немного полнее меня, но либо он потеряет лишние складки плоти, либо я надену подкладку. Это не имеет никакого значения. Хотя его глаза нечистого голубого цвета, а мои-цвета, обычно описываемого как ореховый, разница не заметна, и снова мы можем использовать театральный грим, чтобы отвлечь внимание.\n\nНи одна из деталей не имеет значения. Более потенциально серьезной является проблема его походки, которая заметно свободнее, чем моя, с более длинными шагами, и его ноги слегка поворачиваются наружу, когда он идет. Оливия взяла на себя ответственность за эту проблему и считает, что со временем сможет обучить его. Как известно любому актеру, походкой или осанкой вы передаете о персонаже больше, чем любым количеством черт лица, акцентов или жестов. Если на сцене мой двойник будет ходить не так, как я, его не примут за меня. Все очень просто.\n\nРут говорит, что понимает проблему. При условии, что в ту ночь его примут за меня, он заработает свои деньги.\n\nОсталось две недели на репетиции.\n\n18 января 1894 года.\n\nЯ нервничаю из-за завтрашнего спектакля, хотя мы с Рутом репетировали его до тошноты. В совершенстве кроется риск; если завтра я исполню иллюзию Бордена и улучшу ее, а я это сделаю, весть о том, что я это сделал, достигнет его в течение нескольких дней.\n\nЯ знаю, что есть еще ужасная правда, с которой я еще не столкнулся. Дело в том, что Борден мгновенно узнает, каким способом я вызвал иллюзию, но я все еще не знаю его.\n\n20 января 1894 года.\n\nЭто был триумф! Сегодня \"Морнинг пост\"описывает меня как\" возможно, величайшего из ныне живущих иллюзионистов Британии\".\n\nЭто очень мило. Но у него есть и кислая сторона, которую я никак не ожидал! В конце иллюзии пьяница Рут принимает овацию, держит Оливию за руку, кланяется, машет рукой и посылает воздушные поцелуи. -\n\nИ я могу только ждать темноты сцены, когда опустится занавес, прежде чем я совершу свой побег.\n\nЭто должно измениться. Мы должны устроить так, чтобы из неожиданного кабинета вышел я, поэтому переключение с Корнем должно быть сделано до того, как начнется иллюзия. Я должен придумать способ.\n\n21 января 1894 года.\n\nВчерашнее объявление в \"Пост\" произвело свое действие, и уже сегодня мой агент взял три заказа на мое выступление.\n\nЯ наградил Рута небольшим денежным бонусом.\n\n30 июня 1895 года.\n\nУже известных событий два года назад, кажется, как исчезает ночной кошмар. Я возвращаюсь к этому дневнику только для того, чтобы отметить, что я снова нахожусь на ровном киле. Мы с Оливией гармонично сосуществуем.\n\nЯ намерен еще раз поговорить с Рутом, поскольку последний не имел большого эффекта. Несмотря на великолепие его исполнения, он доставляет мне неприятности, и еще одна причина, по которой я возвращаюсь к этому дневнику, - это запись того факта, что нам с ним придется серьезно поговорить.\n\n7 июля 1895 года.\n\nВ мире магии существует главное правило: не вступай в конфликт со своими помощниками. Это потому, что они знают многие из ваших секретов, и поэтому они имеют особую власть над вами.\n\nЕсли я уволю Корня, я буду в его власти.\n\nПроблема, которую он представляет, - это отчасти его алкогольная зависимость, а отчасти его высокомерие.\n\nОн часто бывал пьян во время моего выступления, чего не отрицает. Он утверждает, что справится. Беда в том, что невозможно контролировать поведение сильно пьющего, и я боюсь, что однажды вечером он будет слишком пьян, чтобы принять участие.\n\nЕго высокомерие-еще худшая проблема. Он убежден, что я не могу эффективно функционировать без него, и всякий раз, когда он находится рядом со мной, мне приходится терпеть постоянный поток советов, основанных на его многолетнем актерском опыте.\n\nВчера вечером у нас была \"дискуссия\". Он сказал слова, которые я больше всего боялась услышать, что он может раскрыть мои секреты и разрушить мою карьеру.\n\nИ еще хуже. Он каким-то образом узнал о моих отношениях с Шейлой Макферсон. Разумеется, меня шантажируют. Он нужен мне, и он это знает. Он имеет надо мной власть, и я это знаю.\n\nЯ был вынужден даже предложить ему прибавку к гонорарам за выступление, и он, конечно, быстро согласился.\n\n24 августа 1895 года.\n\nСегодня я узнал, что Борден берет свое волшебное шоу в турне по Европе и Леванту и что он будет вне Англии до конца года. Любопытно, что он не будет исполнять свою собственную версию иллюзии двух кабинетов.\n\nХескет Анвин сообщил мне об этом, когда я видел его сегодня утром.\n\n25 августа 1895 года.\n\nЯ наконец понял, что с Борденом за пределами страны у меня нет необходимости продолжать выполнять иллюзию переключения, и поэтому без промедления я дал Руту отставку!\n\nК тому времени, когда Борден вернется из своего заграничного турне, я либо заменю мистера Рута, либо вообще перестану исполнять иллюзию.\n\n14 ноября 1895 года.\n\nНа следующей неделе, когда я открою короткий сезон в Королевском театре графства в Рединге, моей ассистенткой будет молодая леди, которую я тренировал последние две недели. Ее зовут Гертруда, она наделена гибким и красивым телом. Она невеста другого моего нового сотрудника, плотника и техника по аппаратуре по имени Адам Уилсон. Я хорошо плачу им обоим и доволен их вкладом в мое дело.\n\nАдам, я должен отметить, является почти точным двойником для меня с точки зрения телосложения, и я буду иметь его в виду как замену Рута.\n\n12 февраля 1896 года.\n\nСегодня вечером я узнал значение фразы \"кровь стынет в жилах\".\n\nВ первой половине представления я занимался одним из своих обычных трюков с игральными картами. В этом случае я прошу одного из присутствующих выбрать карточку, а затем написать на ней свое имя на виду у всех. Когда это делается, я беру у него карточку и рву ее у него на глазах, отбрасывая кусочки. Несколько мгновений спустя я показываю живую канарейку в металлической клетке. Когда мой доброволец берет у меня клетку, она таинственным образом рушится у него в руке (птица исчезает из виду), и он остается с остатками клетки, в которой видна единственная игральная карта. Когда он снимает его, он обнаруживает, что это тот самый, на котором написано его имя. Трюк заканчивается, и доброволец возвращается на свое место.\n\nСегодня вечером, в конце трюка, когда я сиял перед аудиторией в ожидании аплодисментов, я услышал, как парень сказал: \"Вот, это не моя карта\"!\n\nЯ повернулся к нему. Шут стоял с остатками клетки в одной руке и игральной картой в другой. Он пытался прочесть ее.\n\n- Позвольте мне взять его, сэр! - театрально прогудел я, готовясь прикрыть ошибку внезапным выпуском множества разноцветных лент, которые я держу под рукой на такой случай.\n\nЯ попытался вырвать у него карточку, но он отскочил от меня, торжествующе крикнув: \"Смотри, на ней что-то еще написано!\"\n\nНаконец я выхватил у него карточку, осыпал его разноцветными лентами, подозвал дирижера и помахал зрителям, чтобы они аплодировали.\n\nВ нарастающей музыке я стоял, парализованный, читая написанные там слова.\n\nОни сказали: \"Я знаю адрес, по которому вы ходите с Шейлой Макферсон - Абракадабра! - Альфред Борден\".\n\nЭто была та самая карта, которую я навязал добровольцу для фокуса.\n\nЯ просто не знаю, как мне удалось пережить остальную часть спектакля, но каким-то образом я это сделал.\n\n18 февраля 1896 года.\n\nВчера вечером я один отправился в театр \"Эмпайр\" в Кембридже, где выступал Борден. Когда он прошел через обычную иллюзию с кабинетом, я встал на свое место в аудитории и осудил его. Как можно громче я сообщил собравшимся, что в кабинете уже спрятался помощник. Я немедленно покинул театр.\n\nЗатем, неожиданно, я обнаружил, что должен заплатить цену за то, что сделал. Совесть поразила меня, когда я проделал долгий, холодный и одинокий путь на поезде обратно в Лондон. Я горько сожалел о том, что сделал. Легкость, с которой я уничтожил его магию, ужаснула меня. Магия-это иллюзия, временная приостановка реальности для пользы и развлечения аудитории. Какое право имел Т (или он, когда пришел его черед) разрушать эту иллюзию?\n\nОднажды, давным-давно, после того как Джулия потеряла нашего первого ребенка, Борден написал мне и извинился за то, что сделал. По глупости я его отвергла. Теперь пришло время, когда я с тревогой хочу прекратить вражду между нами. Сколько еще двум взрослым мужчинам придется издеваться друг над другом на публике, чтобы свести счеты, о которых никто, кроме них, даже не знает?\n\nВсю эту холодную дорогу до станции \"Ливерпуль-стрит\" я думал о том, как этого добиться. Сейчас, двадцать четыре часа спустя, я все еще думаю об этом. Я соберусь с духом, напишу ему, положу этому конец и предложу встретиться наедине, чтобы свести оставшиеся счеты, которые, по его мнению, должны быть улажены.\n\n20 февраля 1896 года.\n\nСегодня, после того как она открыла свои письма, Оливия подошла ко мне и сказала: \"Ты все еще встречаешься с Шейлой Макферсон, верно?\"\n\nПозже она показала мне полученную записку. Это было от Бордена!\n\n27 февраля 1896 года.\n\nЯ помирился с собой, с Оливией, даже с Борденом!\n\nПозвольте мне просто записать, что я пообещал Оливии никогда больше не видеть мисс Макферсон (и не увижу) и что моя любовь к ней бессмертна.\n\nИ я решил, что никогда больше не буду враждовать с Альфредом Борденом, как бы меня ни провоцировали. Я все еще жду от него публичной мести за мою вспышку в Кембридже, но не буду обращать на него внимания.\n\n5 марта 1896 года.\n\nДаже раньше, чем я ожидал, Борден попытался унизить меня, когда я исполнял хорошо известную, но популярную иллюзию под названием \"Трилби\". (Это тот, где помощник лежит на доске, балансирующей между двумя спинками стульев, а затем, как видно, парит в воздухе без посторонней помощи, когда стулья убирают.) Борден каким-то образом скрылся за кулисами.\n\nКогда я вытащил второй стул из-под доски Гертруды, скрывающий фон быстро поднялся, чтобы показать Адама Уилсона, сидящего на корточках позади, управляющего механизмом.\n\nЯ опустил главный занавес и прекратил свое представление.\n\nЯ не стану мстить.\n\n31 марта 1896 года.\n\nЕще один инцидент с Борденом. Так скоро после последнего!\n\n17 мая 1896 года.\n\nЕще один инцидент с Борденом.\n\nЭто меня озадачивает, потому что я уже установил, что он тоже выступал в тот же вечер, но каким-то образом он добрался через весь Лондон до отеля \"Грейт Вестерн\", чтобы сорвать мое выступление.\n\nОпять же, я не буду мстить.\n\n13 мая 1897 года.\n\nПосле многих долгих часов работы и репетиций мы с Адамом разработали стандартную процедуру переключения кабинета, которую, как я знаю, нельзя улучшить. Адам, после восемнадцати месяцев работы в тесном контакте со мной, может с точностью имитировать мои движения и манеры. Он мой двойник до последней детали.\n\nИ все же каждый раз, когда мы ее исполняем, наши зрители своими безудержными аплодисментами заявляют, что они не впечатлены.\n\nЯ не знаю, что я должен сделать, чтобы улучшить иллюзию.\n\n1 июня 1897 года.\n\nВ течение некоторого времени до меня доходили слухи, что Борден \"улучшил\" свою иллюзию переключения, но без дополнительной информации я не обратил на это внимания. Прошло много лет с тех пор, как я видел его в последний раз, и вот вчера вечером мы с Адамом Уилсоном отправились в театр в Ноттингеме, где Борден прожил последнюю неделю.\n\nЯ замаскировался под седые волосы, подушечки для щек, неопрятную одежду, пару ненужных очков и занял место всего в двух рядах впереди. Я был всего в нескольких футах от Бордена, когда он показывал все свои фокусы.\n\nВсе вдруг объяснилось! Борден существенно продвинул свою версию иллюзии. Он больше не прячется в шкафах. Больше нет всякой ерунды с каким-то предметом, брошенным через сцену (с которым я продолжал работать до этой недели). И он не использует двойника.\n\nЯ говорю с уверенностью: Борден не использует двойника. Я знаю все, что нужно знать о двойниках. Я могу заметить его так же легко, как облако в небе. Я абсолютно уверен, что Борден работает один.\n\nЗрители увидели множество банок, наполненных химическими веществами, шкафы, украшенные спиральными кабелями, стеклянные трубки и, прежде всего, множество сверкающих электрических проводов. Это был взгляд в лабораторию научного дьявола.\n\nБорден расхаживал вокруг оборудования, читая лекции об опасностях работы с электричеством. В определенные моменты он касался одного провода о другой или к колбе с газом, и там появлялась тревожная вспышка света или громкий взрыв. Вокруг него полетели искры, а над головой поплыл туман голубого дыма.\n\nКогда он был готов к выступлению, он указал, чтобы из оркестровой ямы прозвучала барабанная дробь. Он схватил два тяжелых провода, драматически свел их вместе и сделал электрическое соединение.\n\nВ последовавшей за этим яркой вспышке произошло переключение. На наших глазах Борден исчез с того места, где стоял, и мгновенно появился на другой стороне сцены - по крайней мере, в двадцати футах от того места, где он только что стоял!\n\nБорден вышел вперед под бурные аплодисменты, чтобы поклониться.\n\nАплодисменты продолжались еще долго, и я сообщаю, что мои руки хлопали так же громко, как и у всех.\n\nПочему этот товарищ-маг, столь одаренный, наделенный мастерством и профессионализмом, затеял против меня злобную вражду?\n\n5 марта 1898 года.\n\nЯ много работал, и у меня было мало времени для дневника. Сегодня у меня нет заказов, поэтому я могу сделать короткую запись.\n\nС той ночи в Ноттингеме мы с Адамом не включали в мой номер иллюзию переключения.\n\nБорден дважды прерывал мои выступления. Один из приступов мне удалось отшутиться, но другой на несколько минут стал катастрофой.\n\nВ результате я отказался от своего фасада молчаливого презрения.\n\nУ меня осталось две амбиции. Первое-добиться какого-то примирения с Юлией и детьми. Я знаю, что потерял ее навсегда, но расстояние, которое она ставит между нами, невыносимо. Второй по сравнению с ним незначителен. Теперь, когда мое одностороннее перемирие с Борденом закончилось, я хочу раскрыть тайну его иллюзии, чтобы снова превзойти его.\n\n31 июля 1898 года.\n\nОливия предложила идею!\n\nПрежде чем описать его, я должен сказать, что в последние месяцы страсть между Оливией и мной заметно остыла. Мы продолжаем мирно сосуществовать и иногда ведем себя как муж и жена, но в целом мы больше не ведем себя так, как будто любим или заботимся друг о друге. И все же мы держимся вместе.\n\nСегодня после ужина Оливия ушла от меня, прихватив с собой бутылку джина. Я привык к тому, что она пьет в одиночестве, и больше не замечаю этого.\n\nОднако через несколько минут вошла ее горничная Люси и спросила, не сойду ли я на несколько минут вниз.\n\nОливия сидела за карточным столиком, на котором стояли две или три бутылки и два стакана, а напротив нее стоял пустой стул. Она жестом пригласила меня сесть, а затем налила мне выпить.\n\n-Робби,- сказала она со своей привычной прямотой. \"Я собираюсь оставить тебя\".\n\nЯ что - то пробормотал в ответ. Я уже несколько месяцев ожидал подобного развития событий, хотя понятия не имел, как с этим справлюсь.\n\n-Я оставлю тебя, - повторила она, - а потом вернусь. Вы хотите знать, почему\"?\n\nЯ сказал, что знаю.\n\n- Потому что есть кое-что, чего ты хочешь больше, чем меня. Я думаю, что если я выйду туда и найду его для тебя, то у меня будет шанс заставить тебя хотеть меня снова\".\n\nЯ заверил ее, что хочу ее так же сильно, как и прежде, но она оборвала меня.\n\n-Я знаю, что происходит, - заявила она. - Вы с этим Альфредом Борденом похожи на двух влюбленных, которые никак не могут ужиться. Я прав\"?\n\nЯ попытался уклониться, но, увидев решимость в ее глазах, быстро согласился.\n\n\"Посмотри на это\"! - сказала она и показала номер \"Сцены\" за эту неделю. \"Смотри сюда\". Она сложила газету пополам и протянула мне. Она обвела кружком одно из объявлений на первой полосе.\n\n-Это твой друг Борден,- сказала она. - Видишь, что он говорит?\n\nДля работы на полную ставку требуется привлекательная молодая женщина-ассистент сцены. Она должна быть сильной и подтянутой, готовой путешествовать и работать долгие часы, как на сцене, так и вне ее. Приятная внешность очень важна, как и готовность участвовать в захватывающих и требовательных процедурах перед большой аудиторией. Пожалуйста, подайте заявку, также с подходящими рекомендациями.\n\nДалее следовал адрес репетиционной комнаты Альфреда Бордена.\n\n- Он уже пару недель ищет помощника. Думаю, я мог бы ему помочь\".\n\n- Ты имеешь в виду себя-\"\n\n- Ты всегда говорил, что я лучший помощник, который у тебя когда-либо был.\n\n- Но ты? Будешь работать на него\"? Я печально покачал головой. - Как ты могла так поступить со мной, Оливия?\n\n- Ты хочешь узнать, как он делает этот трюк, не так ли? - сказала она.\n\nЯ молча сидел перед ней, глядя на нее. Если она сможет завоевать его доверие, работать с ним на репетициях и на сцене, свободно передвигаться в его мастерской, то вскоре тайна Бордена станет моей.\n\nВскоре мы перешли к деталям.\n\nНеобходимость давать рекомендации какое-то время казалась проблемой, потому что Оливия не работала ни на кого, кроме меня, но она указала, что я вполне способна подделывать письма.\n\nПрошло часа два, а то и больше, пока мы обсуждали ее идею и начинали строить планы. Мы опустошили бутылку джина, а Оливия продолжала твердить: - Я открою тебе секрет, Робби. Это то, чего ты от меня хочешь, не так ли\"? И я сказал, что да, но что не хочу ее терять.\n\nЯ разрывалась между эйфорией от решительного удара по нему и перспективой, что он отомстит еще сильнее, если поймет, что Оливия моя. Я высказал эти опасения. Она ответила: \"Я вернусь к тебе, Робби, и принесу тебе тайну Бордена ...\" Вскоре мы были пьяны, игривы и ласковы.\n\nЯ должен подделать для нее одно или два свидетельства. Мы используем адрес ее горничной для poste restante; она берет девичью фамилию своей матери.\n\n14 августа 1898 года.\n\nБорден ответил (по крайней мере, ассистент по имени Т. Элборн ответил от его имени), предложив провести собеседование в начале следующей недели.\n\nЯ вдруг воспротивился этому, так как за последние несколько дней вновь обрел счастье с Оливией и еще больше, чем когда-либо, не хотел видеть, как она попадет в лапы Бордена.\n\nОливия все еще хочет пройти через это.\n\n18 августа 1898 года.\n\nОливия была на собеседовании и вернулась с него, и она говорит, что это ее работа.\n\nПока ее не было, меня мучили страхи и сожаления.\n\nОливия отсутствовала гораздо дольше, чем мы оба ожидали, и я всерьез задумался, что же мне делать, когда она неожиданно вернулась. Она была в приподнятом настроении.\n\nДа, это ее работа. Да, Борден прочитал мои рекомендации и принял их как подлинные. Нет, никаких явных подозрений на мой счет не было.\n\nОна рассказала мне о некоторых аппаратах, которые видела у него в мастерской, но все они были удручающе обычными.\n\n- Он что-нибудь говорил об иллюзии переключения? - спросил я ее.\n\n- Ни слова. Но он сказал мне, что есть несколько трюков, которые он делает в одиночку и для которых ему не нужен ассистент сцены\".\n\nПозже, сказав, что устала, она легла спать.\n\n27 августа 1898 года.\n\nКонец еще одной недели, а у Оливии по - прежнему нет для меня никакой информации. Она, кажется, не хочет говорить со мной об этом.\n\nСегодня вечером она дала мне бесплатный пропуск на следующую серию выступлений Бордена. Оливия будет на сцене вместе с ним.\n\n3 сентября 1898 года.\n\nОливия сегодня вечером вообще не вернулась домой. Я озадачен, встревожен и полон страхов.\n\n4 сентября 1898 года.\n\nЯ послал мальчика в мастерскую Бордена с посланием для нее, но он вернулся и сказал, что дом заперт на засов и внутри, по-видимому, никого нет.\n\n12 сентября 1898 года.\n\nПоскольку Оливия больше не возвращалась домой, я взял пропуск, который она мне дала, и отправился в кассу театра на Лестер-сквер. Здесь я потребовал билет на шоу Бордена. Я намеренно выбрал место в дальнем конце партера, чтобы мое присутствие не было замечено со сцены.\n\nЯ видел Оливию. Ее появление ускорило мой пульс.\n\nБорден довел свое шоу до кульминации с помощью иллюзии электрического выключателя, исполнив его с талантом, который еще больше погрузил меня в депрессию. Когда Оливия вернулась на сцену, чтобы поклониться ему в последний раз, мое уныние было полным. Она выглядела красивой, счастливой и взволнованной, и моему встревоженному взгляду показалось, что, когда Борден держал ее за руку для аплодисментов, он делал это с излишней нежностью.\n\nРешив довести дело до конца, я выбежал из зала и поспешил к Выходу. Хотя я ждал, пока другие артисты уйдут, и пока швейцар запер дверь и выключил свет, я не видел ни Бордена, ни Оливии, выходящих из здания.\n\n18 сентября 1898 года.\n\nСегодня горничная Оливии принесла мне письмо, которое она получила от своей госпожи.\n\nЯ с тревогой прочел его, цепляясь за надежду, что в нем может содержаться ключ к тому, что произошло, но там было только сказано::\n\nЛюси,\n\nБудьте добры, соберите все мои вещи в пакеты и чемоданы и как можно скорее доставьте их к Служебному входу театра \"Стрэнд\".\n\nПожалуйста, убедитесь, что все четко обозначено как предназначенное для меня, и я организую сбор.\n\nЯ прилагаю сумму, чтобы покрыть расходы, а то, что останется, вы должны оставить себе, если вам понадобится рекомендация для вашего следующего места работы, мистер Энглер, конечно, напишет ее для вас.\n\nСпасибо,\n\nОливия Свенсон\n\nМне пришлось прочитать это письмо вслух бедной девушке и объяснить, какое отношение она имеет к пятифунтовой банкноте, вложенной Оливией.\n\n4 декабря 1898 года.\n\nВ настоящее время я занят на сезон спектаклей в театре \"Плаза\" в Ричмонде, на берегу Темзы. Сегодня вечером я отдыхал в своей гримерке между первым и вторым выступлениями, когда кто-то постучал в дверь.\n\nЭто была Оливия. Я впустил ее в комнату. Она выглядела красивой, но усталой и сказала, что весь день пыталась найти меня.\n\n- Робби, я добыла для тебя нужную информацию, - сказала она и протянула мне запечатанный конверт. - Я принес тебе это, хотя ты должна понимать, что я не собираюсь возвращаться к тебе. Вы должны пообещать мне, что ваша вражда с Альфредом немедленно прекратится. Если вы это сделаете, я отдам вам конверт\".\n\nЯ сказал ей, что, по моему мнению, вражда уже закончилась.\n\n- Тогда зачем тебе его секрет?\n\n-Ты, конечно, знаешь почему, - сказал я.\n\n\"Только для того, чтобы продолжить вражду\"!\n\nЯ знал, что она говорит правду, но сказал: \"Мне любопытно\".\n\nОна торопилась уйти, сказав, что Борден уже заподозрит ее долгое отсутствие.\n\nНаконец она протянула ему конверт.\n\nДержа его в руке, я спросил: \"Неужели для меня это действительно конец тайны?\"\n\n\"Я верю, что это так, да\".\n\nОна повернулась, чтобы уйти, и открыла дверь.\n\n- Могу я спросить тебя еще кое о чем, Оливия?\n\n\"Что это\"?\n\n- Борден-это один человек или два?\n\nОна улыбнулась, и я с ужасом увидел улыбку женщины, думающей о своем возлюбленном. - Он всего лишь один человек, уверяю вас.\n\nЯ последовал за ней в коридор.\n\n\"Теперь ты счастлив\"? - спросил я ее.\n\n- Да, это я. Прости, если я причинила тебе боль, Робби.\n\nИ она ушла, не обняв меня, даже не улыбнувшись и не коснувшись моих рук. Это было больно.\n\nЯ вернулся в гардеробную, закрыл дверь и сразу же вскрыл конверт. В нем был один листок бумаги и одно-единственное слово.\n\nТесла.\n\n10 июля 1900 года.\n\nКолорадо-Спрингс, штат Колорадо\n\nЯ нашел скромный, но привлекательный отель, подходящий для моих нужд, и, поскольку мне сразу понравился мой номер, я зарегистрировался на неделю с возможностью продлить его в случае необходимости.\n\nИз окна своей комнаты я вижу две из трех особенностей Колорадо-Спрингс, которые привели меня сюда.\n\nВесь город танцует с электрическими огнями после захода солнца; на улицах высокие фонари, в каждом доме ярко освещенные окна.\n\nЗнаменитая гора стоит рядом с городом: пик Пайка, почти 15 000 футов в высоту.\n\nЗавтра я совершу свое первое восхождение по нижним склонам пика Пайка и отыщу третью замечательную особенность, которая привела меня в этот город.\n\n12 июля 1900 года.\n\nВчера вечером я был слишком утомлен, чтобы писать в дневнике, но сегодня я один в городе, так что у меня есть масса возможностей описать то, что произошло.\n\nЯ проснулся рано, позавтракал в гостинице и быстро пошел на центральную площадь города, где меня должна была ждать карета. Об этом я договорился письмом перед отъездом из Лондона.\n\nВ непринужденной американской манере мы с моим мужчиной быстро стали большими друзьями. Его зовут Рэндалл Д. Гилпин, он родился и вырос в Колорадо. Я зову его Рэнди, а он меня Робби. Он невысокий и кругленький, с густыми седыми бакенбардами вокруг веселого лица. Глаза у него голубые, а волосы, как и бакенбарды, серо-стальные. Он носит кожаную шляпу. Он носит под сиденьем ружье, из которого гонит лошадей, и сказал мне, что держит его заряженным.\n\nПуть к лаборатории Николы Теслы-это непрерывный подъем по восточному склону великой горы.\n\nЧерез полтора часа мы вышли на плато на северо-восточном склоне горы, и здесь совсем не росло деревьев. В центре этого небольшого плато находилась лаборатория Теслы.\n\n- У тебя здесь дела, Робби? - сказал Рэнди. - Смотри, как идешь. Здесь может быть опасно, судя по тому, что говорят люди\".\n\n- Я знаю, чем рискую, - сказал я. Рэнди сказал мне, что у него есть свои дела, но он вернется в лабораторию после обеда и будет ждать меня, пока я не появлюсь.\n\nЯ заметил, что он не подъезжает к дому слишком близко, и последние четыреста-пятьсот ярдов мне пришлось пройти пешком.\n\nЛаборатория представляла собой квадратное сооружение с покатыми крышами, построенное из некрашеного дерева. В центре здания вертикально поднимался высокий металлический столб, на вершине которого была большая металлическая сфера. Он поблескивал в ярком утреннем солнце и мягко покачивался на свежем ветру, дувшем вдоль горного склона.\n\nПо обеим сторонам тропинки на земле было установлено множество технических приборов непонятного назначения. В каменистую почву было вбито множество металлических столбов, и большинство из них были соединены друг с другом изолированными проводами. Рядом с главным зданием стояла деревянная рама со стеклянной стеной, внутри которой я увидел несколько измерительных шкал или регистров.\n\nЯ услышал внезапный и сильный треск, и из здания донеслась серия ярких и ужасающих вспышек: белых, голубовато-белых, розово-белых, быстро повторявшихся.\n\nПризнаюсь, в этот момент моя решимость ненадолго подвела меня. Мое слабое сердце стало еще слабее, когда через два или три шага я наткнулся на нарисованную от руки вывеску, висевшую на стене рядом с главной дверью. Он сказал:\n\nБОЛЬШАЯ ОПАСНОСТЬ.\n\nДержись Подальше!\n\nПока я читал эти строки, электрические разряды внутри стихли. Я стукнул кулаком в дверь.\n\nПодождав несколько минут, Никола Тесла сам открыл дверь. Выражение его лица было рассеянным, как у занятого человека, которого раздражающе прервали. Начало было не из лучших, но я постарался.\n\n\"Мистер Тесла\"? Я сказал. - Меня зовут Руперт Энджер. Интересно, помните ли вы нашу переписку? Я писал вам из Англии\".\n\n\"Я никого не знаю в Англии\"! Он смотрел мне за спину, словно прикидывая, сколько еще англичан я привел с собой. - Повторите ваше имя еще раз, добрый сэр?\n\n- Меня зовут Руперт Энджер. Я присутствовал на вашей демонстрации в Лондоне и был очень заинтересован. -\"\n\n- Ты и есть волшебник! Тот самый, о котором мистер Элли все знает?\n\n- Я волшебник, - подтвердил я, хотя смысл его второго вопроса был мне непонятен.\n\n\"Вы можете войти\"!\n\nСтолько впечатлений о нем сразу. Сначала я заметил его лицо. Он был худощав, умен и красив, с сильными славянскими скулами. У него были тонкие усики, а волосы разделены пробором посередине. Он был похож на человека, который работает много часов и спит только тогда, когда нет альтернативы усталости.\n\nТесла обладает незаурядным умом. Как только я объяснил ему, кто я такой, он вспомнил не только то, о чем мы коротко переписывались, но и то, что я писал ему раньше, около восьми лет назад, прося копию его записей.\n\nВ лаборатории он представил меня своему ассистенту, мистеру Элли. Этот интересный человек, по-видимому, выполнял в жизни Теслы множество ролей: от научного помощника и сотрудника до домашнего слуги и компаньона. Мистер Элли объявил себя поклонником моей работы! Он был в аудитории во время моего выступления в Канзас-Сити в 1893 году и говорил кратко, но со знанием дела о магии.\n\nСудя по всему, эти двое работают в лаборатории одни.\n\nТесла, казалось, расслабился в моем обществе. Он расспрашивал меня об использовании электричества в Британии, о том, насколько широко оно распространяется. В конце концов его вопросы сосредоточились на мне, моей карьере, моем интересе к электричеству и на том, как я мог бы его использовать.\n\nЯ позволил ему направлять наш разговор, и в течение часа или двух он рассказывал мне о своих конфликтах с Эдисоном, о своей борьбе с бюрократией и научным истеблишментом и, самое главное, о своих успехах. Его нынешняя лаборатория финансировалась за счет работ последних нескольких лет. Он установил первый в мире электрогенератор размером с город, работающий на воде; электростанция находилась на Ниагарском водопаде, а городом-бенефициаром был Буффало, правда, Тесла сколотил свое состояние на Ниагаре, но, как и многие внезапно разбогатевшие люди, он задавался вопросом, как долго он сможет продержаться на том, что у него есть.\n\nКак можно мягче я поддерживал разговор о деньгах, потому что это одна из немногих тем, где наши интересы действительно совпадают. Между нами не обсуждалось ничего, что касалось бы непосредственно причины моего визита сюда, но в ближайшие дни для этого будет достаточно времени. Еще вчера мы только знакомились друг с другом и изучали интересы друг друга.\n\nЯ мало говорил о доминирующей черте его лаборатории. Во время долгого разговора нас заслонила громада его Экспериментальной Катушки. Действительно, можно сказать, что вся лаборатория-это Катушка, потому что там мало что есть, кроме регистрирующей и калибрующей аппаратуры.\n\nКатушка огромна. Тесла сказал, что его диаметр превышает пятьдесят футов. Построенная вокруг центрального сердечника (основания высокого металлического столба, который я видел, торчал из крыши), Катушка намотана вокруг многочисленных деревянных и металлических досок. Я не мог понять его замысла. Я понял, что он способен использовать или преобразовывать огромное количество электричества. Энергия для него отправляется в гору из Колорадо-Спрингс внизу; Тесла заплатил за это, установив городские генераторы сам!\n\n\"У меня есть все электричество, которое я хочу\"! - сказал он. \"Как вы, вероятно, найдете по вечерам\".\n\nЯ спросил, что он имеет в виду.\n\n- Вы заметите, что время от времени городские огни на мгновение тускнеют. Иногда они даже отключаются на несколько секунд. Это значит, что мы здесь работаем! Давай я тебе покажу\".\n\nОн вывел меня из здания и повел по неровной земле. Пройдя небольшое расстояние, мы подошли к месту, где склон горы круто обрывался, и там, далеко внизу, простирался весь Колорадо-Спрингс.\n\n-Если ты придешь сюда как-нибудь вечером, я тебе покажу, - пообещал он. \"Одним нажатием на рычаг я могу погрузить весь город во тьму\".\n\nКогда мы возвращались, он сказал: \"Вы действительно должны навестить меня как-нибудь вечером. Ночь-самое прекрасное время в горах. Это ошибка-смотреть вниз или вокруг. Настоящий интерес выше нас\"! - Он указал на небо. - Я никогда не знал такой чистоты воздуха, такого лунного света. И я никогда не видел таких бурь, какие случаются здесь! Я выбрал это место из-за частых штормов. В этот момент, как это бывает, приходит один\".\n\nЯ огляделся вокруг, но небо было голубым во всех направлениях.\n\n\"Гроза прибудет сегодня после семи вечера, в самом деле, давайте проверим мой когерер, по которому мы сможем определить точное время\".\n\nМы вернулись в лабораторию. Как только мы это сделали, я заметил, что Рэнди Гилпин и его экипаж прибыли и были припаркованы далеко от того места, где мы были. Рэнди помахал мне, и я помахал в ответ.\n\nТесла указал на один из приборов, которые я заметил ранее.\n\n- Это показывает, что шторм в настоящее время находится в районе Централ-Сити, примерно в восьмидесяти милях к северу от нас. Смотрите\"!\n\nОн указал на часть устройства, которую можно было увидеть через увеличительное стекло, и ткнул в нее пальцем в странные моменты. Посмотрев на него некоторое время, я увидел то, на что он пытался указать - крошечная электрическая искра пересекала видимый промежуток между двумя металлическими шипами.\n\n\"Каждый раз, когда он искрит, он регистрирует вспышку молнии\", - объяснил Тесла. \"Иногда я замечу здесь разряд, и более чем через час я услышу гром, грохочущий издалека\".\n\nТесла перешел к другому прибору и записал два или три показания. Я последовал за ним к нему.\n\n-Да,- сказал он. - Мистер Энджер, будьте так добры, посмотрите сегодня вечером на часы и отметьте момент, когда вы увидите первую вспышку молнии. По моим расчетам, это должно быть между 7: 15 вечера и 7: 20 вечера\".\n\n\"Вы можете предсказать точный момент\"? Я сказал.\n\n\"В течение примерно пяти минут\".\n\n- Тогда вы могли бы сделать свое состояние только на этом! - воскликнул я.\n\nОн выглядел безразличным.\n\n-Это периферия,- сказал он. \"Моя работа чисто экспериментальная, и моя главная забота-знать, когда разразится буря, чтобы я мог наилучшим образом использовать ее\". Он посмотрел туда, где его ждал Гилпин. - Я вижу, ваш экипаж вернулся, мистер Энджер. Вы собираетесь нанести мне еще один визит?\n\n- Я приехал в Колорадо-Спрингс только по одной причине, - сказал я. - Это для того, чтобы я мог сделать вам деловое предложение.\n\n-По моему опыту, это лучшее предложение, - серьезно сказал Тесла. - Я буду ждать вас послезавтра.\n\nОн объяснил, что сегодня собирается съездить на железнодорожную станцию, чтобы собрать еще кое-какое оборудование.\n\nС этими словами я удалился и вскоре вернулся с Гилпином в город.\n\nЯ должен отметить, что ровно в 7 часов 19 минут вечера в городе была видна вспышка молнии, за которой вскоре последовал раскат грома. Там тогда начался впечатляющий шторм.\n\n13 июля 1900 года.\n\nСегодня Тесла предложил мне прогуляться с ним.\n\n- Возможно, сейчас самое время спокойно обсудить дела. Могу я попросить подробнее рассказать о том, что вы имеете в виду?\n\n- Вот в чем я не совсем уверен ... - начал я и замолчал, пытаясь сформулировать слова.\n\n- Вы предлагаете вложить деньги в мои исследования?\n\n-Нет, сэр, не знаю, - смог сказать я. - Позвольте мне откровенно сказать, что я богатый человек, мистер Тесла. Надеюсь, я смогу вам помочь\".\n\n- Но не за счет инвестиций, как вы говорите.\n\n-Покупкой,- ответил я. \"Я хочу, чтобы вы построили мне электрический аппарат\".\n\n- Какой аппарат вам нужен? - сказал он. - Как вы видели, моя работа носит теоретический, экспериментальный характер. Ничего из этого не продается, и все, что я использую в настоящее время, бесценно для меня\".\n\n-Перед отъездом из Англии, - сказал я, - я прочитал в\" Таймс \"новую статью о вашей работе. В статье говорилось, что вы теоретически открыли, что электричество может передаваться по воздуху, и что вы планируете продемонстрировать этот принцип в ближайшем будущем. Многие из ваших научных коллег, по-видимому, говорили, что это невозможно, но вы уверены в том, что делаете. Было бы это правдой\"?\n\nЗадавая этот последний вопрос, я смотрел прямо в глаза Тесле и видел, что выражение его лица и жесты стали оживленными и выразительными.\n\n\"Да, это совершенно верно\"! - воскликнул он и тут же пустился в дикий и (для меня) совершенно непонятный рассказ о том, что он задумал.\n\nСуть его слов заключалась в том, что он давно установил, что наиболее эффективным способом передачи его многофазного электрического тока является повышение его до высокого напряжения и направление по кабелям высокого напряжения. Теперь он смог показать, что если бы ток был увеличен до еще большего напряжения, то он стал бы чрезвычайно высокой частоты, и никаких кабелей вообще не потребовалось бы. Ток будет послан, излучен, широко брошен в эфир, после чего с помощью серии детекторов или приемников электричество может быть снова захвачено и использовано.\n\nМы дважды обошли большой участок земли, и я не отставал от него.\n\nНаконец, я сказал: \"Скажите мне вот что: если электрическая энергия может передаваться, может ли физическая материя также передаваться из одного места в другое?\"\n\nТвердость его ответа удивила меня. Он сказал: \"Энергия и материя-всего лишь два проявления одной и той же силы. Неужто вы не понимаете этого\"?\n\n-Да, сэр,- ответил я.\n\n- Тогда ты уже знаешь ответ. Хотя я должен добавить, что не понимаю, почему кто-то должен желать передавать материю\".\n\n\"Но не могли бы вы сделать мне аппарат, который достиг бы этого\"?\n\n- Сколько массы будет задействовано? Какой там будет вес? Какого размера объект\"?\n\n-Не больше двухсот фунтов,- сказал я. - И размер... скажем, два ярда в высоту, не больше\".\n\n- Он пренебрежительно махнул рукой. - Какую сумму вы мне предлагаете?\n\n- Какую сумму вы требуете?\n\n- Мне отчаянно нужны восемь тысяч долларов, мистер Энджер.\n\nЭто было больше, чем я планировал, но все же это было в моих силах.\n\nЧерез несколько мгновений мы уже обнимались на ветреном плато, хлопая друг друга по плечам.\n\nКогда мы разошлись и крепко сжали руки, где-то в горах позади нас раздался громкий раскат грома и прокатился вокруг нас, грохоча и отдаваясь эхом в узких ущельях.\n\n14 июля 1900 года.\n\nСегодня Тесла более подробно расспросил меня о том, что я от него требую. Он не интересуется магическим эффектом, которого я планирую достичь, но вместо этого интересуется практическими аспектами. Размер аппарата, источник питания для него, вес, который он должен будет иметь, степень требуемой переносимости.\n\nЯ ловлю себя на том, что восхищаюсь его аналитическим умом. Переносимость была одним из аспектов, о котором я вообще не думал, но, конечно, это критический фактор для путешествующего мага.\n\nРеакция Теслы на мой проект окончательно убедила меня в том, о чем до сих пор я только подозревал. Борден не был в Тесле!\n\nЯ узнаю о своем старом сопернике. Через Оливию он пытался ввести меня в заблуждение. Его иллюзия использует своего рода яркие эффекты, которые обычные люди считают силой электричества, но на самом деле это не более чем яркие эффекты.\n\nНо Тесла работает медленно! Меня беспокоит течение времени. Я наивно полагал, что, как только я заказал Теслу, пройдет несколько часов, прежде чем он изготовит нужный мне механизм. По рассеянному выражению его лица, когда он бормочет что-то себе под нос, я вижу, что начал процесс изобретения, который, возможно, не имеет практического конца.\n\nУ меня есть твердые заказы в Англии на октябрь и ноябрь, и я должен быть дома задолго до первого из них.\n\n8 августа 1900 года.\n\nСегодня утром, по прибытии в лабораторию, Тесла сказал мне, что мой аппарат готов к демонстрации, и в состоянии сильного возбуждения я приготовился увидеть его. Однако когда дело дошло до этого, машина отказалась работать, и после того, как я более трех часов наблюдал, как Тесла возится с проводкой, я вернулся в отель.\n\n12 августа 1900 года.\n\nЕще одна неудачная демонстрация сегодня. Я был разочарован результатом. Тесла казался озадаченным, утверждая, что его расчеты не могут быть ошибочными.\n\nСбой кратко фиксируется. Прототип аппарата представляет собой уменьшенную версию его Катушки, с проводкой, устроенной по - другому. После продолжительной лекции о принципах (ни одного из которых я не понял) Тесла достал металлический стержень, который он или мистер Элли покрасили в характерный оранжевый цвет. Он поместил его на платформу, прямо под чем-то вроде перевернутого конуса проводов; вершина конуса была направлена прямо на стержень.\n\nКогда по указанию Теслы мистер Элли повернул большой рычаг, расположенный рядом с первоначальной Катушкой, раздался шумный всплеск электрического разряда. Почти сразу же оранжевый жезл был окружен бело-голубым огнем, который змеился вокруг него самым пугающим образом. Шум и свечение быстро нарастали, и вскоре казалось, что расплавленные частицы самого стержня брызгают на пол.\n\nЧерез несколько секунд Тесла резко взмахнул руками, Мистер Аллейн откинул рычаг управления, электричество мгновенно погасло, а стержень остался на месте.\n\nТесла сразу же погрузился в тайну. Мистер Элли рекомендовал мне держаться подальше от лаборатории в течение нескольких дней, но я остро ощущаю, что время уходит.\n\n18 августа 1900 года.\n\nСегодня, когда окрашенный в оранжевый цвет стержень больше не двигался, Тесла поднял его и предложил мне подержать. За несколько секунд до этого он был залит ярким светом, с искрами, летящими во все стороны. Я взяла его, ожидая, что он обожжет мне пальцы. Вместо этого было холодно. Вот что странно: она была не просто прохладной, в том смысле, что ее не нагревали, а активно холодной, как будто она была окружена льдом. Я взвесил жезл в руке.\n\n-Еще одна такая неудача, мистер Энджер, - сказал Тесла достаточно дружелюбным голосом, - и я, возможно, буду вынужден подарить вам это на память.\n\n-Я возьму его,- ответил я. \"Хотя я предпочел бы взять с собой то, что я пришел сюда, чтобы купить\".\n\n\"Если будет достаточно времени, я сдвину Землю\".\n\n- Время-это то, чего у меня не так много, - парировал я, бросая прут на пол. - И это не та Земля, которую я хочу сдвинуть. И не эта металлическая палка\".\n\n-Тогда назовите ваш любимый объект, - с сарказмом сказал Тесла. - Вместо этого я сосредоточусь на этом.\n\n-Мистер Тесла, - сказал я, - я хочу, чтобы он передал живое тело! Мужчина\"!\n\n- Значит, вы хотите, чтобы я продемонстрировал свои неудачи не на железном пруте, а на человеке? Кого вы назначаете для этого опасного эксперимента?\n\n\"Почему это должно быть опасно?\" Я сказал.\n\n\"Потому что все эксперименты рискованны\".\n\n\"Я тот, кто будет использовать это\".\n\n- Ты хочешь покориться! Сэр, мне потребуется остаток ваших денег, прежде чем я начну экспериментировать на вас!\n\n-Мне пора уходить, - сказал я и отвернулся, злясь. Я протиснулся мимо него и Аллеи и выбрался наружу. Рэнди Гилпина нигде не было видно, но я все равно зашагал прочь, решив, если понадобится, пройти весь путь до города пешком.\n\n-Мистер Энджер, сэр! Тесла стоял в дверях своей лаборатории. \"Давайте не будем обмениваться опрометчивые слова. Я должен был объяснить тебе все как следует. Если бы я знал, что вы хотите передавать живые организмы, вы не стали бы бросать мне такой вызов. Трудно иметь дело с массивными неорганическими соединениями. Живая ткань-это проблема другого порядка\".\n\n\"Что вы такое говорите, профессор\"? - спросил я.\n\n- Если вы хотите, чтобы я передал вам организм, пожалуйста, возвращайтесь сюда завтра. Это будет сделано\".\n\nЯ утвердительно кивнул и продолжил свой путь, ступая по рыхлому гравию тропинки, спускавшейся с горы.\n\nКогда я прошел около полумили, мое внимание привлекла яркая вспышка в высокой траве у дороги, и я остановился, чтобы посмотреть. Это был короткий железный стержень, выкрашенный в оранжевый цвет, по-видимому, идентичный тому, которым пользовался Тесла. Подумав, что, возможно, я все-таки сохраню память об этой необычной встрече с Теслой, я взял ее, и теперь она у меня с собой.\n\n19 августа 1900 года.\n\nСегодня, когда я пришел в лабораторию, Тесла сказал: \"Боюсь, я вас подведу. Предстоит еще много работы, и я знаю, как важно ваше возвращение в Британию\".\n\n\"Что случилось\"? - спросил я.\n\n- Я полагал, что с живыми организмами все будет просто. Структура намного проще, чем структура элементов. Жизнь уже содержит ничтожное количество электричества. Я работал в предположении, что все, что мне нужно было сделать, - это увеличить эту энергию. Я не знаю, почему это не сработало! Расчеты были точными. Приходите и сами увидите доказательства\".\n\nВ лаборатории я заметил мистера Аллея, который стоял, скрестив руки на груди. Рядом с ним на скамейке стояла маленькая деревянная клетка, в которой спал маленький черный кот с белыми усами и лапами.\n\n- Надеюсь, вы этого не допустите, мистер Энджер! - воскликнул Аллей. - Я принесла кошку моих детей, твердо пообещав, что она не пострадает. Мистер Тесла настаивает, чтобы мы подвергли это существо эксперименту, который, несомненно, убьет его\"!\n\nОн подвел меня к аппарату, который, как я сразу увидел, был полностью перестроен за ночь.\n\n\"Что происходит не так\"? - спросил я Теслу. - Вчера ты говорил так уверенно.\n\n- Я подсчитывал и пересчитывал десятки раз. Аллей тоже проверил математику. Это необъяснимая дихотомия между теоретическими и фактическими результатами. Такого со мной еще никогда не случалось\".\n\n- Могу я взглянуть на расчеты? Я сказал.\n\n- Конечно, можете, но если вы не математик, боюсь, они мало что вам скажут.\n\nОн и Элли выпустили большую книгу, в которой были выполнены его вычисления, и мы вместе долго изучали их. Тесла показал мне, насколько я мог понять, принцип, лежащий в их основе, и расчетные результаты. Я принял расчеты как должное и сконцентрировался на результатах, а затем неожиданный проблеск смысла прорезал меня.\n\n\"Вы говорите, что это определяет расстояние\"? Я сказал.\n\n\"Что это переменная. Для целей эксперимента я использовал значение в сто метров, но такое расстояние является академическим, так как, как вы видите, ничто из того, что я пытаюсь передать, не проходит вообще никакого расстояния\".\n\n\"А эта ценность здесь\"? - сказал я, указывая на другую линию.\n\n- Угол. Я пользовался точками компаса. Он будет направлен в любую из трехсот шестидесяти градусов от вершины энергетического вихря\".\n\n\"У вас есть установка для высоты\"? - спросил я.\n\n- Я им не пользуюсь. Пока аппарат не заработает полностью, я просто буду целиться в чистый воздух к востоку от лаборатории. Нужно быть осторожным, чтобы не вызвать повторную материализацию в положении, уже занятом другой массой! Может случиться что-то ужасное\".\n\nВдруг меня осенило вдохновение! Я выскочил из лаборатории и уставился на восток. Вернувшись в лабораторию, я сразу же направился к своему чемодану и вытащил железный прут, который нашел вчера вечером у тропинки. Я показал его Тесле.\n\n- Ваш экспериментальный объект, я полагаю? Я сказал.\n\n\"Да, это так\".\n\nЯ рассказал ему, где и когда я его нашел. Он поспешил к аппарату, где лежал его двойник. Он держал их вместе, и мы с Алли стояли рядом, удивляясь их одинаковому виду.\n\n- Эти следы, мистер Энджер! Тесла благоговейно вздохнул, легонько теребя крест-накрест аккуратно выгравированную на металле заплатку. - Я сделал их для того, чтобы с помощью идентификации доказать, что этот объект был передан через эфир. Но-\"\n\n\"Он сделал факсимиле самого себя\"! - сказал Аллей.\n\n- Где, вы сказали, вы нашли это, сэр? - потребовал Тесла.\n\nЯ вывел обоих мужчин наружу и объяснил, указывая вниз с горы. Тесла смотрел в молчаливом раздумье.\n\nЗатем он сказал: \"Мне нужно увидеть настоящее место! Покажи мне\"! В переулке он сказал: \"приведите теодолит, а в некоторых рулетка! Как только сможешь\"!\n\nИ с этими словами он зашагал по тропинке, схватив меня за плечо и умоляя показать ему точное место находки.\n\nВ конце концов я добрался до того места, где нашел жезл. Он находился точно к востоку от лаборатории. Тесла был явно удовлетворен и глубоко задумался, когда мы поднимались на гору в его лабораторию.\n\nЯ тоже думал, и как только мы снова оказались внутри, я сказал: \"Поскольку вы можете калибровать устройство, а не просто направлять свои эксперименты в воздух к востоку от нас, не могли бы вы отправить их на более короткое расстояние? Может быть, через саму лабораторию или снаружи, в районе, прилегающем к зданию?\n\n- Мы, очевидно, думаем одинаково, мистер Энджер!\n\nЯ никогда не видел Теслу таким веселым, и они с Элли немедленно принялись за работу. Я молча сел в дальнем конце лаборатории.\n\nПосле более длительного периода, чем я могу описать здесь, Тесла наконец сказал: \"Мистер Энджер, я считаю, что мы готовы\".\n\nКогда он вставил экспериментальный стержень и манипулировал своим рычагом, самый удовлетворительный удар сигнализировал об успешном завершении эксперимента. Мы втроем выбежали наружу, и действительно, там, на траве, лежал знакомый оранжевый железный прут.\n\nВернувшись в лабораторию, мы все осмотрели \"оригинал\". Он был холоден, как камень, но, несомненно, идентичен тому близнецу, который был сделан из него в пустоте космоса.\n\n-Завтра, сэр, - сказал мне Тесла, - завтра, с согласия моего благородного помощника, мы постараемся благополучно перевезти кота из одного места в другое. Если этого можно достичь, я полагаю, вы будете удовлетворены\"?\n\n-В самом деле, мистер Тесла,- тепло сказал я. \"Действительно\".\n\n20 августа 1900 года.\n\nИ действительно, это было сделано. Кот пересек эфир невредимым!\n\nПравда, возникла небольшая заминка, но Тесла обещает мне завтра еще одну демонстрацию, и на этот раз он сказал мне, что проблем больше не будет.\n\n11 октября 1900 года.\n\nКолдлоу-Хаус, Дербишир\n\nЯ не ожидал, что доживу до того, чтобы написать эти слова. После случайной смерти моего старшего брата Генри я наконец-то получил титул и земли моего отца.\n\nТеперь я постоянно живу в семейном доме и отказался от карьеры сценического иллюзиониста. Мой распорядок дня - управление поместьем.\n\nТеперь я подписываюсь сам,\n\nРуперт, 14-й граф Колдердейл.\n\n12 ноября 1900 года.\n\nЯ только что вернулся из поездки на несколько дней в мой старый дом в Лондоне. Я намеревался очистить это место и мою бывшую мастерскую и продать оба объекта на открытом рынке. Поместье Колдлоу находится на грани банкротства, и я спешу собрать немного денег для срочного ремонта как дома, так и некоторых зданий поместья. Естественно, я проклинал себя за то, что потратил на Теслу практически все накопленное за время моей сценической карьеры богатство. Покинув Колорадо и поспешно вернувшись в Англию с известием о смерти Генри, я отдал ему остаток гонорара. Тогда мне и в голову не приходило, как радикально изменится вся моя жизнь от этой новости.\n\nОднако возвращение в Идмистон-Виллас произвело на меня неожиданное впечатление. Конечно, он был полон воспоминаний, и они были настолько смешанными, насколько могут быть смешаны все подобные воспоминания, но прежде всего мне вспомнились мои первые дни в Лондоне. Тогда я был еще совсем мальчишкой, а потом встретил Джулию.\n\nНаконец я отправил записку на адрес Джулии. Скорее к моему удивлению, но к моему сильному удовольствию, она согласилась встретиться со мной, и два дня назад я провел день с ней и детьми в доме одной из ее подруг.\n\nДжулия, поначалу холодная и отстраненная, очевидно, была очень тронута моим потрясением и волнением (Эдвард, которому сейчас шестнадцать, такой высокий и красивый; Лидия и Флоренс такие красивые и нежные; я не могла оторвать от них глаз весь день!), и вскоре она заговорила со мной ласково и тепло.\n\nЗатем я поделился с ней своими новостями. Даже когда мы были женаты и жили вместе, я никогда не открывал ей своего прошлого, поэтому то, что я должен был сказать ей, было тройным сюрпризом. Во-первых, я должен был сказать ей, что когда-то покинул семью и поместье, о которых она никогда не слышала, во-вторых, что теперь я вернулся туда, и в-третьих, что я решил оставить свою сценическую карьеру.\n\nДжулия восприняла все это спокойно. Чуть позже она спросила меня, уверен ли я, что должен отказаться от своей карьеры. Я сказал, что не вижу альтернативы. Она сказала мне, что, хотя мы и расстались, она продолжала с восхищением следить за моей магической карьерой, сожалея лишь о том, что больше не является ее частью.\n\nПока мы разговаривали, я чувствовал, как во мне поднимается или, вернее, уходит отчаяние оттого, что я бросил свою жену и, что еще более непростительно, своих прекрасных детей ради американки.\n\nВчера, перед отъездом из Лондона, я встретился с Джулией во второй раз. На этот раз детей с ней не было.\n\nЯ просил у нее прощения за все грехи, которые совершил против нее. Я умолял ее вернуться ко мне и снова жить со мной как моя жена.\n\nОна сказала \"нет\", но пообещала, что тщательно все обдумает. Я не заслуживаю лучшего.\n\nПозже в тот же день я сел на ночной поезд до Шеффилда. Я не думал ни о чем, кроме примирения с Джулией.\n\n17 ноября 1900 года.\n\nДжулия сделала мне предложение о том, как мы могли бы быть вместе в будущем. Я должен принять простое решение.\n\nОна говорит, что вернется ко мне, снова будет жить со мной как моя жена, но только если я возобновлю свою магическую карьеру. Она хочет, чтобы я покинул Колдлоу-хаус и вернулся в Идмистон-Виллас. Она говорит, что она и дети не хотят переезжать в дом в отдаленной и для них неизвестной части Дербишира.\n\nЧтобы убедить меня, что ее предложение также для моего же блага, она добавляет четыре аргумента.\n\nВо-первых, она говорит, что сцена у нее в крови так же, как и у меня, и она хотела бы полностью участвовать во всех моих будущих сценических действиях.\n\nВ начале этого года, рассуждает она далее, я был на пике своей профессии, но по умолчанию несчастный Борден забирает мои лавры. По - видимому, он продолжает выполнять свою версию иллюзии переключения.\n\nЗатем Джулия напоминает мне, что единственный надежный способ заработать деньги-это заниматься магией, и что я обязан продолжать поддерживать ее, а также управлять семейным поместьем, которое она никогда не видела и о котором никогда не слышала до прошлой недели.\n\nНаконец, она указывает, что я не потеряю своего наследства, продолжая работать в Лондоне, и дом и все, что связано с поместьем, все еще будут ждать меня, когда придет время для выхода на пенсию. Срочные дела, такие как ремонт, можно решить из Лондона почти так же легко, как из дома.\n\nИтак, я вернулся в Дербишир, потому что мне нужно побыть одному и подумать.\n\n21 ноября 1900 года.\n\nЯ нахожусь в Идмистон Виллас, и я нашел здесь письмо от Элли, помощника Николы Теслы. Теперь я переписываю его:\n\n27 сентября 1900 года.\n\nМистер Энджер, сэр:\n\nЯ не думаю, что вы слышали, но Никола Тесла уже покинул Колорадо и, вероятно, сейчас находится в Нью-Йорке или Нью-Джерси. Его лаборатория была захвачена кредиторами, и в настоящее время она ищет покупателя.\n\nОднако в некоторых вопросах мистер Тесла-человек чести, и прежде чем наша работа здесь была закончена, ваше оборудование, как и было указано, было отправлено в вашу мастерскую.\n\nКак только аппарат будет правильно собран (я сам написал инструкцию по сборке), вы обнаружите, что он находится в полном рабочем состоянии и работает точно в соответствии с согласованной технической спецификацией. Устройство саморегулируется и должно продолжать работать без регулировки или ремонта в течение многих лет. Все, что вам нужно сделать, это держать его в чистоте и осветлять электрические контактные точки, если они станут тусклыми. (Мистер Тесла приложил к письму комплект запасных частей для тех деталей, которые в обычном порядке потребуют замены.)\n\nЯ, конечно, был бы очарован, узнав, какие иллюзии вы создаете с помощью этого необыкновенного изобретения, потому что я один из ваших величайших поклонников.\n\nПозвольте мне в заключение сказать, сэр, что я имел честь сыграть некоторую роль, пусть и небольшую, в создании этого аппарата для вас.\n\nИскренне ваш, Фэр хэм К. Аллея, Дип. Анг.\n\nПрочитав это, я поспешил в свою мастерскую. Я спросил соседей, не доставили ли из США большую посылку, но они ничего не знали.\n\n22 ноября 1900 года.\n\nСегодня утром я показал письмо Элли Джулии, совершенно забыв, что еще не рассказал ей о своей последней поездке в США и о том, что я там делал.\n\n- Так вот куда ушли все твои деньги? - сказала она.\n\n\"Да\".\n\n\"Что такого особенного в иллюзии\"? - спросила она.\n\n-Не сама иллюзия,- ответил я. \"Это средство, с помощью которого оно достигается\".\n\n- Мистер Борден имеет к этому какое-то отношение?\n\n- Я вижу, вы не забыли мистера Бордена.\n\n- Дорогая моя, нас разлучил Альфред Борден. У меня было много лет, чтобы поразмыслить, и я прослеживаю все, что пошло не так, начиная с того дня, когда он напал на меня\". Она говорила со спокойной яростью и без тени жалости к себе. - Если бы он не сделал мне больно, я бы не потеряла нашего первого ребенка. Тогда и началось твое беспокойство. Даже дорогие дети, которые последовали за ним, не смогли компенсировать жестокость и глупость того, что сделал Борден в тот день, и то, что вражда между вами продолжается, является доказательством того, что вы тоже должны чувствовать себя оскорбленными\".\n\n-Я никогда не говорил с тобой об этом, - сказал я. - Откуда ты знаешь?\n\n- Потому что я не дурак, Руперт, и я видел случайные замечания в магических журналах. Я не знал, что она продолжает подписываться на них. - Ты все еще главный среди моих забот,- сказала она. - Я только удивляюсь, почему вы никогда не говорили мне о его нападениях.\n\n- Потому что я, наверное, немного стыжусь этой вражды.\n\n\"Конечно же, он агрессор\"?\n\n-Мне пришлось защищаться,- сказал я.\n\nЯ рассказал ей о своих исследованиях его прошлого и попытках выяснить, как он создавал иллюзию. Затем я описал свои надежды на оборудование Теслы.\n\nДжулия была идеальной аудиторией для моих восторгов по поводу устройства Теслы, и в течение следующего часа или больше мы обсуждали все возможности, которые оно мне представляло.\n\nНаконец, Юля сказала, \"Почему бы нам не начать наш анализ почтовое отделение\"? Таким образом, два часа спустя мы обнаружили два огромных ящика, адресованных мне, в безопасности ожидающих в отделе мертвых писем Сортировочной конторы Маунт-Плезант.\n\n15 декабря 1900 года.\n\nАппарат Теслы был установлен в моей мастерской с тех пор, как я забрал его из Маунт-Плезант. Я репетировал.\n\nАппарат находится в полном рабочем состоянии и был изобретательно спроектирован для работы на всех известных в настоящее время вариантах электроснабжения. Это означает, что я могу путешествовать со своим шоу даже в Европу, США и (как утверждает Аллейн в своих инструкциях) на Дальний Восток.\n\nОднако я не могу выступать, если в театре нет электрического тока. В будущем мне придется проверить это, прежде чем принимать какие-либо новые заказы.\n\nВсе сценические иллюзии получают имена от своих изобретателей, и именно благодаря им они становятся известными в профессии. После некоторого раздумья я решил назвать изобретение Теслы Мигом, и благодаря этому оно станет известным.\n\nЯ также использую эту запись, чтобы отметить, что по состоянию на прошлый понедельник, 10 декабря, Джулия и дети вернулись и живут со мной в Идмистон Виллас. Они впервые увидят Колдлоу-Хаус, когда мы проведем там рождественские каникулы.\n\n31 декабря 1900 года.\n\nЯ пишу эти слова, когда девятнадцатый век подходит к концу. Через час я спущусь в нашу гостиную, где меня ждут Джулия и дети, и мы вместе увидим Новый год и Новый век.\n\nПоскольку секретность снова овладела мной, я должен сказать, что то, что мы с Хаттоном сделали сегодня вечером, должно было быть сделано.\n\nЭтим вечером, вскоре после наступления темноты, я сказал Джулии, что собираюсь сделать, и оставил ее ждать в гостиной.\n\nЯ нашел Хаттона, и мы вместе вышли из дома и направились через Восточную лужайку к фамильному склепу. Мы перевозили престижные материалы на ручной тележке, которую иногда использовали садовники.\n\nУ нас с Хаттоном были только штормовые фонари. Когда деревянный портал распахнулся, Хаттон заявил о своей тревоге. Я испытывал к нему невероятную симпатию.\n\n- Хаттон, я не ожидаю, что ты пойдешь на это. Если хотите, можете подождать меня здесь. Или ты можешь вернуться в дом, а я продолжу в одиночестве\".\n\n\"Нет, милорд\", - ответил он, в его честным путем. \"Я согласился на это\".\n\nОставив тележку у входа, мы рискнули войти внутрь. Внутренняя дверь была не заперта, но отодвинуть ее было трудно.\n\nРядом со мной заговорил Хаттон:\n\n\"Сэр, я должен собрать материалы престижа\"?\n\nЯ едва различал его черты в свете фонаря.\n\n- Да, я так думаю. Тебе нужна моя помощь?\"\n\n- Не могли бы вы подождать у подножия лестницы, сэр?\n\nОн быстро поднялся по ступенькам, и я понял, что он хочет покончить с этим как можно скорее.\n\nЗдесь, в этом месте, лежало большинство моих предков в ящиках и саванах.\n\nМеня терзали страхи. Мне хотелось последовать за Хаттоном на свежий воздух, но я понимал, что должен нырнуть еще глубже в подземелье. Я рациональный человек, который ищет объяснений и приветствует научный метод, но в те несколько секунд, когда Хаттон был далеко от меня, меня мучил легкий порыв нелогичного.\n\nНаконец я снова услышал, как он поднимается по ступенькам, волоча за собой первый из больших мешков с престижными материалами. Мне пришлось опустить фонарь, пока мы проносили мешок через дверь, а поскольку Хаттон оставил свой фонарь на тележке, мы работали почти в полной темноте.\n\nЯ сказал ему: \"Я глубоко рад, что вы здесь, чтобы помочь мне, Хаттон\".\n\n- Я понимаю это, милорд. Мне бы не хотелось делать это в одиночку\".\n\n\"Тогда давайте закончим его быстро\".\n\nНа этот раз мы вместе вернулись к тележке и вытащили второй большой мешок.\n\n-Мешки оставим здесь,- сказал я. \"Как далеко оторвались от пола насколько возможно. Завтра, когда рассветет, я снова приду сюда. С лучшим факелом\".\n\n- Я все прекрасно понимаю, сэр.\n\nНе говоря больше ни слова, мы быстро вернулись на поверхность и закрыли за собой наружную дверь. Я вздрогнул.\n\nВ холодном воздухе ночного сада мы с Хаттоном пожали друг другу руки.\n\n-Спасибо за помощь, Хаттон, - сказал я. - Я и понятия не имел, что там, внизу, будет так.\n\n- И я тоже, милорд. Вам еще что-нибудь понадобится от меня сегодня вечером?\n\nЯ задумался.\n\n- Не хотите ли вы и ваша жена присоединиться ко мне и леди Колдердейл в полночь? Планируем увидеть в Новом году\".\n\n- Благодарю вас, сэр. Для нас будет честью сделать это\".\n\nТак закончилась наша экспедиция. Хаттон потащил тележку к садовому сараю, а я пересек Восточную лужайку и, обойдя дом, направился к главному входу. Я пришел прямо в эту комнату, чтобы написать свой отчет, пока события были еще свежи.\n\nТеперь этот отчет написан, и время близится к полуночи. Настало время для меня найти свою семью и домочадцев для простой и знакомой церемонии, которая празднует конец одного года и, в данном случае, одного столетия, а затем приветствует в следующем.\n\n1 января 1901 года.\n\nЯ вернулся в хранилище и переместил престижные материалы в более выгодное положение.\n\n15 января 1901 года.\n\nИдмистон Виллы\n\nВчера аппарат Теслы вернулся из Дербишира, и с помощью Адама Уилсона я немедленно распаковал его и установил. Судя по моим часам, это заняло меньше пятнадцати минут. Мы должны быть уверены, что сделаем это в течение десяти минут, когда работаем в театре. В инструкции мистера Аллея говорится, что, когда они с Теслой проверяли его переносимость, они смогли установить все это менее чем за двенадцать минут.\n\nАдам Уилсон знает секрет иллюзии, как и должен. Адам работает на меня уже больше пяти лет, и я верю, что могу ему доверять. Чтобы быть как можно более уверенным, я предложил ему премию за конфиденциальность в размере десяти фунтов, которая будет выплачиваться в накопительный фонд на его имя после каждого успешного выступления. Они с Гертрудой ждут второго ребенка.\n\n14 февраля 1901 года.\n\nВчера я репетировал в мгновение ока дважды, а завтра повторю еще дважды. Я не осмеливаюсь сделать больше. Я буду исполнять его в субботу вечером в \"Трокадеро\" на Холлоуэй-роуд, а затем, по крайней мере, еще раз на следующей неделе. Я считаю, что если я смогу исполнять его достаточно регулярно, то лишние репетиции не понадобятся.\n\nТесла предупреждал меня, что будут последствия, и они действительно глубоки. Пользоваться аппаратом-дело не тривиальное. Каждый раз, проходя через него, я страдаю.\n\nВо-первых, это физическая боль. Мое тело разорвано на части, разобрано. За долю секунды мое тело превращается в электрические волны. Он излучается через пространство. Он вновь собирается в назначенном месте.\n\nХлоп! Я разбит на части! Хлоп! Я снова вместе!\n\nЭто сильный шок, который взрывается в каждой части меня, во всех направлениях. Миллионная доля секунды полной агонии! Вот как это ощущается.\n\nИ все же я прибываю в выбранное место, и я точно такой же, каким был миллионной долей секунды раньше. Я весь в себе и тождествен себе, но я в шоке от острой боли.\n\nВ первый раз, когда я воспользовался аппаратом Теслы в подвале Колдлоу-Хауса, без предупреждения о том, что мне предстоит испытать, я рухнул на пол в уверенности, что умер. Казалось невозможным, чтобы мое сердце, мой мозг могли пережить такой взрыв боли. У меня не было ни мыслей, ни эмоциональных реакций. Мне казалось, что я умер, и я действовал так, как будто умер.\n\nКогда я рухнул на пол, Джулия, которая, конечно же, была со мной во время теста, подбежала ко мне. Мое первое ясное воспоминание в мире после смерти-это ее нежные руки, тянущиеся к моей рубашке, чтобы нащупать признаки жизни. Я открыл глаза в шоке и изумлении, несказанно счастливый оттого, что нашел ее рядом, почувствовал ее нежность. Быстро мне удалось встать, чтобы успокоить ее, что мне было хорошо, чтобы обнять ее и поцеловать ее, чтобы быть самим собой еще раз.\n\nПо правде говоря, физическое выздоровление от этого жестокого опыта само по себе быстро, но психические последствия огромны.\n\nВ день первого испытания в Дербишире я заставил себя повторить его во второй половине дня, но в результате на большую часть рождественского периода был погружен в мрачнейшее уныние. Я умирал дважды. Я стал одним из ходячих мертвецов, проклятой душой.\n\nА напоминания о том, что я тогда сделал, - это материалы, которые потом пришлось убрать. Я даже не мог справиться с этой ужасной задачей до Нового года, как я уже описал.\n\nВчера здесь, в Лондоне, в электрическом блеске и знакомстве моей мастерской, с собранным заново оборудованием Теслы, я почувствовал, что должен пройти еще две репетиции. Я исполнитель, профессионал. Я должен придать очарование тому, что делаю. Я должен казаться волшебником, который успешно совершил невозможное.\n\nЯ должен с помощью тщательного искусства сделать свое чудо менее чудесным. Я должен выйти из передатчика стихий, как будто меня не разорвало на части, а снова соединило.\n\nПоэтому я старался научиться готовиться к боли, реагировать на нее, не падая, делать шаг вперед с поднятыми руками и с ослепительной улыбкой кланяться и отвечать на аплодисменты.\n\n17 февраля 1901 года.\n\nПрошлой ночью я благополучно пересек эфир со сцены Трокадеро в королевскую ложу. Оборудование работало отлично.\n\nМне удалось полностью скрыть шок от удара. Я могу сказать, что практика с аппаратом означала, что ужасный шок не так ужасен, как раньше, и что он становился немного лучше каждый раз, когда я пробовал его. Я могу предвидеть, что через месяц или около того я буду в состоянии переносить этот эффект с внешним безразличием.\n\nЯ также отмечаю, что последующее уныние, которое я испытываю, гораздо меньше, чем после моих первых попыток.\n\n2 марта 1901 года.\n\nВ Лондоне.\n\nВ моем ежедневнике записано тридцать пять подтвержденных заказов, принятых на следующие четыре месяца. Три из них предназначены для выступлений под моим собственным сценическим именем, и один из них будет называться \"Великие Дантоновские развлечения\".\n\nЯ буду скитаться по стране. Брайтон, Эксетер, Киддерминстер, Портсмут, Эйр, Фолкстон, Манчестер, Шеффилд, Аберистуит, Йорк-все это и многое другое встретит меня в моем первом туре, а также в самой столице, где у меня есть несколько свиданий.\n\nАгент уже говорит о зарубежных гастролях, возможно, с еще одной поездкой в США.\n\n10 июля 1901 года.\n\nЯ постоянно пересматривал и репетировал в мгновение ока в течение нескольких месяцев, и теперь это более или менее совершенное умение. Все мои прежние надежды на него сбылись. Я могу проходить сквозь эфир, не регистрируя никакой реакции на физические травмы, которые я переношу. Переход плавный, и с точки зрения зрителей объяснить его невозможно.\n\nПсихические последствия больше не являются проблемой. Я не страдаю ни от депрессии, ни от неуверенности в себе. Напротив (и я никому не доверяю этого и не записываю ни в какой другой документ, кроме этого секретного и запирающегося дневника), разрывание моего тела стало удовольствием, к которому я почти пристрастился. Поначалу меня приводили в уныние мысли о смерти, о жизни в загробной жизни, но теперь я каждую ночь переживаю свою передачу как возрождение, обновление себя. В первые дни я был обеспокоен тем, сколько раз мне придется выполнять трюк, чтобы сохранить его в практике, но теперь, как только я закончил одно представление, я начинаю жаждать следующего.\n\nТри недели назад, во время временного перерыва в моих занятиях, я установил оборудование Теслы в своей мастерской и сам прошел через этот процесс. Не для того, чтобы опробовать новые техники исполнения, не для того, чтобы усовершенствовать существующие, а исключительно для физического удовольствия от опыта.\n\nУтилизация престижных материалов, производимых на каждой выставке, все еще остается проблемой, но после всех этих недель мы разработали несколько процедур, чтобы работа выполнялась с минимумом суеты.\n\n3 сентября 1902 года.\n\nВ Лондоне.\n\nСудьбоносное откровение!\n\nВчера рано вечером, когда я отдыхал между спектаклями в театре Дейли в Ислингтоне, ко мне в дверь заглянул какой-то человек. Увидев его визитную карточку, я попросил немедленно проводить его в мою гардеробную. Это был мистер Артур Кениг, молодой журналист из \"Ивнинг Стар\", который дал мне столько пищи для размышлений о Бордене. Я не удивился, узнав, что г-н Кениг теперь занимает должность заместителя редактора новостей этой газеты. Он сердечно вошел и пожал мне руку.\n\n- Я только что видела ваш утренник, мистер Дантон! - сказал он. - Сердечно поздравляю вас. Признаюсь, я был в равной мере озадачен и развеселен\".\n\n-Рад это слышать, - сказал я и велел своему костюмеру налить мистеру Кенигу стаканчик виски. Когда с этим было покончено, я попросил костюмера оставить нас наедине и вернуться через пятнадцать минут.\n\n- Ваше здоровье, сэр! - объявил Кениг, поднимая бокал. - Или лучше сказать, милорд?\n\nЯ удивленно уставилась на него.\n\n- Откуда, черт возьми, ты об этом знаешь?\n\n- А почему ты думаешь, что я не должна? Известие о смерти вашего брата дошло до прессы обычным путем и было должным образом сообщено\".\n\n-Я видел эти отчеты, - ответил я. - Никто из них не упоминал обо мне.\n\n- Я думаю, это потому, что на Флит-стрит мало кто знает тебя лучше, чем по сценическому имени. Как истинный поклонник, я связал вас с Генри Энджером\".\n\n- От тебя ничего не ускользает, не так ли? Я сказал.\n\n- Не такая информация, сэр. Не волнуйся, я сохраню твой секрет. Полагаю, это секрет?\n\n- Я всегда разделял две части своей жизни. В этом смысле это секрет, и я был бы рад, если бы вы отнеслись к нему именно так\".\n\n- Даю вам слово, милорд.\n\n-Могу я спросить, - сказал я наконец, - чем обязан удовольствию этого визита?\n\n- Я пришел извиниться за мистера Бордена, вашего соперника. Признаюсь, что все мои изощренные теории о нем были ошибочны, в то время как ваша теория, грубая и простая, была верна\".\n\n-Я вас не понимаю,- сказал я.\n\n- Когда я приходил к вам в прошлый раз, я придерживался теории, что мистер Борден обладает большей магией, чем та, что существовала раньше.\n\n-Я помню, - сказал я. - Вы мудро убедили меня в этом. Я был тебе благодарен-\"\n\n- Однако у вас было более простое объяснение. Вы сказали, что Борден-не один человек, а двое. Близнецы, вы сказали. Однояйцевые братья-близнецы, каждый из которых занимает место другого по мере необходимости\".\n\n- Но ты доказал-\"\n\n- Вы были правы, сэр! Поступок мистера Бордена действительно основан на близнецах. Альфред Борден-это имя, слитое из двух: Альберта и Фредерика, братьев-близнецов, которые выступают вместе как один\".\n\n\"Это неправда\"! Я сказал.\n\n- Но это была ваша собственная теория.\n\n- Вы быстро вывели меня из заблуждения. У вас были доказательства-\"\n\n- Многое из этого оказалось фальсифицированным. Я был молодым репортером, еще не вполне освоившимся в своей профессии. С тех пор я научился проверять факты, перепроверять их, а затем проверять еще раз\".\n\n-Но я сам занимался этим делом, - сказал я. - Я изучил больничные записи о его рождении, список школы, в которой он учился. -\"\n\n-Фальшивые документы, мистер Энджер. Бордены построили свою жизнь вокруг поддержания этой иллюзии. Ничему в них нельзя доверять\".\n\n-Я провел самое тщательное расследование, - настаивал я. - Я знал, что есть два брата с такими именами, но один на два года младше другого!\n\n- Оба родились случайно в мае, насколько я помню. Не нужно много подделок, чтобы изменить запись о рождении с 8 мая 1856 года на 18 мая 1858 года\".\n\n\"Там была фотография двух братьев, снятая вместе\"!\n\n- Да, и его так легко найти! Это было оставлено как отвлекающий маневр для таких, как вы и я, чтобы наткнуться. Как и мы\".\n\n- Но оба брата были совершенно не похожи. Я сам видел портрет\"!\n\n- И я тоже. Действительно, у меня в кабинете есть его копия. Различие между их чертами лица поразительно. Но вы, конечно, понимаете обманчивое использование сценического грима\".\n\nЯ был ошеломлен этой новостью и уставился в пол, не в силах мыслить связно.\n\n- Вы в этом уверены? - потребовал я ответа. \"Абсолютно уверен\"? Кениг медленно кивнул. - Например, вы когда-нибудь видели двух братьев вместе?\n\n- Это основа моей уверенности. Всего один раз, да и то ненадолго, они встретились в моем присутствии\".\n\n\"Вы следили за ними\"?\n\n-Я следил за одним из них,- поправил меня Кениг. - Однажды августовским вечером я вышел из дома мистера Бордена. Он один вошел в Риджентс-парк. Я следовал за ним на расстоянии около ста ярдов. Когда он обошел Внутренний Круг, с противоположной стороны к нему подошел человек. Когда они встретились, они помолчали около трех секунд и заговорили вместе. Потом они пошли дальше, как и прежде. Однако теперь Борден нес небольшой кожаный чемоданчик. Человек, с которым он говорил, вскоре прошел мимо меня, и я увидел, что он очень похож на Бордена\".\n\nЯ задумчиво посмотрел на Кенига.\n\n- Откуда вы знаете, что человек, который шел дальше, тот, который сейчас нес чемодан, не был тем человеком, который говорил с Борденом? Он мог бы просто вернуться тем же путем, каким пришел. А если бы это было так, разве не тот Борден, за которым вы следили, прошел бы мимо вас?\n\n- Я знаю, что видел, милорд. Они были одеты по-разному, возможно, из-за хитроумного трюка, но этот факт позволил мне различить их. Они встретились, они прошли дальше, они были идентичны\".\n\nМой разум был сосредоточен. Я быстро размышлял о механике монтажа театрального магического представления. Если бы это было правдой, что они близнецы, то оба брата должны были бы присутствовать в театре на каждом спектакле. Это означало бы, что закулисный персонал неизбежно узнает секрет. Я уже знал, что Борден не боксирует на сцене, а за кулисами во время спектакля всегда болтаются люди, которые слишком много видят. Если бы действие Бордена было основано на однояйцевых близнецах, тогда, конечно, секрет просочился бы наружу много лет назад?\n\nВ противном случае, то чем объясняется? Могло быть только так, что секретность сохранялась до и после шоу. Что Борден-1, так сказать, прибудет в театр со своим аппаратом и реквизитом, а Борден-2 уже будет спрятан в одной из пьес. Борден-2 появлялся во время представления, в то время как Борден-1 прятался в реквизите на сцене.\n\nЭто было возможно, и если бы это было все, я мог бы принять это. Но у Бордена должна быть команда, работающая с ним: изобретатель, конечно, один или несколько помощников, которые появлялись на сцене, несколько носильщиков и оборотней, агент. Если все эти люди были посвящены в его тайну, то их способность молчать об этом была замечательной.\n\nС другой стороны, и это гораздо более вероятно, учитывая человеческую природу, если бы им не доверяли, Борден-1 и Борден-2 должны были бы заниматься сокрытием.\n\nПомимо этого, существовали повседневные реалии театральной жизни. Например, в те дни, когда шел дневной спектакль, что делал Борден-2 (тот, что прятался в аппарате) между показами? Будет ли он прятаться, пока его брат отдыхает в зеленой комнате с другими художниками? Выйдет ли он тайком, а потом будет прятаться один в гримерке, пока не придет время следующего шоу?\n\nКак они вдвоем входили в театры и выходили из них незамеченными? Менеджеры театральных дверей-ревнивые стражи пути. Всегда есть альтернативные пути в здание, через пейзажную бухту или перед домом, но опять же это предполагает необходимость постоянной секретности и подготовки, а также готовность мириться с немалым дискомфортом.\n\n- Я вижу, что дал вам пищу для размышлений, - сказал Кениг, прерывая ход моих мыслей.\n\n- На этот раз ты уверен в своих фактах? Я сказал.\n\n- Да, сэр. Честное слово\".\n\nЯ встал, давая понять, что беседа окончена.\n\nКениг взял шляпу и пальто и направился к двери, которую я придержал для него.\n\nЯ сказал ему как можно небрежнее: \"Вы не проявляете никакого любопытства по поводу того, как я выполняю свою собственную иллюзию\".\n\n- Я так понимаю, это магия, сэр.\n\n- Значит, вы не подозреваете, что у меня есть однояйцевый близнец?\n\n\"Я знаю, что у тебя нет\".\n\n-Итак, вы исследовали меня, - сказал я. - А как насчет Бордена? Ему интересно, как я добиваюсь эффекта?\n\nМистер Кениг широко мне подмигнул.\n\n- Я уверен, что он и его брат не хотели бы, чтобы вы знали, что они сгорают от любопытства к вам, сэр. Он протянул руку, и мы обменялись рукопожатием. - Еще раз примите мои поздравления. Если можно так выразиться, было приятно видеть вас в таком добром здравии\".\n\nОн ушел прежде, чем я успела ответить, но, кажется, я поняла, что он имел в виду.\n\n7 сентября 1902 года.\n\nМне уже кажется, что я буду занят с середины октября до марта или апреля следующего года. Мой предполагаемый доход от этих выступлений сделает меня богаче, чем самые смелые мечты моей юности. К концу следующего года мне, по всей вероятности, больше не придется работать.\n\nЭто подводит меня к объяснению прощального замечания Кенига.\n\nНесколько месяцев назад, когда я был в первом порыве совершенствования представления в мгновение ока, я подумал о новом окончательном повороте к иллюзии. Я устроил так, чтобы в конце моего выступления, после того как я пройду через эфир, я выглядел измученным. Казалось бы, магическая трансформация меня измотала. Я был бы человеком, который флиртовал со смертью, а теперь явил безошибочные следы.\n\nЭтот эффект стал рутинной частью моего действия. На протяжении всего моего шоу я двигаюсь осторожно, поворачиваюсь с легкой скованностью в талии и спине, хожу, сгорбив плечи. Когда опускается последний занавес, большинству зрителей кажется, что я недолго пробуду в этом мире.\n\nПомимо самого эффекта, у меня есть долгосрочная стратегия. Я планирую и готовлюсь к собственной смерти. В следующем году я хочу навсегда уйти со сцены. Я хочу освободиться от бесконечных гастролей, от долгих путешествий, от ночевок в театральных квартирах. Меня тошнит от необходимости держать в секрете то, что я делаю, и я всегда боюсь очередного витка нападок со стороны Бордена.\n\nНо самое главное-мои дети растут, и я хочу быть с ними, как они. Эдвард скоро уедет в университет, и девочки, без сомнения, скоро выйдут замуж.\n\nК этому времени в следующем году я буду, как я уже сказал, финансово независим, и при разумных инвестициях поместье Колдлоу сможет обеспечить мою семью на всю оставшуюся жизнь. Жизнь Великого Дантона, Руперта Энджера, придет к раковому концу, вызванному тяготами его карьеры, в какой-то момент осенью 1903 года.\n\nТем временем, без огласки или объявления, 14-й граф Колдердейл почти одновременно возьмет бразды правления своим наследством.\n\nТак объяснялось замечание Кенига о моем \"удивительном\" здоровье. Он проницательный человек и знает обо мне больше, чем мне хотелось бы.\n\nЯ много размышлял над его теорией о том, что существует не один Борден, а два. Я по-прежнему не уверен.\n\nЭто происходит из-за бесконечных осложнений жизни с обманом. А как же повседневная жизнь? Ни один артист не работает постоянно, какой бы успешной ни была его карьера. Бывают периоды отдыха, как добровольные, так и непроизвольные. Есть необходимые задержки между бронированиями. Бывают праздники, болезни, семейные кризисы.\n\nЕсли Борден-это не один человек, а двое, и один из них постоянно прячется, так что другой может показаться \"единственным\" Альфредом Борденом, то где и как он прячется? Что происходит в жизни скрытого человека, пока он прячется? Как он вступает в контакт со своим братом? Встречаются ли они когда-нибудь, и если да, то как они устраивают так, чтобы их никто не заметил?\n\nСколько еще людей знают об обмане, и как Борден может быть уверен, что тайна в безопасности у них?\n\nЕсли говорить о других людях, то как насчет жены Бордена? А как же его дети?\n\nЕсли Борден-это двое мужчин, они не могут быть ни мужем для жены, ни отцом для детей. Кто из них муж, кто отец? Жена Бордена-женщина хорошего происхождения и, судя по всему, не дура. Что она на самом деле знает о Бордене?\n\nНеужели ее держат в неведении относительно его истинной личности? Неужели она ничего не заподозрит, не заметит никакой разницы между этими двумя мужчинами?\n\nА как насчет личных шуток и наблюдений, общих личных воспоминаний, вопросов физической близости? Возможно ли, чтобы эти два человека сотрудничали до такой степени, что даже личные дела втягиваются в меры предосторожности и секретность, которые окружают простую сценическую иллюзию?\n\nТруднее поверить в обратное: жена Бордена знает правду и готова по какой-то причине мириться с этим. Это ситуация, полная нестабильности.\n\nОба эти объяснения настолько неправдоподобны, что я вынужден поверить в третье. Братья Борден намеренно не сказали жене правды и пытались обмануть ее, но она сама сделала обман несущественным. Другими словами, она разобралась в том, что происходит (как же она не могла?), но по каким-то своим причинам решила с этим согласиться.\n\nНесмотря на то, что эта теория содержит свои тайны, я нахожу ее наиболее разумным объяснением, но даже в этом случае все дело невероятно.\n\nЯ бы пошел на многое, чтобы защитить свои секреты, но я не позволю секретности стать навязчивой идеей. Может ли Борден и предполагаемый брат Бордена быть такими же одержимыми, какими их изображает Кениг?\n\nЯ все еще в раздумьях по этому поводу!\n\nВ конце концов, это не имеет значения, потому что трюк есть трюк, и каждый, кто его видит, знает, что происходит обман. Но Джулия ужасно страдала из-за этой вражды, и из-за нее моя собственная жизнь была чертовски близка к концу. Я считаю, что Борден-такой человек, который делает фетиш из своих секретов, и я имел несчастье связываться с ним.\n\nА также моя удача, как прямое следствие вражды, думать об иллюзии, которая делает мое состояние!\n\n30 апреля 1903 года.\n\nЯ велел Анвину продолжать принимать заказы до конца года и в первые месяцы 1904 года. Однако к концу сентября я умру. Вероятно, это произойдет в субботу, 19 сентября.\n\n20 мая 1903 года.\n\nЯ отменил оба моих выступления сегодня вечером, завтрашние под угрозой, и, набрасывая эти слова, я с нетерпением жду приезда Джулии.\n\nЯ дурак, проклятый, проклятый дурак!\n\nВчера вечером мое второе выступление было на полпути. Недавно я добавил в свой репертуар новый карточный трюк. При этом на сцену приглашается один из зрителей. Он берет карточку и пишет на ней свое имя. Я отрываю уголок карточки и отдаю ее добровольцу. Остальная часть карточки помещается в бумажный конверт, который поджигается. Когда пламя погасло, я достаю большой апельсин. Я разрезал его пополам, и оказалось, что в нем лежит подписанная карточка, а оторванный угол все еще, конечно, подходит.\n\nВчера вечером мой доброволец был, как мне показалось, местным жителем; он был высоким и сильным, с румяным лицом, и когда он заговорил, я услышал саффолкский акцент. Он сидел в центре первого ряда и предложил себя, как только я позвал кого-то на сцену. Это должно было предупредить меня о возможных неприятностях. Тем не менее, я начал делать трюк.\n\nКак я могла не догадаться, что это Борден?! Он даже дал мне ключ к разгадке, потому что имя, которое он написал на карточке, было Альф Редбоун, прозрачная почти анаграмма, но в своих мыслях я принял это за его настоящее имя.\n\nПокончив с карточным фокусом, я пожал ему руку, поблагодарил по имени и присоединил свои аплодисменты к аплодисментам публики, когда Эстер, моя нынешняя помощница, повела его к рампе партера.\n\nЯ не заметил, что место Редбоуна все еще пустовало несколько минут спустя, когда я двинулся к началу В Мгновение ока.\n\nЯ заметил его отсутствие, когда было уже слишком поздно; аппарат работал, и я должен был завершить трюк.\n\nНа этом этапе шоу ничего нельзя изменить. Даже выбранная мною целевая область фиксирована; установка координат слишком сложна и отнимает много времени, чтобы делать это в любое другое время, кроме как перед выступлением. Накануне вечером я настроил аппаратуру для обоих вчерашних представлений так, чтобы прибыть в самую высокую ложу на левой сцене, которая по договоренности с дирекцией оставалась пустой для обоих представлений. Ложа находилась примерно на той же высоте, что и главный балкон, и была видна почти из любой другой части зала.\n\nЯ устроил его так, чтобы материализоваться на самом поручне ложи, лицом вниз, в стойла, расположенные далеко внизу, и, по-видимому, изо всех сил стараясь сохранить равновесие. Во время первого представления все шло точно по плану, и мое магическое превращение вызвало крики тревоги в зале, сопровождаемые громовыми аплодисментами, когда я спустился на сцену на веревке, брошенной мне Эстер.\n\nЧтобы попасть на перила ложи лицом вниз к зрителям, я должен стоять внутри аппарата Теслы спиной к ложе. Зрители, конечно, не могут этого знать, но положение, в котором я располагаю свое тело, точно воссоздается в момент прибытия. Поэтому со своего места внутри аппарата я не мог видеть, куда я должен был прибыть.\n\nКогда Борден был где-то рядом, меня охватила ужасная уверенность, что он собирается снова саботировать меня! Что, если он прятался внутри ложи и толкнул меня, когда я подошел к выступу? Я почувствовал, как вокруг меня неотвратимо нарастает электрическое напряжение. Я не мог удержаться, чтобы не обернуться и не посмотреть на коробку. Я едва мог разглядеть его сквозь смертоносные бело-голубые электрические искры. Казалось, все в порядке; ничто не мешало моему приходу, и хотя я не мог заглянуть в саму ложу, где расположены сиденья, казалось, что там никого нет.\n\nНамерения Бордена были куда более зловещими, и мгновение спустя я понял, в чем дело. В тот самый момент, когда я повернулся, чтобы посмотреть на ложу, одновременно произошли две вещи.\n\nВо-первых, передача моего тела действительно началась.\n\nВо-вторых, электричество в аппарате отключили, мгновенно отключив ток. Голубые огни исчезли, электрическое поле погасло.\n\nЯ остался на сцене, стоя в деревянной клетке аппарата на виду у зрителей. Я смотрел через плечо на ложу.\n\nПередача была прервана! Но это началось прежде, чем было остановлено, и теперь я мог видеть свое отражение на перилах; там был мой призрак, мой двойник, на мгновение застывший в той позе, которую я принял, когда повернулся, чтобы посмотреть, наполовину изогнувшись, наполовину присев, глядя в сторону и вверх. Это была тонкая, невещественная копия меня самого, частичный престиж. Пока я смотрел, это мое отражение в тревоге выпрямилось, раскинуло руки и рухнуло навзничь в саму ложу!\n\nПотрясенный увиденным, я шагнул вперед из витков клетки Теслы. По сигналу включился прожектор, освещая всю ложу, чтобы выделить мою предполагаемую материализацию. Люди в зале посмотрели на ложу, уже наполовину ожидая подвоха. Они начали аплодировать, но шум стих. Смотреть было не на что.\n\nЯ стоял на сцене один. Моя иллюзия была разрушена.\n\n\"Занавес\"! - крикнул я за кулисы. \"Опустите занавес\"!\n\nНаконец техник услышал меня, и занавес опустился, отделяя меня от зрителей. Эстер появилась на бегу.\n\n\"Что случилось\"? - воскликнула она.\n\n- Тот человек, который вышел из зала! Где же он\"?\n\n- Я не знаю! Я думал, он вернулся на свое место\".\n\n- Он каким-то образом проник за кулисы! Вы должны позаботиться о том, чтобы эти люди покинули сцену\"!\n\nЯ сердито оттолкнул ее и приподнял ткань занавески. Пригнувшись, я шагнул под него и направился к рампе. В зале уже горел свет, и зрители медленно продвигались по проходам к выходам. Люди были явно озадачены, но больше не обращали внимания на сцену.\n\nЯ посмотрел на коробку. Прожектор был выключен, и я ничего не видел.\n\nЖенщина вскрикнула раз, другой. Она была где-то в здании за логами.\n\nЯ быстро прошел за кулисы и встретил Уилсона, который спешил на сцену, чтобы найти меня. Я приказал ему как можно быстрее разобрать и упаковать аппарат. Я пронесся мимо него и добрался до лестницы, ведущей на балкон и лоджию. Зрители уже спускались вниз, и когда я начал подниматься по лестнице, то лавировал между ними.\n\nКаждый мой шаг становился все труднее. У меня перехватило дыхание, а сердце колотилось так, словно я только что пробежала милю в гору. Я всегда поддерживал себя в форме, и физические упражнения никогда не были для меня большой нагрузкой, но внезапно я почувствовал себя слабым и полным. К тому времени, когда я был на вершине только первого короткого пролета лестницы, я не мог идти дальше. Я отдохнул несколько секунд, а затем начал подниматься по следующей лестнице.\n\nНе успел я сделать и двух шагов, как меня охватил ужасающий кашель. Сердце бешено колотилось, кровь ритмично стучала в ушах, пот лился градом. Я не мог устоять на ногах и рухнул вперед по каменным ступеням, в то время как последние зрители проходили мимо, их сапоги были всего в нескольких дюймах от моей головы.\n\nВ конце концов Уилсон нашел меня. Он поднял меня на руки и держал, как ребенка, пока я пыталась восстановить дыхание.\n\nНаконец мое сердце и дыхание успокоились, и меня охватил сильный озноб.\n\nНаконец мне удалось сказать: \"Ты видел, что случилось?\"\n\n-Альфред Борден, должно быть, ушел за кулисы, сэр.\n\n- Только не это! Я имею в виду, что произошло, когда отключилось электричество?\n\n- Я управлял коммутатором, мистер Энджер. Как обычно\".\n\nМесто Уилсона во время \"В мгновение ока\" находится в задней части сцены, невидимое для зрителей, потому что он скрыт задней тканью экранизационной коробки. Хотя он в каждый момент соприкасается с тем, что я делаю, на самом деле он не может видеть меня большую часть иллюзии.\n\nЯ описал призрачный престиж самого себя, который мельком видел. Уилсон, казалось, был озадачен, но тут же предложил подбежать к самой ложе. Он так и сделал, а я беспомощно и неловко лежал на холодных голых ступеньках. Когда он вернулся через минуту или две, Уилсон сказал мне, что ничего там не видел.\n\nОн сказал, что сиденья в верхней ложе были разбросаны по ковровому покрытию, но в остальном в этом не было ничего необычного. Я должен был принять его слова; я узнал, что Уилсон-острый и надежный помощник.\n\nОн помог мне спуститься по лестнице и снова выйти на сцену. К этому времени я уже достаточно оправился, чтобы стоять без опоры.\n\nЯ должен был выбросить этот вопрос из головы. Гораздо большую тревогу вызывал тот факт, что я внезапно стал физически недееспособным. Каждое движение было напряженным, и кашель, казалось, взрывно свернулся в моей груди, готовый вырваться снова в любой момент.\n\nУилсон нанял кэб, благополучно доставил меня в отель и тотчас же послал записку Джулии. Вызвали врача, и когда он приехал, то осмотрел меня и заявил, что не нашел ничего подозрительного. Мне было очень трудно заснуть, но в конце концов я заснул.\n\nСегодня утром я проснулась, чувствуя себя сильнее, и спустилась вниз без посторонней помощи. Уилсон ждал меня в вестибюле отеля с известием, что Джулия прибудет в полдень. Тем временем он заявил, что я плохо выгляжу, но я настаивал, что начал поправляться. После завтрака, однако, я понял, что у меня мало сил.\n\nНеохотно я отменил оба сегодняшних спектакля, и пока Уилсон был в театре, я написал этот отчет о том, что произошло.\n\n22 мая 1903 года.\n\nВ Лондоне.\n\nПо настоянию Джулии и по совету Уилсона я отменил оставшуюся часть бронирования Лоустофта.\n\nГлубоко в моем сердце живет тайный страх. Короче говоря, мое плохое здоровье может означать, что я никогда больше не смогу выступать. После нападения Бордена на меня я стал почти инвалидом.\n\nМеня осматривали три врача. Все они говорят, что я здоров и не проявляю явных симптомов болезни. Я жалуюсь на свое дыхание, поэтому они слушают мою грудь и прописывают свежий воздух. Я говорю им, что мое сердце колотится, когда я поднимаюсь по лестнице, и они слушают мое сердце, и они говорят мне быть осторожным в том, что я ем, и принимать вещи легче. Я говорю, что легко устаю, и они советуют мне отдохнуть.\n\nЯ взвесился, и результат оказался поразительным. Я похудела почти на тридцать фунтов! Большую часть своей взрослой жизни я весил более или менее ровно сто шестьдесят восемь фунтов. Сегодня утром я обнаружил, что вешу чуть больше ста тридцати девяти фунтов!\n\nВ зеркале я выгляжу так же, как всегда. Я действительно выгляжу усталым, но я не похож на человека, который не может подняться на короткий лестничный пролет, не задыхаясь на полпути.\n\nНет никакой нормальной или логической причины для этого; это, должно быть, было вызвано неполной передачей Теслы. Электрическая информация была отправлена лишь частично. Вмешательство Бордена помешало полной сборке.\n\nИ снова его вмешательство привело меня на грань смерти!\n\nПозже.\n\nНа ходу меня охватила мысль, последствия которой я до сих пор обдумываю.\n\nВ тайне этих страниц позвольте мне сообщить, что всякий раз, когда я использовал аппарат Теслы, будь то на спектакле или на репетиции, я всегда старался спрятать в карман две или три золотые монеты. Почему я должен это сделать, должно быть самоочевидно; мое недавнее приобретение финансового состояния не только связано с гонорарами за исполнение!\n\nТесла, по совести говоря, предостерегал меня от такого поступка. Он высоконравственный человек и долго читал мне лекции о подделках. Он сказал, что у него также есть научные причины, что аппарат был откалиброван для моего известного веса тела (с определенными запасами прочности), и что присутствие около моей персоны небольших, но массивных предметов, таких как золотые монеты, может сделать проекцию неточной на больших расстояниях. Однако у меня никогда не было проблем с неточностью, о которых предупреждал Тесла, возможно, потому, что расстояния, которые я преодолеваю, так коротки.\n\nСегодня днем я искал три монеты, которые носил в кармане во вторник вечером. Как только я взял их в руки, я почувствовал, что они весят меньше, чем раньше, и когда я взвесил их, я обнаружил, что они действительно легче.\n\nЯ подсчитал, что они тоже потеряли около семнадцати процентов своей массы. Они выглядят так же, но немного похудели.\n\n18 июля 1903 года.\n\nВ Дербишире.\n\nВеликий Дантон мертв. Смерть иллюзиониста Руперта Энджера наступила в результате травм, полученных в результате неудачного трюка во время представления в театре \"Павильон\" в Лоустофте. Он умер в своем доме в Хайгейте, Лондон, оставив вдову и троих детей.\n\n14-й граф Колдердейл остался жив. Он испытывал смешанное удовольствие, читая свой собственный некролог в \"Таймс\", привилегия, не предоставленная многим.\n\nДела Энджера теперь находятся в руках адвокатской конторы. Он, конечно, действительно мертв, и его тело действительно было помещено в гроб. Я видел в этом последнюю иллюзию Энджера: он сам приготовил свой труп для погребения. Джулия официально его вдова, а дети-сироты. Все они присутствовали на Хайгейтском кладбище на его похоронах, церемония была строго соблюдена его ближайшими родственниками. Пресса держалась в стороне по личной просьбе вдовы, и в этот день не было видно ни поклонников, ни поклонниц.\n\nВ тот же день я сам возвращался анонимно в Дербишир с Адамом Уилсоном и его семьей. Он и Гертруда согласились остаться со мной в качестве платных компаньонов. Я могу хорошо вознаградить их.\n\nДжулия с детьми вернулась сюда через три дня. Пока она вдова Энджер, но когда мы исчезнем из памяти людей, она потихоньку станет, как и положено, леди Колдердейл.\n\nПосле неприятного шока от того, что случилось со мной в Лоустофте, я свыкся с тем, что стало моим новым существованием. Я не в упадке, и мое состояние остается стабильным. У меня мало физической энергии и сил, но я не собираюсь внезапно падать замертво. Здешний врач повторяет то, что мне говорили в Лондоне: хорошая еда, физические упражнения и позитивный настрой в конце концов вылечат меня.\n\nЯ попросил Уилсона установить аппарат Теслы в подвале, сказав ему, что время от времени буду репетировать, готовясь к возвращению на сцену. Его реальная польза, конечно, в другом.\n\n15 декабря 1903 года.\n\nАдам Уилсон пришел ко мне в читальный зал в половине одиннадцатого утра и сообщил, что внизу меня ждет посетитель. Это был Артур Кениг!\n\nЯ попросила Адама привести его.\n\nКениг был в серьезном настроении. После того как мы поздоровались, я усадил его в одно из мягких кресел напротив моего стола. Первым делом он заверил меня, что его визит никак не связан с работой в газете.\n\n-Я здесь в качестве эмиссара, милорд, - сказал он. - Я действую в моем личном качестве для третьей стороны, которая знает о моем интересе к миру магии и которая попросила меня обратиться к вашей жене.\n\n\"Подойти к Джулии\"? - спросил я с искренним удивлением. - Почему ты должен ей что-то говорить?\n\nКениг явно чувствовал себя неловко.\n\n- Ваша жена, милорд, вдова Руперта Энджера. Именно в этом обличье мне было поручено приблизиться к ней. Но я подумал, что, принимая во внимание то, что произошло в прошлом, было бы разумнее сначала прийти к вам\".\n\n- Что происходит, Кениг?\n\nОн принес с собой небольшой кожаный футляр, взял его и положил на колени.\n\n- Третья сторона, от имени которой я выступаю, наткнулась на записную книжку, личные мемуары, в которых, как мне кажется, заинтересована ваша жена. В частности, есть надежда, что леди Колдердейл, то есть миссис Энджер, захочет купить его. Эта, э-э, третья сторона не знает, что вы, милорд, все еще живы, и поэтому я обнаруживаю, что предаю не только человека, который посылает меня на это задание, но и человека, с которым я должен говорить. Но в данных обстоятельствах я действительно чувствовал-\"\n\n\"Чья это тетрадь?\"\n\n\"Альфред Борден\".\n\n\"Есть ли у вас это с тобой\"?\n\n\"Конечно, хочу\".\n\nКениг сунул руку в футляр и извлек оттуда блокнот в матерчатом переплете, вроде тех, что снабжены запирающейся застежкой. Он протянул ее мне, чтобы я мог осмотреть ее, но так как она была заперта, я не мог видеть, что внутри. Когда я снова посмотрел на Кенига, он держал в руке ключ: \"Мой... клиент требует пятьсот фунтов, сэр\".\n\n\"Это подлинное\"?\n\n\"Несомненно\".\n\n- Но стоит ли она пятьсот фунтов?\n\n- Я подозреваю, что вы сочтете, что он стоит гораздо больше. Она написана собственноручно Борденом и имеет прямое отношение к тайнам его магии. Намекается на сокрытие жизни близнецов. Я нашел это очень интересным чтением, и я могу гарантировать, что вы тоже будете\".\n\nЯ повертел книгу в руках, размышляя об этом.\n\n- Кто ваш клиент, Кениг? Кому нужны деньги?\" Он выглядел встревоженным, явно не привыкшим к подобным вещам.\n\n- Милорд, я подозреваю, что вы не слышали главной новости, которую я принес. Вам известно, что Борден недавно умер? Без сомнения, мое удивленное выражение лица дало ему нужный ответ. - Если быть точным, я полагаю, что один из двух братьев мертв.\n\n-Ты говоришь неуверенно,- сказал я. \"Почему\"?\n\n- Потому что нет убедительных доказательств. Мы оба знаем, как одержимо Бордены скрывали свою жизнь, поэтому неудивительно, что оставшийся в живых сделает то же самое, когда другой умрет. По следу было трудно идти\".\n\n- Тогда откуда ты вообще об этом знаешь? О, я вижу эту третью сторону, которая поручила вам\".\n\n\"И есть косвенные доказательства\".\n\n\"Например\"? - подсказал я.\n\n\"Знаменитая иллюзия больше не входит в акт профессора\".\n\n- Для этого может быть много причин,- заметил я. \"Я был на его шоу несколько раз, и он не всегда включает этот трюк\".\n\n\"На самом деле нет. Но это, скорее всего, потому, что оба брата обязаны его выполнять\".\n\n- Думаю, вам следует назвать мне имя вашего клиента, Кениг.\n\n- Милорд, кажется, вы когда-то знали американку по имени Олив Уэнскомб?\n\nЯ вспомнил, что Оливия взяла девичью фамилию своей матери, когда подошла к Бордену.\n\n-По причинам, которые вы наверняка понимаете, - сказал я, - я никогда не говорю о мисс Свенсон.\n\n- Да, да. И я прошу прощения за то, что упомянул ее. Однако она глубоко увязла в деле с записной книжкой. Насколько я понимаю, мисс Уэнскомб, или Свенсон, как вы ее знали, служила у вас несколько лет назад, но дезертировала в лагерь Борденов. Какое-то время она работала ассистенткой Бордена, но недолго. Вы потеряли с ней связь, я думаю, примерно в это же время\".\n\nЯ подтвердил, что это так.\n\n-Оказывается, - продолжал Кениг, - близнецы Борден владеют тайным убежищем в Северном Лондоне. Если быть точным, это анфилада комнат в зажиточной части Хорнси, и именно здесь один из братьев жил инкогнито, в то время как другой наслаждался домашним комфортом в Сент-Джонс-Вуде. Они регулярно чередовались. После нее... Мисс Уэнскомб поселилась в квартире Хорнси и с тех пор живет там. И будет продолжать это делать, если судебное разбирательство против нее провалится\".\n\n\"Слушания\"?\n\nМне было трудно воспринимать всю эту информацию сразу. - Ей вручили уведомление об увольнении за неуплату арендной платы, и она должна покинуть квартиру на следующей неделе. Как иностранная гражданка, не имеющая постоянного места жительства, она столкнется с депортацией. Именно по этим причинам она обратилась ко мне, зная о моем интересе к мистеру Бордену. Она думала, что я смогу ей помочь.\n\n\"Продолжайте\".\n\n- Вам будет интересно узнать, что мисс Уэнскомб не знала о существовании двух братьев и по сей день отказывается верить, что ее обманули.\n\n- Я сам однажды спрашивал ее об этом, - сказал я, вспоминая мрачную беседу с ней в театре в Ричмонде. - Тогда она сказала, что Борден-всего лишь один человек. Она знала о моих подозрениях. Но сейчас я с трудом в это верю\".\n\n- Брат Бордена, который умер, заболел в квартире Хорнси. Похоже, у него случился сердечный приступ. Мисс Уэнскомб вызвала врача Бордена, и после того, как тело увезли, приехала полиция. Когда она сказала им, кто был убитый, они ушли, чтобы продолжить расследование, но так и не вернулись. Позже она связалась с доктором и обнаружила, что он недоступен. Его помощник сказал ей, что мистер Борден заболел, но быстро поправился и только что выписался из больницы! Поскольку мисс Уэнскомб была с ним, когда он умер, она не могла в это поверить! Она снова обратилась в полицию, но, к ее удивлению, они тоже подтвердили это.\n\n- Я слышала все это от самой мисс Уэнскомб. Теперь, судя по тому, что она мне рассказала, она понятия не имеет, что Борден вел второй дом. По ее мнению, Борден проводил с ней почти все дни и ночи, и она всегда знала, где он бывает в другое время. Итак, Борден внезапно умер, и она была потрясена и расстроена, как и любой человек в ее положении, но у нее не было причин полагать, что в этом будет что-то необычное! И он, конечно, умер, по ее словам. Она говорит, что провела с телом больше часа, прежде чем приехал доктор, и к тому времени оно уже остыло. Доктор осмотрел тело достаточно, чтобы подтвердить смерть, и сказал, что подпишет свидетельство о смерти по возвращении в операционную. Однако теперь она столкнулась не только с отрицаниями всех причастных, но и с неопровержимым фактом, что Альфред Борден появляется на публичной сцене, исполняя свою магию, и явно не мертв\".\n\n- Если она думает, что Борден был всего лишь одним мужчиной, то как она это объясняет? - воскликнул я.\n\n- Я, конечно, спросил ее. Как вы знаете, ей не чужд мир иллюзий. Она сказала мне, что после долгих размышлений пришла к печальному выводу, что Борден использовал магические приемы, чтобы инсценировать свою смерть, например, проглотил какое-то лекарство, и что все это было тщательно продуманной шарадой, чтобы позволить ему уйти от нее\".\n\n- Вы сказали ей, что Бордены-близнецы?\n\n- Да. Она посмеялась над этой мыслью и заверила меня, что если женщина живет с мужчиной пять лет, то она знает о нем все. Она категорически отвергла мысль о том, что их могло быть двое\".\n\n-Значит, эта тетрадь внезапно появилась, чтобы решить все ее проблемы, - сказал я.\n\nКениг задумчиво посмотрел на меня, потом сказал: - Не все, но самые близкие. Милорд, я думаю, что в качестве жеста моей доброй воли я должен позволить вам изучить тетрадь без обещания оплаты\".\n\nОн передал мне ключ и откинулся на спинку стула, пока я открывал замок.\n\nЗаписная книжка была написана крошечным почерком, аккуратно вписанным в правильные и ровные строки, но на первый взгляд не разборчивым. Инстинкт чародея подсказывал мне, что надо быть настороже и не поддаваться на уловки Бордена. Все эти годы вражды показали степень его готовности причинить мне боль или вред. Я пролистал тетрадь примерно на половину толщины, когда остановился. Я уставился на него, глубоко задумавшись.\n\nБолее чем возможно, что это была самая изощренная атака Бордена на меня. История Кенига об Оливии, смерть Бордена в ее квартире, случайно обнаруженная тетрадь с самыми ценными профессиональными секретами Бордена-все это могло быть сфабриковано.\n\nМне оставалось только слово Кенига. Что бы на самом деле содержал блокнот, если бы это был еще один трюк? Запутанный лабиринт обманов, который манипулировал бы мной, чтобы заставить меня ответить неправильно? Может ли здесь быть что-то такое, что в лице Оливии Свенсон поставит под угрозу мою единственную оставшуюся область стабильности, а именно мой чудесным образом восстановленный брак с Джулией?\n\nМне казалось, что я подвергаю себя опасности, даже держа в руках блокнот.\n\nГолос Кенига прервал мои мысли.\n\n- Осмелюсь ли я предположить, милорд, что могу догадаться, о чем вы думаете?\n\n-Нет, вы не можете так предполагать, - сказал я.\n\n-Вы сомневаетесь во мне, - настаивал Кениг. - Вы думаете, что Борден заплатил мне или каким-то образом надавил на меня, чтобы я принес это вам. Так ли это\"? Я ничего не ответил, все еще держа блокнот полуоткрытым и уставившись на него.\n\n-Есть способы расследовать то, что я вам рассказываю, - продолжал Кениг. - Судебный иск против мисс Уэнскомб, поданный хозяином квартиры в Хорнси, рассматривался в суде Хэмпстеда месяц назад. Вы можете сами ознакомиться с судебными протоколами. В Уиттингтонском госпитале есть записи Алмонера, в которых говорится, что в день смерти мисс Уэнскомб была обнаружена неопознанная жертва сердечного приступа, возраст и внешность которой совпадали с внешностью Бордена. Есть также запись, что этот труп был удален местным врачом в тот же день\".\n\n- Кениг, десять лет назад ты послал меня по следу ложных улик, - сказал я.\n\n- Да, действительно. Я никогда не переставал сожалеть об этом и уже говорил вам, что моя преданность вашему делу является результатом этой ошибки. Даю вам слово, что тетрадь подлинная, что обстоятельства, при которых она попала ко мне, таковы, как я описал, и что, кроме того, оставшийся в живых брат Борден отчаянно пытается вернуть ее\".\n\n\"Как это ускользнуло от него?\" Я сказал.\n\n- Мисс Уэнскомб осознала его потенциальную ценность, возможно, как нечто, что может быть опубликовано в виде книги. Когда ей срочно понадобились деньги, она подумала, что они могут оказаться более ценными для вас или, как она поняла из недавних событий, для вашей вдовы. Естественно, тетрадь она прятала. Сам Борден не может обратиться к ней за этим, но, конечно, не случайно десять дней назад в ее квартиру ворвались насильно и обыскали. Ничего не было взято. Эта записная книжка, которую она спрятала в другом месте, осталась у нее\".\n\nЯ открыл блокнот, на котором лежал мой палец. Как будто Борден навязал мне эту страницу.\n\nОстальная часть предложения гласила: \"Вот настоящая причина, по которой Энджер никогда не разгадает всю тайну, если я сам не дам ему ответа\".\n\n- Вы говорите, она хочет пятьсот фунтов?\n\n\"Да, Господь мой\".\n\n\"Она получит его\".\n\n19 декабря 1903 года.\n\nВизит Кенига утомил меня, и вскоре после того, как он уехал (с шестьюстами фунтами, излишек был частично за его хлопоты на сегодняшний день, а частично за его молчание и отсутствие с тех пор) Я улегся в постель и оставался там до вечера. Тогда я написал свой отчет об этом, но на следующий день и на следующий день я был слишком слаб, чтобы пытаться больше, чем немного есть и много спать.\n\nВчера мне наконец удалось прочесть кое-что из записной книжки Бордена. Как и предсказывал Кениг, я нашел книгу интересной.\n\nЯ показываю отрывки Джулии, которая находит их не менее интересными. Она реагирует больше на его самодовольный тон, чем я, и убеждает меня не сжигать свою драгоценную энергию, снова рассердившись на него.\n\nСамое удивительное, что у меня наконец-то есть доказательство того, что Альфред Борден был плодом заговора между близнецами. Нигде они в этом не признаются, но записная книжка явно работа двух рук.\n\nОни обращаются друг к другу в первом лице единственного числа. Поначалу это сбивало меня с толку, как, возможно, и предполагалось, но когда я указал на это Джулии, она заметила, что тетрадь явно не предназначалась для чтения кем-либо еще.\n\nЭто предполагает, что они называют друг друга \"я\" по привычке, а это, в свою очередь, подразумевает, что они делали это большую часть своей жизни. Читая между строк записной книжки, как я и должен, я понимаю, что каждое событие или событие в их жизни было одним коллективным опытом. Это похоже на то, как если бы они всю свою жизнь с детства готовились к иллюзии, где один тайно займет место другого. Он одурачил меня и одурачил большую часть зрителей, которые видели их в спектакле, но, конечно, в конце концов именно Борден-дурак.\n\nДве жизни, превращенные в одну, означают сокращение этих жизней вдвое. В то время как один живет в мире, другой скрывает, буквально не существует, скрытый дух, престиж.\n\n26 марта 1904 года.\n\nЯ был серьезно болен. Симптомы были ужасающими: постоянная тошнота и рвота, паралич правой ноги, изъязвленный рот и почти непреодолимая боль в нижней части спины. Излишне говорить, что большую часть времени я провел в больнице в Шеффилде.\n\nТеперь, однако, произошло небольшое чудо, и я, по-видимому, иду на поправку. Язвы исчезли, не оставив и следа, я начинаю чувствовать, а значит, и движение в ноге, и общее ощущение боли и болезни отступает. Всю последнюю неделю я провел дома, и хотя я был прикован к постели, настроение у меня с каждым днем все больше поднималось.\n\nСегодня я встал с постели. Я в прекрасном расположении духа и перечитываю записную книжку Бордена. Эти два последних факта не лишены связи.\n\n6 апреля 1904 года.\n\nЯ прочитал заметки Бордена в общей сложности три раза и подробно их комментировал и ссылался на них. Джулия собирается подготовить точную копию моего отредактированного и значительно расширенного текста.\n\nХотя ремиссия от моих недугов продолжается, и в течение последних нескольких дней я продолжал чувствовать себя лучше, я должен признать, что в целом мое здоровье ухудшается. Поэтому я признаюсь, что в эти последние месяцы моей жизни я намерен в последний раз отомстить моему врагу. Именно он вызвал это состояние, именно он должен заплатить. Приобретение его записной книжки дало мне выход. Я планирую организовать ее публикацию.\n\nПока я читал записную книжку Бордена, мне часто приходило в голову, что она заслуживает того, чтобы быть опубликованной в интересах его коллег-магов. В ней содержится много разумных замечаний об искусстве и технике магии.\n\nЯ считаю своим последним делом организовать публикацию от его имени, и когда я закончу свое аннотированное издание, я позабочусь об этом.\n\nЕсли он переживет меня, что вполне вероятно, он обнаружит, что моя месть тонка и многослойна.\n\nВо-первых, Борден будет потрясен, обнаружив, что то, что он считает своими величайшими профессиональными секретами, было опубликовано без его разрешения. Его унижение станет еще глубже, когда он поймет, что я виноват. Он будет сбит с толку, когда поймет, что каким-то образом я смог сделать это из-за могилы.\n\nКороче говоря, я улучшил его текст, сделав его менее неясным, расширив многие интересные общие темы, которые он просто упоминает, иллюстрируя свою захватывающую теорию согласия многочисленными примерами, описывая методы многих великих иллюзионистов. Я добавил подробные описания всех трюков, которые, как я знаю, он изобрел, а также тех других, которые, как я знаю, он способен выполнить, и в каждом случае, казалось, объяснял каждый из них, фактически не раскрывая главную тайну.\n\nПрежде всего, я усилил тайну, окружающую иллюзию, которую он называет Новым Перенесенным Человеком, но ничего не выдал. На то, что Бордены были однояйцевыми близнецами, даже не намекают. Тайна, которая завладела жизнью этих двух людей, остается тайной.\n\nПоэтому выживший Борден поймет, что последнее слово осталось за мной, что вражда окончена и что я одержал победу. Вторгаясь в его личную жизнь, я показал, что могу уважать ее. Из этого, я надеюсь, он поймет, что вражда, которую он питал между нами, была разрушительной, что, когда мы издевались друг над другом, мы растрачивали таланты в нас обоих. Мы должны были быть друзьями.\n\nЯ оставлю ему это, чтобы он мог размышлять об этом до конца своей жизни.\n\nИ есть еще одна месть-упущение: он никогда не раскроет секрет аппарата Теслы.\n\n18 мая 1904 года.\n\nЗавершив работу, мы отправили рукопись в издательство.\n\n2 июля 1904 года.\n\nЯ договорился об издательской сделке с господами Гудвином и Эндрюсоном из Олд-Бейли, Лондон.\n\nОни опубликуют книгу Бордена до конца этого года, тиражом в семьдесят пять экземпляров, по цене три гинеи каждая. Они обещают обильную иллюстрацию и интенсивную рекламу в личном письме своим постоянным клиентам.\n\n4 июля 1904 года.\n\nЗа последние четыре недели моя ремиссия закончилась, и прежняя болезнь вернулась в силу. Сначала появились язвы во рту и горле. Три недели назад я ослеп на один глаз, а через день или два-на другой. Всю последнюю неделю я не мог удержаться от твердой пищи, но Джулия три раза в день приносит мне мягкий бульон, и это поддерживает во мне жизнь. Мне так больно, что я не могу поднять голову с подушки. Врач звонит два раза в день, но говорит, что я слишком слаб, чтобы меня перевели в больницу. Мои симптомы настолько мучительны, что я не могу описать их подробно, но врач объясняет, что по какой-то причине весь естественный иммунитет моего организма к инфекции был поврежден.\n\n5 июля 1904 года.\n\nУ меня была неприятная ночь, и когда сегодня утром забрезжил рассвет, я поверил, что достиг своего последнего дня на этой земле. Однако сейчас приближается полночь, а я все еще жив.\n\nСегодня вечером у меня начался кашель, и доктор сразу же пришел ко мне. Он предложил купаться с прохладными полотенцами, и они помогли мне чувствовать себя более комфортно. Я не могу пошевелить ни одной частью своего тела.\n\n6 июля 1904 года.\n\nСегодня без четверти три утра моя жизнь была прервана внезапным сердечным приступом, последовавшим за приступом кашля и последующим внутренним кровотечением.\n\nМоя смерть была болезненной, грязной и глубоко огорчительной для Джулии и моих детей, а также для меня самого.\n\nСмерть уникально окружает мою жизнь!\n\nОднажды, в безобидном обмане, я притворился мертвым, чтобы Джулия могла жить без скандала как вдова. Каждое использование аппарата Теслы впоследствии приносило смерть моему опыту, несколько раз в неделю. Когда Руперта Энджера ложно похоронили, я был жив, чтобы засвидетельствовать это.\n\nЯ много раз обманывал смерть. Поэтому смерть приобрела для меня ощущение нереальности. Это стало обыденным событием, которое каким-то парадоксом, кажется, я всегда могу пережить.\n\nТеперь я вижу себя на смертном одре, умирающего от множественных раковых заболеваний, а потом, после этой ужасной и мучительной смерти, я здесь, чтобы сообщить об этом в своем дневнике. Среда, 6 июля 1904 года: день моей смерти.\n\nНи один человек не должен быть настолько несчастен, чтобы видеть то, что видел я.\n\nПозже\n\nЯ позаимствовал технику у Бордена, так что я-это я, как и я сам. Я, пишущий это, не то же самое, что Я, умерший. Мы стали двумя существами в ту ночь в Лоустофте, когда Борден вызвал неисправность аппарата Теслы. Мы разошлись в разные стороны. Мы снова были вместе с тех пор, как я вернулся в Колдлоу-хаус в конце марта, как раз когда началась моя временная ремиссия от рака.\n\nПока я был жив, я поддерживал иллюзию, что я один. Один из меня лежал, умирая, в то время как другой записывал мои последние опасения. Все записи в этом журнале с 26 марта написаны мной.\n\nКаждый из нас-престиж другого.\n\nМой покойный престиж лежит внизу в открытом гробу и через два дня будет помещен в фамильный склеп. Я, его живой престиж, продолжаю идти вперед.\n\nЯ-Достопочтенный Руперт Дэвид Энджер, 14-й граф Колдердейл, муж Джулии, отец Эдварда, Лидии и Флоренс, лорд Колдлоу-Хаус в графстве Дербишир, Англия.\n\nЗавтра я расскажу свою историю. События этого дня оставили меня, как и всех остальных в доме, слишком несчастным для чего-либо, кроме печали.\n\n7-й Мой 1904 год.\n\nОстаток моей жизни начинается с этого дня. Какие надежды может питать такой человек, как я! Вот моя история.\n\nГЛАВА ПЕРВАЯ.\n\nЯ появился на свет вечером 19 мая 1903 года в незанятой ложе театра \"Павильон\" в Лоустофте. Моя жизнь началась, когда я балансировал на деревянных перилах, с которых тут же упал навзничь. Я рухнул на пол ложи, разбросав стулья. Мгновение назад мне пришла в голову мысль: Борден каким-то образом нашел дорогу к ложе и ждет меня. Ясно, что нет! Пытаясь сориентироваться физически, я понял, что, хотя Борден каким-то образом повредил аппарат, транспортировка была завершена.\n\nЯркий свет хлынул в ложу, когда пятно повернулось на ней. Прошло не более двух - трех секунд. Я подумал: еще есть шанс спасти иллюзию! Я могу доползти до перил, сделать что-нибудь!\n\nЯ уже собирался взобраться на перила, когда, к своему изумлению, услышал на сцене голос, призывающий опустить занавес. Я двинулся вперед, не поднимая головы, и посмотрел вниз на сцену. Прежде чем занавес закрыл мне обзор, я на мгновение увидел себя, свой престиж, неподвижно стоящего на сцене.\n\nВ основание аппарата Теслы встроен отсек, в который автоматически падает престиж по мере трансформации. Мое старое тело, престиж, поэтому скрыто от зрителей, чтобы дать максимальное воздействие иллюзии.\n\nНа этот раз вмешательство Бордена, должно быть, помешало функционированию отсека, оставив \"престиж\" на виду!\n\nЯ быстро соображал. Адам Уилсон и Эстер находились за кулисами и разбирались с чрезвычайным происшествием там, за занавесом. Я был жив, силен и полностью владел своими чувствами.\n\nЯ поняла, что это моя обязанность-пробраться за кулисы и встретиться с Борденом раз и навсегда.\n\nЯ выбрался из ложи, поспешил по коридору, потом бегом поднялся по лестнице. Я прошел мимо одной из служанок. Я остановился перед ней и спросил: \"Вы не видели, чтобы кто-нибудь пытался покинуть театр?\"\n\nМой голос прозвучал как резкий шепот!\n\nЖенщина, уставившись прямо на меня, закричала от ужаса. Мгновение я стоял беспомощно, оглушенный ее ужасным воплем. Я понял, что зря теряю время, и положил руку ей на плечо, чтобы мягко оттолкнуть в сторону. Моя рука погрузилась в плоть ее руки!\n\nОна рухнула на ступеньки, дрожа и постанывая, когда я добрался до нижней ступеньки и нашел дверь за кулисы. Я распахнул ее и снова почувствовал, как мои руки вдавливаются в дерево. Мне нужно было найти Бордена, и у меня не было времени уделять ему много внимания.\n\nНе заметив меня, Адам Уилсон выбежал со своего места; я крикнул ему вслед, но он услышал меня не больше, чем увидел. Я на мгновение замолчала, пытаясь ясно представить, где находится Борден. Он каким-то образом прервал подачу электричества к аппарату, и это могло означать только то, что он получил доступ к мезонину подэтажа.\n\nЯ нашел лестницу, ведущую вниз, но, поднявшись на верхнюю ступеньку, услышал звук тяжелых шагов, приближающихся ко мне, и через мгновение появился сам Борден. Я замер. Когда он был не более чем в пяти футах от меня, он поднял голову, чтобы посмотреть, куда идет. Вместо этого он увидел меня! И снова я увидел выражение ужаса, исказившее черты лица служанки. Борден, защищаясь, вытянул перед собой руки. Почти сразу мы столкнулись.\n\nМы тяжело упали на каменный пол коридора. Он ненадолго оказался на мне, но я смогла выскользнуть. Я потянулся к нему.\n\n\"Держись от меня подальше\"! - крикнул он и, пригнувшись, спотыкаясь, пополз прочь.\n\nЯ подскочила к нему, схватила его за лодыжку, но он выскользнул из моих рук.\n\nЯ крикнул ему: \"Борден, мы должны прекратить эту опасную вражду!\", но мой голос снова прозвучал хрипло и неслышно, скорее дыхание, чем тон.\n\n- Я не это имела в виду! - воскликнул он.\n\nОн уже поднялся на ноги и отошел от меня, все еще глядя на меня с выражением ужаса. Я прекратил борьбу и позволил ему бежать.\n\nГЛАВА ВТОРАЯ.\n\nПосле той ночи я вернулся в Лондон, где прожил следующие десять месяцев, по собственному выбору и решению, в полумире.\n\nНесчастный случай в аппарате Теслы коренным образом повлиял на мое тело и душу, противопоставив их друг другу. Физически я превратился в призрак своего прежнего \"я\". Я жил, дышал, ел, пропускал телесные отходы, слышал и видел, чувствовал тепло и холод, но физически я был призраком. При ярком свете, если не смотреть на меня слишком пристально, я казался более или менее нормальным. Когда погода была пасмурной или я находился в искусственно освещенной комнате после наступления темноты, меня можно было видеть, но также и видеть насквозь. Мои очертания сохранились, и если люди достаточно пристально всматривались в меня, они могли разглядеть мое лицо, мою одежду и так далее, но для большинства людей я был отвратительным видением призрачного подземного мира. Служанка и Борден отреагировали так, словно увидели привидение, и действительно, так оно и было. Я быстро понял, что если позволю себе быть замеченным в таких обстоятельствах, то не только терроризирую большинство людей, с которыми сталкиваюсь, но и подвергаю себя некоторой опасности. Люди реагируют непредсказуемо, когда напуганы. Поэтому, как правило, я старался не попадаться на глаза, когда мог.\n\nНо в то же время мой ум внезапно почувствовал себя освобожденным от ограничений тела: я стал бдительным и быстро соображающим. Один из парадоксов, который это вызвало, состоял в том, что я обычно чувствовал себя сильным и способным, в то время как реальность заключалась в том, что я был неспособен выполнять большинство физических задач. Я должен был научиться держать такие предметы, как ручки и посуда, например, потому что небрежная хватка обычно заставляла их ускользать от меня.\n\nЯ оказался в неприятной ситуации, и большую часть времени моя новая ментальная энергия была направлена как чистая ненависть и страх на Бордена, который напал на меня. Он продолжал высасывать мою ментальную энергию, точно так же, как его действия высасывали мое физическое существо. Я стал невидимым для мира, почти мертвым.\n\nГЛАВА ТРЕТЬЯ.\n\nВскоре я обнаружил, что могу быть видимым или невидимым, когда захочу.\n\nЕсли бы я двигался после наступления сумерек и носил сценическую одежду, в которой был во время представления, я мог бы пойти почти куда угодно незамеченным. Если я хотел двигаться нормально, то я носил другую одежду и использовал масляную краску, чтобы придать моим чертам некоторую солидность, хотя это не было идеальной симуляцией. Деньги, еда, жилье не представляли для меня никаких проблем. Либо я брал то, что хотел, находясь в невидимом состоянии, либо платил за то, что мне было нужно. Такие опасения были тривиальны.\n\nНа самом деле я заботился о благополучии своего престижа.\n\nИз газетного сообщения я узнал, что Великий Дантон получил травмы во время выступления в Лоустофте, что он был вынужден отменить будущие ангажементы, но отдыхал дома и ожидал возвращения на сцену.\n\nЯ испытал облегчение, услышав это, но очень удивился! То, что я мельком увидел, когда опустился занавес, было, как я предполагал, моим собственным престижем, застывшим в полуживом, полуживом состоянии, которое я называл \"престижным\". Престиж - это исходное тело в транспорте, оставленное в аппарате Теслы, как бы мертвое. Сокрытие и избавление от этих престижных органов было единственной величайшей проблемой, которую мне пришлось решить, прежде чем я смог представить эту иллюзию публике.\n\nС этими новостями о плохом здоровье и отмененных встречах я понял, что в ту ночь произошло что-то другое. Транспортировка была только частичной, и я был печальным результатом. Большая часть меня осталась позади.\n\nИ я, и мой престиж были сильно подорваны вмешательством Бордена. У каждого из нас были свои проблемы. Я был в призрачном состоянии, мой престиж был в плохом состоянии. С момента несчастного случая он был обречен на смерть; между тем я был обречен на жизнь в тени, но мое здоровье оставалось нетронутым.\n\nВ июле, через два месяца после Лоустофта, мой авторитет, по-видимому, по собственной воле решил объявить о смерти Руперта Энджера. Это было именно то, что я сделал бы на его месте; в тот момент, когда я подумал об этом, я понял, что он-это я. Это был первый раз, когда мы пришли к одинаковому решению по отдельности, и мое первое предположение, что, хотя мы существовали отдельно, мы были эмоционально одним человеком.\n\nВскоре после этого мой престиж вернулся в Колдлоу-хаус, чтобы принять наследство; опять же, это то, что я сделал бы.\n\nЯ, однако, остался в Лондоне на некоторое время. У меня было жуткое дело, и я хотел провести его в тайне, не рискуя тем, что мое намерение будет связано с именем Колдердейлов.\n\nКороче говоря, я решил, что Борден, наконец, должен умереть. Я планировал убить его или, точнее, одного из них. Его тайная двойная жизнь превращала убийство в месть: он вмешивался в официальные записи, которые раскрывали существование близнецов, и прожил свою жизнь со скрытой половиной себя. Убийство одного из братьев положило бы конец его обману и было бы столь же удовлетворительным и эффективным, как и убийство их обоих. Я также рассудил, что в моем призрачном состоянии и с моей единственной известной личностью, публично похороненной и оплакиваемой, меня, Руперта Энджера, никогда не поймают и даже не заподозрят в преступлении.\n\nВ Лондоне я приступил к осуществлению своих планов. Я мог использовать свою виртуальную невидимость, чтобы следить за Борденом, когда он занимался своей жизнью и делами. Я видел его в доме его семьи, я видел, как он готовил и репетировал свое сценическое шоу в своей мастерской, я стоял невидимый за кулисами театра, когда он исполнял свои иллюзии, Я выследил его в тайном месте, которое он делил в северном Лондоне с Оливией Свенсон... а однажды я даже мельком увидел Бордена с его братом-близнецом, коротко встретившихся на темной улице, торопливо обменявшихся информацией, какое-то отчаянное дело, которое нужно было закончить немедленно и лично.\n\nУвидев его с Оливией, я решил, что он должен умереть. Достаточно чувств осталось от этого старого предательства, чтобы добавить боль к возмущению.\n\nОдна только мысль об убийстве доставляла мне такое удовлетворение и возбуждение, что моя личность менялась. Я, который был по ту сторону смерти, жил, чтобы убивать.\n\nКак только я принял решение, совершение преступления не могло ждать. Я видел в смерти одного из близнецов Борденов ключ к моей собственной свободе.\n\nНо у меня не было опыта насилия, и прежде чем я мог что-то сделать, я должен был решить, как лучше всего это сделать. Я решил, что придется ударить его ножом. Экспериментальным путем я обнаружил, что если держать нож с длинным лезвием в обеих руках, крепко, но не сильно, то он может скользить с достаточной силой, чтобы проникнуть в плоть.\n\nГЛАВА ЧЕТВЕРТАЯ.\n\nЧерез два дня после того, как я закончил свои приготовления, я последовал за Борденом в театр Королевы в Байхэме, где он был первым номером эстрадного билла, работавшего всю неделю. В тот день, кроме вечернего, был еще и дневной спектакль. Я знал, что у Бордена была привычка в перерывах между выступлениями удаляться в свою гримерку, чтобы вздремнуть на диване.\n\nЯ наблюдал за его выступлением из-за темных кулис, а потом последовал за ним в гримерную. Когда он вошел и закрыл за собой дверь, я пошел туда, где спрятал свое орудие убийства, и осторожно вернулся в коридор перед комнатой Бордена.\n\nНа мне был сценический костюм из Лоустофта, моя обычная одежда, когда я хотел двигаться незаметно, но нож был обычным. Если бы меня кто-нибудь увидел, это выглядело бы так, будто нож плавает в воздухе без опоры; я не мог рисковать, чтобы на меня обратили внимание.\n\nЕще раз убедившись, что никто не приближается, я подошел к двери и прислонился к ней, мягко, но твердо прижавшись лицом к дереву. Через несколько секунд передняя часть моей головы прошла, и я смог заглянуть в комнату. Борден лежал на кушетке, закрыв глаза и сложив руки на груди.\n\nЯ убрал лицо.\n\nСжимая нож, я открыл дверь и вошел внутрь. Борден пошевелился и посмотрел на меня.\n\n\"Кто это\"? - спросил Борден, прищурившись.\n\nЯ сделал два шага по узкому полу, потом вскочил на диван и заполз на него. Я присел на корточки у него на животе и поднял нож обеими руками.\n\nБорден увидел нож и сосредоточился на мне. В тусклом свете я был едва виден. Должно быть, я представлял собой дикое и ужасное зрелище; я не брился и не стригся уже больше двух месяцев, и лицо у меня было худое. Я сидел у него на животе. Я держал нож, готовясь к смертельному удару.\n\n\"Кто ты\"? Борден ахнул. Он схватил меня за призрачные запястья, пытаясь удержать, но освободиться от него было просто. - Кто...?\n\n- Приготовься умереть, Борден! - крикнул я, зная, что он услышит только хриплый и ужасающий шепот, на который я был способен.\n\n-Энджер? Пожалуйста! Я понятия не имел, что делаю! Я не хотел ничего плохого\"!\n\n- Это сделал ты? Или это был другой\"?\n\n- Что вы имеете в виду?\n\n- Это был ты или твой брат-близнец?\n\n\"У меня нет брата\"!\n\n- Ты сейчас умрешь! Признай правду\"!\n\n\"Я один\"!\n\n\"Слишком поздно\"! - крикнул я и намеренно вложил руки в рукоятку, которая, как я знал, даст мне самую сильную хватку на ноже. Я бы потерял хватку, если бы ударил слишком яростно, поэтому я опустил лезвие в место над его сердцем и начал постоянное давление, которое, как я знал, приведет лезвие к цели. Я почувствовала, как ткань его рубашки разорвалась, и острие ножа вонзилось в его плоть.\n\nПотом я увидел выражение лица Бордена. Он был полон страха. Его руки были где-то над моей головой, пытаясь схватить меня. Его челюсть отвисла, а язык высунулся вперед. Его грудь сотрясалась от неистового дыхания.\n\nНи слова не слетело с его губ, но он пытался заговорить. Я услышал шипение человека, тонущего в собственном ужасе.\n\nЯ понял, что он уже не был сильным человеком. Его волосы начали седеть. Кожа вокруг глаз сморщилась от усталости. Его шея была покрыта морщинами. Он лежал подо мной, борясь за свою жизнь с бестелесным демоном, который присел на корточки на его теле с ножом, готовым убить его.\n\nЭта мысль вызвала у меня отвращение. Я не мог так убивать. Весь страх, гнев и напряжение покинули меня. Я отбросил нож в сторону и откатился. Я попятилась от него.\n\nОн остался лежать на кушетке, содрогаясь от ужаса и облегчения. Я стоял, подавленный тем эффектом, который произвел на этого человека.\n\nНаконец, он стабилизировался.\n\n\"Кто ты\"? - сказал он, и его испуганный голос был неровным, срываясь на фальцет на последнем слове.\n\n-Я Руперт Энджер,- хрипло ответил я.\n\n- Но ты же мертв!\n\n\"Да\".\n\n- Тогда как...?\n\n- Нам не следовало начинать все это, Борден. Но убить тебя-это не способ покончить с этим\".\n\nЯ был унижен ужасом того, что пытался сделать. Как я мог вообразить, что могу убить человека? Я скорбно отвернулся от Бордена и с силой навалился на деревянную дверь.\n\nГЛАВА ПЯТАЯ.\n\nПокушение на жизнь Бордена повергло меня в отчаяние и отвращение к самому себе. Я знал, что предал себя, предал свой престиж (который не знал ни о каких моих действиях), предал Джулию, моих детей, имя моего отца, всех друзей, которых я знал. Если мне когда-нибудь и требовалось доказательство того, что моя вражда с Борденом была ужасной ошибкой, то теперь оно у меня было.\n\nВ состоянии апатии я вернулся в комнату, которую снял, думая, что больше ничего не могу сделать со своей жизнью. Мне больше не для чего было жить.\n\nГЛАВА ШЕСТАЯ.\n\nЯ планировал зачахнуть и умереть, но есть дух жизни, даже в таком человеке, как я, который стоит на пути таких решений. Я думал, что если не буду есть и пить, то смерть просто последует за мной, но я обнаружил, что не в состоянии противостоять жажде и голоду.\n\nБольшую часть зимы я провел в жалком состоянии, потерпев неудачу даже в саморазрушении.\n\nИменно тогда, когда я подумал о жизни моего другого \"я\", о престиже, оставшемся после Лоустофта, я почувствовал острое сосредоточение. Я сразу понял, что он в беде. И снова, когда я думал конкретно о его здоровье, я сразу понял, что понял, что происходит. Он был болен, даже умирал. Я должна быть с ним, помогать ему всем, чем смогу.\n\nК этому времени я и сам не был большой фигурой физической силы. Моя плохая диета и недостаток физических упражнений превратили меня в настоящий скелет.\n\nПоэтому я решил улучшить свою внешность. Я начал принимать пищу и питье в разумных количествах, подстриг свои длинные волосы и украл новый комплект одежды. После Лоустофта мне потребовалось бы несколько недель ухода, чтобы привести себя в прежний вид, но я почти сразу почувствовал себя лучше, и настроение у меня поднялось.\n\nВ последнюю неделю марта я купил билет на ночной поезд до Шеффилда.\n\nГЛАВА СЕДЬМАЯ.\n\nЯ знал, что мое внезапное появление не удивит ту часть меня, которую я называл своим престижем.\n\nПодойдя к дому, я постучал в дверь. Я мог бы войти сам, но понятия не имел, что там искать. Я почувствовал, что лучше всего сделать шаг за шагом мое неожиданное возвращение.\n\nХаттон открыл дверь. Я снял шляпу и стал прямо перед ним. Он молча смотрел на нее, и лицо его оставалось бесстрастным. Я знал его достаточно хорошо, чтобы понять, что его молчание выдавало его тревогу.\n\nКогда я дал ему время понять, кем я могу быть, я сказал: \"Хаттон, я рад видеть тебя снова\".\n\nОн открыл рот, чтобы что-то сказать, но не смог.\n\n- Вы должны знать, что произошло в Лоустофте, Хаттон, - сказал я. \"Я-несчастное следствие этого\".\n\n-Да, сэр, - сказал он наконец.\n\n- Можно мне войти?\n\n- Мне сказать леди Колдердейл, что вы здесь, сэр?\n\n- Я хотел бы поговорить с вами спокойно, прежде чем увижу ее, Хаттон. Я знаю, что мое прибытие сюда, вероятно, вызовет тревогу\".\n\nОн отвел меня в свою гостиную рядом с кухней и угостил чаем. Я потягивала его, стоя перед ним, не зная, как объяснить. Хаттон, человек, которым я всегда восхищался за его присутствие духа, вскоре взял ситуацию под контроль.\n\n-Думаю, будет лучше, сэр, - сказал он, - если вы подождете здесь, пока я доложу о вашем прибытии ее светлости. Тогда она, я думаю, придет к вам. Вам лучше решить, как действовать вместе\".\n\n-Хаттон, скажи мне. Как там мой ... Я имею в виду, как здоровье...?\n\n- Его светлость серьезно болен, сэр. Однако прогноз отличный, и на этой неделе он вернулся из больницы. Он выздоравливает в садовой комнате, куда мы перенесли его кровать. Полагаю, ее светлость сейчас с ним.\n\n-Это невозможная ситуация, Хаттон,- сказал я.\n\n- Так и есть, сэр.\n\n- В особенности для тебя, я имею в виду.\n\n-И для меня, и для вас, и для всех, сэр. Я понимаю, что произошло в том театре в Лоустофте. Его светлость, то есть вы, сэр, посвятили меня в свои тайны. Вы, без сомнения, помните, что я много занимался утилизацией материалов \"престижа\". Конечно, в этом доме нет никаких секретов, милорд, как вы и приказывали.\n\n- Адам Уилсон здесь?\n\n\"Да, это он\".\n\n- Я рад это знать.\n\nЧерез несколько минут Хаттон ушел и через пять минут вернулся с Джулией. Она выглядела усталой. Она подошла прямо ко мне, и мы довольно тепло обнялись, но оба так нервничали. Я чувствовал, как она напряглась, когда мы обнялись.\n\nХаттон извинился и ушел, когда мы остались одни.\n\nЯ объяснил Джулии пределы моего телесного существования; как я исчезну из поля зрения без яркого света, как я могу проскользнуть сквозь твердые предметы.\n\nЗатем она рассказала мне о раковых опухолях, от которых страдал я, мой престиж, и о том, как каким-то чудом они, казалось, отступили сами по себе, позволив мне, ему, вернуться домой.\n\n\"Полностью ли он выздоровеет\"? - с тревогой спросил я.\n\n- Хирург сказал, что выздоровление иногда происходит спонтанно, но в большинстве случаев ремиссия наступает лишь на короткое время. Он верит в это дело, ты, он ... - Она, казалось, готова была заплакать, поэтому я взял ее за руку. Она взяла себя в руки и печально произнесла: - Он считает, что это лишь временное состояние. Рак широко распространен\".\n\nЗатем она рассказала мне о том, что меня больше всего удивило: что Борден, или, точнее, один из близнецов Борденов, умер и что его записная книжка попала в мое, наше, владение.\n\nЯ был поражен, чтобы услышать подобные вещи. Например, я узнал, что Борден умер всего через три дня после моего неудачного покушения на его жизнь; эти два события казались мне неотвратимо связанными. Джулия сказала, что у него случился сердечный приступ; я подумала, что это могло быть вызвано страхом, который я в нем подняла. Я вспомнил его ужасные крики боли, его затрудненное дыхание и общий вид усталости и плохого самочувствия. Я знал, что сердечные приступы могут быть вызваны стрессом, но до этого момента предполагал, что после моего ухода Борден придет в себя и в конце концов придет в норму.\n\nЯ рассказал свою историю Джулии, но она, похоже, считала, что эти два события никак не связаны.\n\nЕще больший интерес вызвала новость о блокноте Бордена. Я спросил ее, есть ли у меня, моего престижа, какие-либо планы относительно того, что с этим делать, но она сказала, что болезнь все прервала. Она упомянула, что отчасти разделяет мои угрызения совести по отношению к Бордену и что мой престиж во многом совпадает с ее мнением.\n\nЯ спросил: \"Где он? Мы должны быть вместе\".\n\n-Он скоро проснется,- ответила Джулия.\n\nГЛАВА ВОСЬМАЯ.\n\nМое воссоединение с самим собой, должно быть, одно из самых необычных в истории! Мы с ним прекрасно дополняли друг друга. Все, чего мне не хватало, было в нем; все, что у меня было, он потерял. Конечно, мы были похожи, ближе друг к другу, чем однояйцевые близнецы.\n\nКогда один из нас говорил, другой мог легко закончить предложение. Мы двигались одинаково, имели одинаковые жесты и манеры, приходили к одной и той же мысли в один и тот же момент. Я знала о нем все, и он знал то же самое обо мне. Все, чего нам не хватало между собой, - это наших отдельных переживаний за последние несколько месяцев, но как только мы описали их друг другу, даже эта разница исчезла.\n\nКак только мы были вместе, не было ничего, что заставило бы нас снова расстаться. Я попросил Хаттона постелить вторую кровать в садовой комнате, чтобы обе мои половинки могли все время быть вместе.\n\nНичто из этого не могло быть скрыто от остальных домочадцев, и вскоре я воссоединилась со своими детьми, с Адамом и Гертрудой Уилсон, а также с миссис Хаттон, экономкой. Все восклицали о сверхъестественном двойном эффекте, который мы создали. Страшно подумать, какое влияние это откровение их отца окажет на моих детей в будущем, но обе части меня, и Джулия, согласились, что правда лучше, чем очередная ложь.\n\nВскоре леденящий душу факт рака заставил нас осознать, что если что-то еще нужно сделать, то сейчас самое время.\n\nГЛАВА ДЕВЯТАЯ.\n\nС начала апреля до середины мая мы вместе работали над редакцией блокнота Бордена, готовя его к изданию. Мой брат-близнец (ибо так стало удобно думать о моем престиже) вскоре снова заболел, и хотя он проделал большую часть первоначальной работы над книгой, именно я завершил ее и договорился с издателем.\n\nИ я, используя его личность, вела дневник для него до самой его смерти. Итак, вчера наша двойная жизнь подошла к концу, а вместе с ней и моя собственная короткая жизненная история. Теперь есть только я, и я снова живу после смерти.\n\n8 июля 1904 года.\n\nСегодня утром мы с Уилсоном спустились в подвал, где осмотрели аппарат Теслы. Он был в полном рабочем состоянии.\n\nУилсон спросил, не разобрать ли нам устройство.\n\nЯ немного подумал, потом сказал: \"Давай оставим это до похорон\".\n\nЦеремония назначена на завтра в полдень.\n\nПосле того как Уилсон ушел, а я запер входную дверь в подвал, я включил устройство и использовал его для передачи новых золотых монет. Я думал о будущем, о моем сыне, 15-м графе, о моей жене, вдове.\n\nЯ не считал богатства, которые мы создали с помощью этого устройства, но мой престиж показал мне хранилище, которое он сделал, хранящееся в закрытом и запертом отсеке в самой темной нише подвала. Я снял то, что, по моим подсчетам, стоило две тысячи фунтов, чтобы удовлетворить насущные потребности Джулии, затем добавил несколько новых монет к тому, что осталось.\n\nОднако я позабочусь о том, чтобы устройство Теслы осталось нетронутым. Инструкции Аллеи останутся при нем. Когда-нибудь Эдвард найдет этот дневник и поймет, для чего лучше всего использовать аппарат.\n\nПозже.\n\nДо похорон осталось всего несколько часов, и я не могу тратить слишком много времени на эти страницы. Поэтому позвольте мне отметить следующее.\n\nСейчас восемь часов вечера, и я нахожусь в садовой комнате, которую делил со своим престижем до его смерти. Несколько минут назад я тихонько прогуливалась по территории дома, вдыхая летние ароматы, прислушиваясь к тихим звукам этой вересковой пустоши, которую так любила в детстве.\n\nЭто прекрасный теплый вечер, в который можно планировать конец, самый конец.\n\nЖизнь стала не стоящей того, чтобы жить. Все, что я люблю, запрещено мне тем состоянием, в котором я нахожусь. Моя семья принимает меня. Они знают, кто я и что я такое, и что мои обстоятельства не созданы мной самим. Но даже если так, человек, которого они любили, мертв, и я не могу заменить его. Для них будет лучше, если я уйду, чтобы они, наконец, могли начать полностью и свободно горевать о человеке, который умер. В выражении горя заключается выздоровление от самого горя.\n\nУ меня тоже нет никакого законного существования: Руперт Энджер, волшебник, мертв и похоронен, 14-й граф Колдердейл будет похоронен завтра.\n\nМое единственное ожидание жизни - как призрак самого себя.\n\nТак что теперь все должно кончиться, и я умру.\n\nНо проклятие жизни тоже цепляется за меня! Я уже обнаружил, как яростно горит во мне дух жизни, и что не только убийство этически выше меня, но и самоубийство для меня невозможно. Я могу заставить себя умереть, только убедив себя, что есть также надежда, что я не добьюсь успеха.\n\nКак только я закончу эти записи, я спрячу этот дневник и более ранние тома его где-нибудь среди престижных книг, которые лежат в сейфе. Затем я открою отсек в подвале, оставив золото моему сыну или его сыну, чтобы они в конце концов нашли его. Этот дневник не должен быть обнаружен, пока золото еще не израсходовано, потому что я признался в подделке.\n\nКогда все это будет сделано, я снова зарядлю устройство Теслы и использую его в последний раз.\n\nЯ провел последний час, измеряя и проверяя координаты, готовясь, репетируя, как будто тысячи зрителей будут смотреть. Но этот магический акт должен произойти, пока я один, потому что я спроецирую себя в мертвое тело моего престижа, и там придет мой конец!\n\nЯ прибуду туда; в этом нет никакого сомнения, потому что аппарат Теслы никогда еще не колебался в своей точности. Но каков будет результат этого болезненного союза?\n\nЕсли это провал, я материализуюсь в бедном, пораженном раком теле моего престижа, мертвый в течение двух дней. Я тоже мгновенно умру и ничего об этом не узнаю. Завтра, когда они положат тело на покой, они положат меня вместе с ним.\n\nНо я верю, что есть шанс на другой исход, который признает мое отчаянное желание жить. Эта материализация может и не убить меня!\n\nЯ уверен, почти уверен, что мое появление в теле моего престижа вернет ему жизнь. Это будет воссоединение, окончательное соединение. У меня есть дух, которого у него никогда не было. Я оживлю его тело своим духом. У меня есть воля к жизни, которая была отнята у него; я верну ее ему. У меня есть жизненная искра, которой сейчас не хватает ему. Я исцелю его тело своей чистотой здоровья, снова прокачаю кровь по его артериям и венам.\n\nРазве это безумие - думать, что такое возможно?\n\nЯ достаточно безумен, пока еще строю планы, чтобы верить, что есть надежда. Эта надежда позволяет мне продвигаться вперед.\n\nБезумное ожившее тело моего престижа поднимется из открытого гроба и быстро уйдет из этого дома. Все, что стало для меня запретным, останется позади. Я любил эту жизнь и любил других, пока был в ней, но поскольку моя единственная оставшаяся надежда на жизнь-это поступок, который каждый здравомыслящий человек счел бы позорным, я должен стать изгоем, оставить позади всех тех, кого я любил, выйти в мир, сделать то, что я могу, из того, что я нахожу.\n\nТеперь я это сделаю!\n\nЯ пойду один до конца.\n\nЧАСТЬ ПЯТАЯ.\n\nПРЕСТИГИ.\n\nГЛАВА ПЕРВАЯ.\n\nГолос брата беспрерывно говорил мне: \"лам, не уходи, останься со мной, приди\".\n\nМне пришлось встать с постели. Я быстро оделся, схватил свои вещи и спустился вниз. Я взглянул на часы. Это было после двух часов ночи.\n\nМой брат сказал: \"Ну, хорошо.\n\nКейт все еще была в столовой, сидя в кресле у камина. Она слушала портативное радио. Она, казалось, не удивилась, увидев меня.\n\n-Мне было холодно, - сказал я. - Я не могла заснуть. В любом случае, я должен пойти и найти его\".\n\n\"Там гораздо холоднее\". - Она указала на темноту за окнами. \"Тебе все это понадобится\".\n\nНа стул напротив нее она положила несколько предметов теплой одежды, включая шерстяной свитер, толстое пальто, шарф, перчатки, пару резиновых сапог. И два больших факела.\n\nМой брат снова заговорил. Я не мог его игнорировать.\n\nЯ сказал Кейт: \"Ты знала, что я это сделаю\".\n\n- Да. Я тут подумал\".\n\n- Ты знаешь, что со мной происходит?\n\n- Думаю, что да. Тебе придется пойти и найти его\".\n\n- Ты пойдешь со мной?\n\n- Она покачала головой. \"Ни за что на свете\".\n\n- Так ты знаешь, где он?\n\n- Я думаю, что знаю это всю свою жизнь, но мне всегда было легче выбросить это из головы. Самое трудное во встрече с тобой-осознать, что то, что травмировало меня в детстве, все еще там, внизу\".\n\nСнег прекратился, но ветер был ледяной. В центре сада снег был достаточно мелким, чтобы я мог пройти.\n\nКейт включила сигнализацию, которая залила помещение ярким светом. Это помогло мне увидеть свой путь.\n\nБрат сказал: Мне холодно, я жду.\n\nЯ продолжал идти. Я увидела кирпичную арку, где, по словам Кейт, она должна была находиться. У его основания громоздился снег.\n\nДверь была не заперта и легко поддалась, когда я потянул за ручку. Дверь открылась наружу, в сугроб, и как только я крепко ухватился за нее, то смог отодвинуть снег достаточно далеко, чтобы протиснуться внутрь.\n\nЯ заглянул внутрь, позволяя лучу большего из двух факелов играть передо мной. Смотреть было особенно не на что: наклонная скалистая крыша, несколько ступенек и внизу вторая дверь.\n\nСлово \" Да \" сформировалось у меня в голове.\n\nВторая дверь не имела замка и плавно открылась от моего прикосновения. Лучи моих факелов вращались вокруг; один в моей руке обыскивал все вокруг, другой, зажатый под мышкой, следил за направлением моего взгляда.\n\nЗатем моя нога наткнулась на что-то твердое, торчащее из пола, и я споткнулся. Факел под моей рукой сломался, когда я ударился о каменную стену. Присев на корточки и опершись на колено, я использовал один факел, чтобы осмотреть другой.\n\n- Там свет, - сказал брат.\n\nЯ замахнулся еще раз, одиночный луч фонарика, и на высоте плеча, я заметил, что обыкновенный выключатель. Я включил его. Сначала ничего не происходило.\n\nЗатем дальше, в пещере, глубоко внутри холма, я услышал звук двигателя. Когда генератор набрал скорость, по всей длине пещеры зажегся свет. Это были всего лишь маломощные лампочки, прикрепленные к каменному потолку, но теперь света было достаточно, чтобы видеть без фонарика.\n\nПещера представляла собой естественную трещину в скале с дополнительным туннелем. Воздух был удивительно сладким и заметно теплее, чем снаружи.\n\nЯ прошел несколько шагов по пещере, балансируя руками на скалистых стенах с обеих сторон. Пройдя около пятидесяти ярдов, пол круто обрывался и поворачивал направо, а слева от главного туннеля я заметил большую полость, которая, судя по округлости входа, была выдолблена искусственно. Отверстие не было освещено электричеством, поэтому я посветил внутрь оставшимся факелом.\n\nЯ сразу хотела, у меня не было. Он был полон древних гробов. Большинство из них были сложены горизонтально, хотя около дюжины стояли, прислонившись к стенам. Они были всех размеров. Все гробы находились в разной степени разложения. У основания большинства куч лежали груды коричневых обломков, по-видимому, костей.\n\nЯ быстро отступил в главный туннель и взглянул на дверь, через которую вошел. Там был небольшой изгиб, и теперь мой выход был невидим для меня. Где-то в глубине пещеры продолжал работать генератор.\n\nЯ весь дрожал. Но я не мог вернуться. Мой брат был здесь.\n\nРешив быстро решить эту проблему, я пошел по тропинке вниз и направо. За ним последовал еще один лестничный пролет.\n\nОпираясь рукой о стену, я спустился по ним. Туннель сразу же открылся в более широкую пещеру.\n\nТам было полно современных металлических стеллажей, выкрашенных в коричневый цвет и скрепленных хромированными болтами. На каждой полке было по три широких полки, одна на другой. Узкий проход шел рядом с каждой стойкой, а центральный проход тянулся по всей длине зала. Над каждым проходом между полками стояла лампа, освещая то, что на них лежало.\n\nГЛАВА ВТОРАЯ.\n\nНа каждой полке стеллажей лежали обнаженные человеческие тела. Каждый из них был мужчиной и полностью одет. Все они были одеты в вечерние платья: облегающий пиджак с фалдами, белая рубашка с черным галстуком-бабочкой, жилет, узкие брюки, белые носки и кожаные туфли. На руках были белые хлопчатобумажные перчатки.\n\nКаждое тело было идентично всем остальным. У мужчины было бледное лицо, орлиный нос и тонкие усики. Губы его были бледны. У него был узкий лоб и редеющие волосы, зачесанные назад. Некоторые лица смотрели на стеллаж над ними или на скалистый потолок. У других были повернуты шеи, так что они смотрели то в одну, то в другую сторону.\n\nУ всех трупов были открыты глаза.\n\nБольшинство из них улыбались, показывая зубы.\n\nВсе трупы лежали в разных позах. Одни были прямыми, другие скрюченными или согнутыми. Каждый труп стоял одной ногой в воздухе.\n\nРуки тоже находились в разных положениях. Одни были подняты над головой, другие вытянуты вперед, как у лунатика, третьи лежали прямо рядом с телом.\n\nНи на одном из трупов не было никаких признаков разложения. Как будто каждый из них был заморожен в жизни.\n\nНа них не было ни пыли, ни запаха.\n\nК переднему краю каждой полки была прикреплена белая карточка. Она была написана от руки и помещена в пластиковый держатель, прикрепленный к нижней стороне полки. Первый, на кого я посмотрел, сказал следующее::\n\nТеатр Доминион, Киддерминстер 14/4/01\n\n3.15 вечера (М)\n\n2359/23\n\n25г.\n\nНа полке над ним лежала почти идентичная карточка:\n\nТеатр Доминион, Киддерминстер\n\n14/4/01\n\n8.30 вечера (E)\n\n2360/23\n\n25г.\n\nНад этим был помечен третий труп:\n\nТеатр Доминион, Киддерминстер 15/4/01\n\n3.15 вечера (М)\n\n2361/23\n\n25г.\n\nНа следующей полке лежали еще три трупа, все помеченные и датированные одинаково. Они были разложены по датам. Менялись театры и даты. Их было много.\n\nЯ двинулся дальше, протискиваясь по узкому центральному проходу в дальний конец пещеры. Здесь, на верхней полке последнего стеллажа, я наткнулся на тело маленького мальчика.\n\nОн умер, борясь. Голова его была запрокинута назад и повернута вправо. Рот его был открыт, уголки губ опущены. Его глаза были широко открыты и смотрели вверх. Его волосы развевались. Все его конечности были напряжены, как будто он боролся за свободу. Он был одет в темно-красную толстовку, маленькие синие джинсы и синие парусиновые туфли.\n\nНа его этикетке тоже было написано от руки::\n\nКолдлоу Хаус\n\n17/12/70\n\n7.45 вечера\n\n0000/23\n\n0г.\n\nСверху было написано имя мальчика: Николас Джулиус Борден.\n\nЯ взял этикетку и положил ее в карман, затем потянулся вперед и притянул его к себе. Я держала его на руках. В тот момент, когда я прикоснулся к нему, постоянное фоновое присутствие моего брата исчезло и умерло.\n\nЯ впервые почувствовал его отсутствие.\n\nГлядя на него в своих руках, я попыталась придать ему более удобное положение для переноски. Его конечности, шея и туловище были жесткими и гибкими, словно сделанными из прочной резины. Я мог бы изменить их положение, но в тот момент, когда я отпустил их, они вернулись в ту форму, в которой я нашел его.\n\nКогда я попытался пригладить его волосы, они тоже вернулись в прежнее положение.\n\nЯ крепко прижала его к себе. Ему не было ни холодно, ни тепло. Одна из его вытянутых рук, стиснутых в страхе, касалась моей щеки. Облегчение от того, что она наконец нашла его, переполнило все - все, кроме страха перед этим местом. Мне хотелось развернуться, чтобы направиться обратно к выходу, но для этого нужно было выйти из коридора. Я держал свою прошлую жизнь в своих руках, но я больше не знал, что может стоять позади меня.\n\nНо что-то было.\n\nГЛАВА ТРЕТЬЯ.\n\nЯ пошел назад, не оглядываясь. Я добрался до главного прохода и медленно обернулся.\n\nЯ увидел, что в этом конце коридора была еще одна комната, всего в пяти или шести футах от того места, где я стоял. Именно отсюда доносился звук двигателя генератора. Я направился к нему. Вход в пещеру был наклонным и низким.\n\nЗвук генератора стал громче, и я почувствовал запах бензиновых паров, исходящих от него. В комнате, за входом, горело еще несколько огней. Я не могла пройти через щель, не положив тело Ники, поэтому наклонилась, чтобы посмотреть, что может быть внутри.\n\nЯ ничего не видел. Внутри ничего не двигалось.\n\nЯ сделал шаг назад, потом еще один, как можно тише.\n\nКто-то стоял в этой комнате, молча, неподвижно, прямо за пределами моего поля зрения, ожидая, когда я войду или отступлю.\n\nЯ продолжала шагать назад по темному узкому проходу между стеллажами, стараясь не задеть голову или ноги Ники о тела на полках. Ужас высасывал силы из моего тела.\n\nРаздался мужской голос из комнаты, эхом разнесшийся по залу: - Вы Борден, не так ли?\n\nЯ ничего не ответил, парализованный страхом.\n\n- Я так и думал, что в конце концов ты придешь за ним. Голос был тонким, усталым, не более чем шепот, но пещера отдавала эхом. - Он-это ты, Борден, а все они-это я. Ты собираешься уехать с ним? Или ты собираешься остаться?\n\nЯ увидел призрачную тень, движущуюся за входом, а затем, к моему ужасу, звук генератора быстро затих.\n\nЯ был в непроглядной тьме. Фонарик лежал у меня в кармане. Я переместил вес маленького мальчика и ухитрился ухватиться за факел.\n\nДрожащей рукой я включил его. Я попыталась крепко ухватиться за факел и удержать тело Ники в своих объятиях. Я обернулся.\n\nТени поднятых ног кружились вокруг меня на стенах пещеры.\n\nЯ протолкался по остальному проходу между стеллажами. Мои плечи и руки столкнулись с полками и сорвали несколько пластиковых этикеток.\n\nЯ не осмеливался оглянуться. Этот человек шел следом! У меня не было сил, я знал, что могу упасть в любой момент.\n\nТеперь дорога шла в гору, и Ники с каждым шагом становился все тяжелее. Я повернул ногу, ударился о стену туннеля, пришел в себя и пошел дальше. Меня гнал страх.\n\nНаконец передо мной появилась внутренняя дверь. Едва задержавшись, я распахнул ее ногой в сапоге и протиснулся внутрь.\n\nЗа моей спиной послышались шаги, размеренно шагающие следом.\n\nЯ взбежал по лестнице на поверхность, но налетевший снег засыпал верхние четыре или пять ступенек. Я поскользнулась, упала вперед, и маленький мальчик выкатился из моих рук! Я прыгнул вперед и толкнул дверь всем своим весом.\n\nЯ увидел: заснеженная земля, черный силуэт дома, два освещенных окна, открытый дверной проем со светом за ним, снег, падающий с неба!\n\nМой брат кричал в моем сознании!\n\nЯ обернулся, увидел его распростертым на ступеньках и поднял. Спотыкаясь, я вышел на снег.\n\nЯ брел, шатаясь, по толстому снегу, целясь в дверной проем, постоянно поворачивая голову, чтобы оглянуться через плечо на черный прямоугольник открытого склепа, боясь увидеть появление того, что преследовало меня.\n\nВ дверях появилась Кейт, одетая в пальто.\n\nЯ попытался крикнуть ей предостережение, но у меня не хватило дыхания. Я продолжала идти, шатаясь по снегу, держа перед собой тело Ники. Наконец я добрался до двора перед дверью, поскользнулся на заснеженном бетоне и протиснулся мимо Кейт в ярко освещенный коридор.\n\nОна молча смотрела на тело маленького мальчика у меня на руках.\n\n\"Следи за хранилищем\"! Я сказал. Это была единственная фраза, которую я смогла произнести. \"Смотри\"!\n\nТам, по ту сторону снега, ничего не двигалось. Я сделала шаг назад и опустила тело Ники на пол.\n\nЯ пошарил в кармане и нашел этикетку, которая была на вешалке Ники. Я отдал его Кейт. Я все еще боролся за дыхание, и мне казалось, что я никогда больше не смогу дышать нормально.\n\n- Вы только посмотрите - ахнул я. Рукопись! Это одно и то же\"?\n\nОна взяла его у меня, поднесла к свету и внимательно посмотрела. Потом она посмотрела прямо на меня. Ее глаза расширились от страха.\n\n- Так оно и есть, не так ли? - крикнул я.\n\nОна положила руки на верхнюю часть моей руки, и держала себя в отношении меня. Я чувствовал, как она дрожит.\n\nНезваный гость погас.\n\n\"Включите его снова\"! - крикнул я.\n\nКейт нашла выключатель. Потом она снова взяла меня за руку.\n\nСнег кружился в ярком свете. Сквозь нее смутно виднелся вход в хранилище. Мы оба увидели тонкую фигуру человека, выходящего из двери хранилища. Он был одет в темную одежду. Длинные черные волосы выбивались из-под капюшона куртки. Он поднял руку, чтобы защитить глаза от яркого света. Он не выказывал ни любопытства, ни страха перед нами, хотя, должно быть, знал, что мы наблюдаем за ним. Не глядя на нас, он ступил на ровную землю, сгорбив плечи в метели, затем двинулся вправо, между деревьями, вниз по склону и скрылся из виду.",

        "en": "Chapter one. Information Flow is Your Lifeblood.\n\nInformation work is thinking work. When thinking and working together are significantly assisted by computer technology, you have a digital nervous system. It consists of the advanced digital processes that knowledge workers use to make better decisions - to think, act, react, and adapt. Michael Dertouzos of MIT writes that the future \"Information Marketplace\" will require a large amount of special software and complex combinations of human and machine processes - an excellent description of a digital nervous system at work.\n\nDo you view information technology as a way to solve specific problems? Then you're probably only getting a fraction of the benefits that modern computers and software can provide. Instead, you should be creating systems that will deliver information immediately to anyone who can use it - \"digital nervous systems\".\n\nAs the boss of Microsoft, the world's most successful software company, I played a large part in the birth of the Information Age. In this book I explain the idea of a digital nervous system - the use of information technology to satisfy people's needs at work and at home, just as the human nervous system supports the human mind.\n\nLike a living creature, an organization works best if it can rely on a nervous system that sends information immediately to the parts that need it. A digital nervous system can unite all of an organization's systems and processes, releasing rivers of information and allowing businesses to make huge leaps in efficiency, growth, and profits. I have a simple but strong belief: how you gather, manage, and use information will decide whether you win or lose.\n\nThe best way to put distance between your company and the crowd is to do an excellent job with information. There are more competitors today. There is more information available about them and about the market, which is now worldwide. The winners will be the ones who develop a world-class digital nervous system so that information can easily flow through their companies for maximum and constant learning.\n\nI know what you're going to say: no, it's efficient processes! It's quality! It's winning market share and creating brands that are recognized! It's getting close to customers! Success, of course, depends on all of these things. Nobody can help you if your processes aren't efficient, if you don't care about quality, if you don't work hard to build your brand, if your customer service is poor. A bad business plan will fail however good your information is. And bad practice will spoil a good plan. If you do enough things badly, you'll go out of business.\n\nBut whatever else you have on your side today - smart employees, excellent products, loyal customers, cash in the bank - you need a fast flow of good information to make processes efficient, raise quality, and improve the way you put your plan into practice. Most companies have good people working for them. Most companies want to treat their customers well. Good, useful data exists somewhere within most organizations. Information flow is the lifeblood of your company because it enables you to get the most out of your people and to learn from your customers. See if you have the information to answer these questions:\n\n- What do customers think about your products? What problems do they want you to fix? What new features do they want you to add?\n\n- What problems do your partners have as they sell your products or work with you?\n\n- Where are your competitors winning business from you, and why?\n\n- Will customers' changing demands force you to develop new capacities?\n\n- What new markets are appearing that you should enter?\n\nA digital nervous system won't guarantee you the right answers to these questions. But it will free you from the old paper processes so that you'll have the time to think about the questions. It will give you the data to start thinking immediately, and to see the trends coming at you. A digital nervous system will make it possible for facts and ideas to quickly surface from deep in your organization, from the people who have information about these questions and, it's likely, many of the answers. Most important, it will allow you to do all these things fast.\n\nAn old business joke says that if the railroads had understood that they were in the transport business instead of the steel-rail business, we'd all be flying on Union Pacific Airlines. Many businesses have changed their goals in even more basic ways. But it's not always clear where the next growth opportunity is.\n\nMcDonald's has the strongest brand name and market share and a good reputation for quality. But a market analysis recently suggested the company change its business model. McDonald's has occasionally promoted movie-linked toys. The analysis suggested that the company should use its well-known small-profit product to sell the high-profit toys, and not the other way round. Such a change is unlikely, but not unthinkable in today's fast-changing business world.\n\nNo company can assume that its position in the market is safe. A company should constantly be thinking about its options. One company might be hugely successful if it broke into another business. Another company might find that it should stay with what it knows and does best. The most important thing is that a company's managers have the information to understand where they can compete and what their next great market could be.\n\nThis book will help you to use information technology to ask and answer the hard questions about what your business should be and where it should go. Information technology gives you the data that leads to deeper understanding of your business. It enables you to act quickly. It provides solutions to business problems that simply weren't available before. Information technology and business are becoming so tightly linked that you can't talk about one without talking about the other.\n\nThe first step in answering any hard business question is to look at the facts. It's easier to say this than to do it. The principle is illustrated in my favorite business book, My Years with General Motors, by Alfred P Sloan Jr. If you only read one business book, read Sloan's (but don't put this one down to do it). Extraordinary success can follow from positive leadership that's based on information and reason.\n\nDuring Sloan's time as boss, from 1923 to 1956, General Motors became one of the first really complex business organizations in the United States. Sloan understood that a company could not develop a broad business plan or choose the right projects without building on facts and on the understanding of the people in the company. He developed his own understanding of the business by working closely with his staff and by regular personal visits to the company's technical departments. His greatest influence as a manager, however, came from creating working relationships with GM dealers across the country. He constantly gathered information from GM's dealers, and he worked to develop close relationships with them that produced results.\n\nSloan thought that fact-finding trips were very important. So he built an office in a private railroad car and traveled all over the country, visiting dealers. He often saw between five and ten dealers a day. These visits helped Sloan to see that the car business was changing. It was moving from simple selling to trading, as people wanted to trade their old cars when they bought new ones. Sloan saw that GM's relationship with its dealers had to change as well. The manufacturer and the dealers had to become partners. Sloan formed a dealer council to meet regularly with GM's senior executives. He also created a department to handle complaints from the dealers. He paid for economic studies to find the best places for new dealers, and even found a way to lend money to \"capable men\" who did not have the cash to become dealers.\n\nAccurate information about sales was still hard to find. When a dealer's profits went down, GM didn't know why. Without the facts, it was impossible to know what to do. Sloan said he would pay a lot of money so that every dealer \"could know the facts about his business and could intelligently deal with the many details... in an intelligent manner\". This would be \"the best investment General Motors ever made\".\n\nSloan created a standardized system of accounts for the entire GM organization and all its dealers. Every dealer and every employee, at every level of the company, put their numbers into exactly the same categories. By the mid-1930s GM's dealers, its factories, and its offices could all do detailed financial analysis using the same numbers. A dealer, for example, could clearly see how well he was doing and also compare his results to the average across the company.\n\nAn infrastructure that provided accurate information led to a company that responded quickly to events. Other car makers could not compete with GM for decades. This infrastructure - what I call a company's nervous system - helped GM to dominate the car business throughout Sloan's career. It wasn't yet digital, but it was extremely valuable.\n\nOf course, you couldn't get nearly as much information flowing through your company then as you can now. It would have required too many phone calls and too many people moving paper around and looking at the data to find patterns. It would have been very expensive. If you want to run a world-class company today, you have to obtain much more data and do it much faster. To manage with the force of facts - one of Sloan's business principles - requires information technology.\n\nIf information management and quick responses made such a basic difference in a traditional industry seventy years ago, how much more difference will they make when they are powered by information technology? A modern car maker may have a strong brand name and a reputation for quality today but it is facing even greater competition from around the world.\n\nAll car makers use the same steel and the same machines; they have similar manufacturing processes and they have roughly the same transport costs. Today the tests of success are how well they design their products, how intelligently they use information from their customers to improve their products and services, how quickly they can improve their production processes, how cleverly they market their products, and how efficiently they deliver their products and services to customers. All of these processes are rich in information and they benefit from digital technology.\n\nThe value of a digital approach is especially clear in businesses such as banks and insurance companies where information is central to the business. In banking, data about customers is the heart of the business, and banks have always been big users of information technology. Crestar Bank of Richmond, Virginia, offers all its banking services over the Internet. It has bank employees in supermarkets and malls who can offer banking services to customers using digital information flow.\n\nIn the age of the Internet and increasing competition in financial markets, the key to success is the intelligence of a bank's use of data and how well it responds to its customers. It's brains that give one bank or another the advantage. But I don't just mean the individual abilities of bank employees. I mean the overall ability of the bank to make use of the best thinking of all its employees.\n\nAfter the introduction of ENIAC, the first general-purpose computer, during the Second World War, computers quickly proved that they were faster and more accurate than humans at many tasks. Computers were not working at a high level, though. They assisted people but not in an intelligent way. It takes brains to understand the physics of a rocket; it takes a computer to do the sums in seconds.\n\nBusinesses need to do another kind of work, \"information work\". This phrase comes from Michael Dertouzos, director of MIT's laboratory for computer science, and author of What Will Be. We usually think of information-a letter, a picture, or a financial report-as something that doesn't change. But Dertouzos argues that another form of information is active. Information work is the processing of information by human brains or computer programs.\n\nInformation work-designing a building, making a deal, filling in tax forms-is most of the work done in developed countries. Dertouzos estimates that information work contributes 50 to 60 percent of the total value of the goods and services produced by an industrialized country.\n\nDertouzos's idea is important. When computers went from simple number-work to modeling business problems, they began to play a part in information work. Even manufacturing firms have always put more energy into information about the work than into the work itself: information about product design and development; about marketing, sales, and supplies; about payments and finance; about cooperating with sellers; about customer service.\n\nTo do information work, people in the company have to be able to find information easily. Until recently though, we've been told that \"the numbers\" should be reserved for the most senior executives. Sometimes there are good reasons for secrecy, but usually information has been reserved simply because it took time, money, and effort to move information around, so you had to be senior to order the work. On today's computer networks you can find and present data easily and cheaply. You can dive into the data to the lowest level of detail and look at it from different angles. You can exchange information and ideas with other people. You can bring together the ideas and work of many people for a better result.\n\nWe need to stop thinking that getting information and moving information around is difficult and expensive. It's just basic common sense to make all of your company's data easily available to every person who can use it.\n\nAll of a company's employees, not just its high-level executives, need to see business data. It's important for me as a Chief Executive Officer, (CEO), to understand how the company is doing across regions or product lines or different types of customer, and I take pride in staying informed. However, it's the middle managers in every company who need to understand where their profits and losses come from, what marketing programs are working or not, and what expenses are under control or too high. They're the people who need accurate, useful data because they're the ones who need to act. They shouldn't have to wait for upper management to bring information to them. Companies should spend less time protecting financial data from employees and more time teaching them to analyze and act on it.\n\nIn many companies the middle managers can drown in day-to-day problems and not have the information they need to fix them. A sign of a good digital nervous system is that middle managers are made more effective by the flow of accurate, useful information. The systems should tell them about unusual events-for example, if an expense item is too high. Then the managers don't need to look at normal expense activity. Some companies work like this, but I'm constantly surprised by how few companies use information technology to keep their middle managers well-informed and avoid routine review.\n\nI'm amazed by the twisted path that important information often takes through many Fortune 500 companies. At McDonald's, until recently, sales data had to be \"touched\" by hand several times before it made its way to the people who needed it. Today McDonald's is installing a new information system that processes sales at all of its restaurants in real time. As soon as you order two Happy Meals, a McDonald's marketing manager will know. So that manager will have hard facts to analyze sales, not unreliable data.\n\nAs we'll see in the description of Microsoft's reaction to the Internet, another sign of a good digital nervous system is the number of good ideas coming from your middle managers and knowledge workers. When they can analyze real data, people get detailed ideas about how to do things better-and they get excited, too. People like knowing that something they're doing is working and they like being able to show managers that it's working. They enjoy using technology that encourages them to test different theories about what's happening in their markets. People really appreciate information.\n\nA final sign of a good digital nervous system is how effective your face-to-face meetings are. Good meetings are the result of good preparation. Meetings shouldn't be used mainly to present information. It's more efficient to use e-mail so that people can analyze data before the meeting. Then they will be prepared to make suggestions and debate the issues at the meeting itself.\n\nCompanies that are struggling with too many unproductive meetings don't lack energy and brains. The data they need exists somewhere in the company in some form. Digital tools would enable them to get the data immediately, from many sources, and to analyze it from many angles.\n\nGM's Alfred Sloan said that without facts it's impossible to put an effective plan into action. I believe that if you have good facts, you can put an effective plan into action. Sloan did, many times over. At the speed business moves today, we need more than ever to manage with the force of facts.\n\nWhat I'm describing here is a new level of information analysis that enables knowledge workers to turn raw data into active information-what Michael Dertouzos calls knowledge-as-a-verb. A digital nervous system enables a company to do information work with more efficiency, depth, and creativity.\n\nCan your digital nervous system do this?\n\nLike a human being, a company needs an internal communication system, a \"nervous system,\" to organize its actions. All businesses concentrate on a few basic things: customers, products and services, earnings, costs, competitors, delivery, and employees. A company has to carry out the business processes in each area and make sure that they are working together, especially activities that cross departments.\n\nThe sales department needs to find out quickly whether the company can supply a product before promising to deliver a big order. The manufacturing department needs to know what product is selling strongly so that it can change production priorities. Business managers throughout the company need to know about both-and a lot more, too.\n\nAn organization's nervous system has parallels with our human nervous system. Every business has some processes that must continue for the company to survive, just as the human heart must keep beating. The need to be efficient and reliable has driven companies to automate many of these basic operations. But because managers have taken whatever solution was available, the result over time has been a large number of systems that don't always work together. Each independent system may work smoothly on its own, but the data in each is isolated and difficult to combine with the data in the others. Getting data about operational processes and using it has been one of the more difficult problems of business. But today's technology can make basic operations the basis of a much broader, company-wide intelligence.\n\nA company needs to respond quickly and well to any crisis or unplanned event. You might get a call from your best customer saying he's buying from your biggest competitor, or that competitor might introduce a great new product, or you might have a faulty product or an operation that breaks down. Unplanned events can be positive, too. You might get an unexpected opportunity for a major new activity or purchase.\n\nFinally, there's the conscious directing of your company's muscles, whether you're creating teams to develop new products, opening new offices, or sending people out to win new customers. To be carried out well, these planned events need careful thinking and strategic analysis before and after you act.\n\nYou need to think about your company's basic business issues, and develop a long-term business plan to solve problems and take advantage of the opportunities your analysis reveals. Then you need to communicate what you want to do, and the plans behind it, to every person in the company and to partners and other relevant people outside the company.\n\nMore than anything, though, a company has to communicate with its customers and act on what it learns from them. This primary need involves all of a company's capacities: operational efficiency, data gathering, cooperation, strategic planning, and action. The need to communicate with your customers will be emphasized again and again in this book. I'll show how a digital nervous system helps successful companies to do this.\n\nA digital nervous system serves two primary purposes in developing business understanding. It extends the individual's capacity for analysis the way machines extend physical capacities, and it combines the abilities of individuals to create a company intelligence and act as one. To put it all together: A digital nervous system seeks to create company excellence out of individual excellence to serve the customer.\n\nA digital nervous system gives the people working for your company the same kind of data for daily business use that you give to someone you bring in to consult them about a problem. With their years of experience in the industry and their knowledge of business analysis, consultants often come in with new ideas after they have gone through the data. But isn't it crazy that someone outside the company receives more information than you use for yourself? Too often important customer and sales information is pulled together only when a consultant arrives. You should have that information there every day ready to be used by your employees. Your managers should have information of the same quality that the consultant has. As we'll see in the following example, good things happen when they have that information.\n\nAt Microsoft, our sales team calls only on large corporations.\n\nSo every year Jeff Raikes, the man in charge of sales and support, struggles with the problem of how to market to small and medium-sized customers. We usually reach these customers through seminars and marketing with partners. But where are most of these customers? Are they all in the largest cities? Which cities should we choose for marketing?\n\nFrom the Internet, we found the average number of employees per company per city. From outside consultants we got information on the number of personal computers (PCs) per city. From our marketing managers we got information on our seminars and our work with partners. Finally, we included the number of partners per city.\n\nUsing computers, we looked for a match between sales numbers and marketing activity. A Microsoft software program, MS Sales, gave us data in two important areas: last year's sales data, which helped us calculate growth, and income from sales by postal area. We found eighty cities that we thought were likely candidates for a new marketing campaign. But at Microsoft, before we invest money we want to know if the idea will work. We checked the eighty cities again using a marketing program, looking for an eight to one return on investment (ROI). Setting the ROI as high as eight to one would help us take out any cities where the percentage return might be high, but the absolute dollar return would be low. This gave us forty-five cities, later reduced to thirty-eight.\n\nIn each of those thirty-eight cities in which we hadn't done any marketing before, we held two \"Big Day\" events. On each Big Day we showed Microsoft products and made sales offers, with our partners. The ROI was an amazing twenty to one - $30 million return on $1 and half million investment. As the Big Day events happened, we used the MS Sales program to measure our return against figures in similar markets to see if the Big Days were really making a difference. The results: cities in which we did Big Day events showed a 57 percent increase in income against a 16 percent increase in income in a control group of nineteen small cities that did not have Big Days.\n\nToday the program which identified the target cities has been improved, so that anybody in the company can see future sales opportunities not just by area, but by product, too. So instead of a seminar with all Microsoft products, we can find out if one city needs a seminar on Microsoft Office, another on Windows, and a third on Exchange.\n\nAll that was because of the MS Sales program. A paper system could not do that work. The sales data now comes to us in a way that lets us put it into MS Sales immediately. This is inexpensive, and because we share this data with our partners, discussions with them about future marketing plans achieve better results. These discussions are still old fashioned face-to-face meetings, but everybody at those meetings is better prepared because of the data they have seen in advance.\n\nAt Microsoft our information systems have also changed the role of our managers. When MS Sales first came online, one of our managers in Minneapolis checked sales in her area at a level of detail not possible before. She discovered that the excellent total sales figures for her district hid poor sales to large customers. Finding that out came as a shock to the large customer sales team, but it was also the first step toward putting things right. By the end of the year Minneapolis was the fastest growing area for sales to large customers.\n\nIf you're a manager at Microsoft today, you must be more than a good sales team leader. Now you can be a business thinker because you have the data to help you run your business. You can look at sales figures and see where your business is strong and where it is weak, and which products you can sell, in which areas, to which size firms. You can try out new programs and look at the results. You can talk to other managers about what they're doing to get good results. Managers at Microsoft have a much more important role now than they did five years ago because of the easy-to-use computer programs that we've developed.\n\nA digital nervous system gives its users an understanding and an ability to learn things that they would not otherwise have. A good flow of information and good tools for analysis let us see new opportunities for profit among large amounts of data. It makes the best use of the capacities of human brains and reduces human labor.\n\nTo begin creating a digital nervous system, you should first develop an ideal picture of the information you need to run your business and to understand your markets and your competitors. Think hard about the facts you need to know. Develop a list of the most important questions for your business. Then demand that your information systems provide the answers. If your current system won't do this, you need to develop one that will. If you don't, one or more of your competitors will.\n\nYou know you have built an excellent digital nervous system when information flows through your organization as quickly and naturally as thought in a human being, and when you can use technology to organize teams of people as quickly as you can direct an individual. It's business at the speed of thought.\n\nDigital technology can completely change your production processes and your business processes. It can also free workers from slow paper processes. Replacing paper processes with digital processes frees knowledge workers to do more useful work. The all-digital work place is usually called \"the paperless office,\" a phrase that goes back to at least 1973. It's a great vision. No more piles of paper in which you can't find what you need. No more searching through heaps of reports to find marketing information or a sales number. But the paperless office never seems to actually arrive.\n\nThe Xerox Corporation did more to promote the concept than any other company. In 1974-5 it was talking about the \"office of the future\" that would have computers and e-mail with information online. Between 1975 and 1987 several business newspapers promised that the paperless office wasn't far off but in 1988 I told a journalist, \"This vision of a paperless office is still very, very far away\".\n\nToday we have all the pieces in place to achieve the paperless office. Better computers and software make it easy to combine data of various types. Highly capable, networked PCs are everywhere in the office environment. The Internet is connecting PCs around the world. But paper use has continued to double every four years, and 95 percent of all information in the United States remains on paper, compared with just 1 percent stored electronically. Paper is increasing faster than digital technology can reduce it!\n\nIn 1996 I decided to look at ways that Microsoft was still using paper. To my surprise, we had printed 350,000 paper copies of sales reports that year. I asked for a copy of every paper form we used. The thick file that landed on my desk contained hundreds and hundreds of forms. Paper use was only a sign of a bigger problem, though: administrative processes that were too complicated and took too much time.\n\nI looked at the file and wondered, \" Why do we have all these forms? Every person here has a PC. We're connected up. Why aren't we using electronic forms and e-mail\"? As Chief Executive Officer I gave the order to ban all unnecessary forms. In place of all that paper, systems grew up that were more accurate and easier to work with and that freed our people to do more interesting work.\n\nNow, even before we employ a new worker, he or she starts on an electronic journey. We receive career information from 600 to 900 people applying for jobs every day, through the post, by e-mail at resume@microsoft.com. or at the Microsoft website at www.microsoft.com/jobs. Seventy percent of the career information now arrives by e-mail or to the website, up from 6 percent two years ago and rising. All career information from people applying for jobs is matched with open jobs within forty-eight hours, sometimes within twenty-four hours.\n\nA software program sets up job interviews. Every interviewer gets career details of the person applying for the job by e-mail. After the interview each interviewer sends comments on the candidate by e-mail. This sharing of information makes sure that interviewers build on each other's work, not repeat it. If it is obvious that Microsoft wants the candidate, an e-mail signal tells the interviewer to explain to that person why Microsoft would be a good choice for them.\n\nLet's say that someone called Sharon Holloway accepts our job offer. The imaginary Sharon is one of the eighty-five new people we employ each week. We'll say that Sharon is at Redmond, Washington. Before Sharon arrives at Microsoft, an administration assistant in her new department fills out the New Hire form on Microsoft's intranet to request office furniture, and a computer with software, e-mail, and voice mail to be ready for Sharon. The same form makes sure that Sharon's name is added to the company phone list and that she gets a nameplate for her office door and a mailbox in the building's mailroom.\n\nWhen she arrives, Sharon goes online to read the employee handbook (it doesn't exist on paper now) and she downloads any software she needs. Next, Sharon uses a program called MS Market to order office supplies, books, a whiteboard, and business cards. MS Market automatically puts in her name, her e-mail address, and the name of her manager on the order. The suppliers receive her request by e-mail and deliver the supplies to her office. An order above a certain amount of money would automatically go to a manager before it went to the supplier.\n\nSharon's paycheck goes into her account by e-mail and if she wants to she can change her bank online. For travel, Sharon uses a program designed by Microsoft in partnership with American Express, called AXI. It's available online twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nSome people think that \"Microsofties\" have no life outside the company, but actually they do. Sharon gets married and goes on vacation with her new husband. She enters her vacation time online. When she and her husband move into a new house, Sharon enters her new address online once and it is automatically sent to every department that needs her address. She visits our intranet to get information about bus routes and ride sharing in her new neighborhood.\n\nWhen Sharon and her husband have a baby, she goes online to learn about seminars for parents, paid time off work for parents, and day care for children. Microsoft pays a certain amount in benefits to every person the company employs and they can take these benefits in many ways. They can look at different ways of combining benefits online. She can also buy and sell shares online, using the company that buys and sells shares for everybody employed at Microsoft, Saloman Smith Barney. Sharon can buy and sell shares in Microsoft and use her vote as a shareholder online.\n\nUsing our computer network to replace paper forms has produced impressive results for us. As I write this book, we have reduced the number of paper forms from more than 1,000 to a company-wide total of sixty forms. Overall, the savings from using electronic forms have amounted to at least $40 million in our first twelve months of use in 1997-8. The biggest savings came from the reduction in processing costs. Accounting firms put the cost of each paper order - mostly the time of all the people handling the paper - at about $145. Electronic processing at Microsoft costs less than $5 per order.\n\nAs we invented new solutions, our central information-technology budget, which covers these and other major business areas, decreased 3 percent between 1996 and 1999, mostly from standardizing data and reducing the number of information systems we have.\n\nElectronic tools give us benefits beyond reducing costs. For example, our Microsoft Market software asks for authority before it will process a request. This prevents the inappropriate purchases that can easily get through a paper-based system. Delivery information is typed instead of handwritten, so almost nothing is ever sent to the wrong destination. Communication with our suppliers is documented, and we know the costs in advance so there are no surprises. Our suppliers get paid faster, which means they want to deliver quickly. We're always discovering new benefits.\n\nThe move from paper to electronic forms is an essential step in developing a modern organization's nervous system, but you should use the change to improve processes that are central to your business. A digital nervous system is easy to build on. A good network, a good e-mail system, and easy-to-build webpages are everything you need for getting rid of internal paper forms, too. Our internal tools have two goals: to use software to handle routine tasks, so that our knowledge workers don't waste time and energy; and to free people to do more difficult work and handle unusual situations. Our internal developers use the \"sort-boiled egg\" rule: A user must be able to get into and out of most administrative tools within three minutes. This makes sure that we don't create clumsy tools and cause more work overall.\n\nImproving administrative and internal business processes is an important way to improve the overall efficiency of your employees. When you give knowledge workers good internal tools, you also send them an important message: when employees see a company improve efficiency and get rid of time-draining routine administrative tasks, they know that the company values their time and wants them to use it profitably.\n\nIt's easy to measure when you make your factory workers more efficient. It's hard to measure when you make your knowledge workers more effective, but it makes sense that workers who aren't burdened by routine tasks will do better work. The benefit to customers is that your employees spend less time on paperwork and more time on customer needs.\n\nChapter two.\n\nCommerce: The Internet.\n\nChanges Everything.\n\nRide the rocket of change.\n\nNot long ago I gave a talk to the board of directors of a German financial institution. These were experienced businesspeople. The youngest person there was probably fifty-five, and many of them were in their sixties. They'd seen a lot of changes in banking and they'd lived through a lot of technology changes, too. The bank had not yet, though, begun to use the new Internet technologies.\n\nOn the day of my visit they'd heard a series of talks from Microsoft employees about the company. When I walked into the room, they were all sitting there with their arms folded across their chests, looking unhappy.\n\n\"OK,\" I said\". What's the problem\"?\n\nOne of them replied, \"We think that banking is in the process of changing completely, and we're getting technical talks from people here at Microsoft - more technical than we're used to\". He took his glasses off and rubbed his eyes and said, \"This is probably good, although it's making us tired\". After a pause he continued: \"It's good that you're just going to make all of your products better, but what is the overall plan? To view you as a long-term supplier, we need you to give us a vision of the future. What are your organizing principles for development\"?\n\nThe senior Microsoft executive who ends a meeting with customers doesn't usually bring a prepared talk. Instead, the person answers questions and makes a summary of what we'll do in response to any important issues that have come up. So as I stood in front of the German bankers I was thinking, \"Oh boy. We've spent eight hours talking to this bank and we haven't answered the customer's central concerns. Now I've got to do it without notes\"...\n\nBut by that time I'd given my talk on the digital nervous system a couple of dozen times, and I'd been working on this book for almost a year. So I began to write down the major changes that I thought were going to happen with technology in the near future. I was writing down ten changes that I thought would have a significant effect on industries, I told the bankers. These were important changes in customer behavior that were all related to digital technology and were all happening now.\n\n\"I'm going to ask you whether you believe each of them will happen. Don't worry now about how quickly, just tell me whether you believe they're ever going to occur. If you don't believe they will, then you shouldn't change what you're doing with technology. But if you believe they're going to happen, and it's only a matter of time, then you should start to prepare for that change today\".\n\n\"Do you believe that in the future people at work will use computers every day for most of their jobs\"? I asked. \"Today a lot of people use computers occasionally, but many knowledge workers may use their PCs only a few times a day. They may even go a couple of days without using PCs. Do you believe that today's paperwork will be replaced by more efficient digital processes\"? They did.\n\n\"Do you believe that one day most homes will have computers? In the United States today, about half of all homes have PCs. The percentage is a bit higher in some countries but much lower in most others. Do you believe,\" I asked, \"that one day computers will be as common in homes as telephones or TVs\"? They did.\n\n\"Do you believe that one day most businesses and most homes will have high-speed connections to the World Wide Web\"? I asked. They nodded agreement.\n\n\"Do you believe e-mail will become as common a method of communication among people in business and homes as the telephone or paper mail is today? Today not everybody uses e-mail even if they have a computer. Will that situation change\"? They agreed that it would.\n\n\"Now, if most people have computers and use them every day,\" I asked, \"do you believe that most information will start arriving in digital form? Do you think your bills will arrive electronically? Do you think you'll be booking your travel arrangements over the Internet\"? They agreed that these changes were coming.\n\n\"Do you think digital equipment will become common\"? I asked. \"Do you think that all phones, cameras, videos, and TVs will soon be digital? Do you think that other new machines will appear in the home and be connected to the Web\"? It was only a matter of time, they agreed.\n\n\"Do you see a time coming when notebook computers become computer notebooks\"? I described what I meant: a computer notebook is a new machine that enables you to take notes as you do today on paper and lets you carry with you all the personal and professional data you need. This will probably be the last change to occur. \"The great thing about a computer notebook,\" I said, \"is that however much you put into it, it doesn't get bigger or heavier\". They laughed. There was a thirty-second conversation in German before one of them said, \"We thought you said something funny, and then we realized you said something important\".\n\n\"Am I wasting your time\"? I asked. \"Do you believe these changes are ever going to happen\"? By now we were beginning to have a conversation. They had a short talk among themselves in German. The banker who had spoken before said, \"We've been talking about the same things at home and, yes, we believe it's going to happen. When it does, it's going to completely change the nature of banking\".\n\n\"When do you think it is going to happen\"? I asked. They had another, longer conversation in German. Then they said, \"We didn't expect to make this decision here, but we have. We were going to tell you twenty years, but then we decided that within ten years these changes will either have arrived or becoming very soon. Banking will be completely different\".\n\n\"To prepare for that change,\" I told them, \"you need to make digital information flow everywhere in your organization\". I talked briefly about the need to use the digital tools that they already had for their knowledge workers. I talked about digitally linking their knowledge systems with business information systems to create a new infrastructure around the PC and Internet technologies. If they did these things, I told them, they would be prepared for the three basic business changes that will occur as the result of all the technological advances:\n\n1: Most of the contact between business and customers, business and business, and people and government will become digital and self-service.\n\n2: Customer service will become the primary way of adding value in every business. Human involvement in service will shift from routine, low-value tasks to high-value personal service to the customer.\n\n3: The speed of digital operations and the need for more personal attention to customers will encourage companies to adopt digital processes internally if they have not yet adopted them for efficiency reasons. Companies will use a digital nervous system to regularly adapt their internal business processes to an environment that constantly changes because of customer needs and competition.\n\nComplex customer-service and business problems would require powerful computers on both sides of the relationship - customer and employee-I said. The new relationships would be helped by various electronic aids such as voice, video, and interactive use of the same computer screen. We'd see a world in which fairly simple personal-companion computers became common alongside extremely powerful general-purpose PCs that support knowledge work at home or the office.\n\n\"Microsoft's vision,\" I ended by saying, \"is to provide software that links all these digital machines together and enables people to create digital solutions based on the Web lifestyle. It's as simple as that\".\n\nThe German bank board had a final question for me, which is the question on everyone's mind: what should they do personally to get ready for this new digital world? My answer was: use the tools yourselves. Senior executives should use e-mail and other electronic tools to get familiar with the new way of doing things.\n\nThey should see what their competitors' Internet sites look like. They should become Internet users. Buy some books and arrange some travel over the Internet, I told them, and see what it's like. If you're going to lead the digital age, you need to become familiar enough with the Internet to be able to imagine what the Web lifestyle will mean for your industry-even if the change is going to take years.\n\nFor years and years enthusiasts have been saying that the Internet will happen \"tomorrow\". You're going to keep reading predictions that the big change will happen in the next twelve months. This is just garbage. The social changes that have to occur take years, and the infrastructure has to be extended. But when the social and technical changes reach a certain point, the change will be quick and permanent. The point will come where the Web lifestyle really will take off, and I believe that's some time in the next five years. As I said in The Road Ahead, we always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten. Don't let yourself be fooled into doing nothing.\n\nIt's hard to think of a business category in which the Internet won't have an effect or in which there aren't already new Internet companies. Lots of firms now wish they were the first Internet book store or travel agency, winning the first customers, the public enthusiasm, the famous name.\n\nInternet companies are not just learning new ways to do business. They are also rushing to break down the barriers between different areas of business. Amazon.com, which began as an Internet bookseller, has begun to sell CDs. There's no reason for Amazon not to sell other products as well. The initial reason for your company to go onto the Web might be to obtain cost savings and attract new customers. When you have customers interacting with you, you have an amazing ability to build on that relationship to offer a broader set of products.\n\nAn Internet business is not like a bank branch where you can train employees on only a small number of products. The virtual nature of the Internet enables whatever shopping your customers want to do. You'll see more companies like Amazon, that are strong in one online area and then expand their product offerings. The warning to every business is that even if no one in your industry jumps in early, big online companies, trying to cover every commercial area, will move into yours.\n\nLearn about the Internet today. Find some of your customers who are already adopting the Web lifestyle. Use this group to develop models for how you might do business overall. Within a decade most of your other customers will have made the shift, and you'll be prepared.\n\nThe middleman must add value\n\nHere at the start of the twenty-first century, a basic new rule of business is that the Internet changes everything. Internet technologies are altering the way every company, even a small one, deals with its employees, partners, and suppliers.\n\nNot every company needs to use the Internet to interact with its customers right now, but soon a company website where customers can do business with the firm will be as essential as the telephone and a mailing address have been. Already the great majority of Fortune 500 companies have websites. The Internet is reducing costs and changing the relationships of companies with their customers. The Internet produces more competition among sellers and helps sellers to find possible customers.\n\nIn pre-Internet days, the only way customers could get goods from most manufacturers was through layers of middlemen.\n\nToday customers can do business directly with manufacturers eager to offer Internet service. Today any manufacturer can provide the Internet version of a factory store.\n\nBefore the Internet, gathering all the information for financial services, travel options, and other products required lots of time. Huge numbers of service companies made their money by collecting and organizing that kind of information for customers. Today, despite search tools that aren't perfect, customers can go to the Internet to find much more of the information they need. And any company can provide valuable information cheaply on the Internet, without branch offices.\n\nIn 1995, in The Road Ahead, I described how the Internet is helping to create Adam Smith's ideal market, in which buyers and sellers can easily find one another without taking much time or spending much money. The first problem in most markets is finding someone to do business with. The second problem is understanding the nature and quality of the goods and services that are being offered. The Internet makes it easy for a buyer to get background information about a product and to compare prices easily. Buyers can also tell sellers more about what they require, and sellers will be able to target their goods at the people who are most interested in them and sell related products.\n\nThe Internet is a great tool for helping customers to find the best deal they can. It is quite easy for buyers to jump from one website to another to find the best prices on some goods. At least two different services provide price comparisons for customers shopping for goods such as books and CDs. Some travel sites feature automated bargain finders that can find low air fares. At least one company, Priceline.com, reverses the buyer-seller relationship by having buyers bid the price they're willing to pay for a car or a plane ticket and offering that price to various sellers. It is unclear yet how broadly this approach will be used, but it is possible only through the Internet.\n\nOver time, software will automate price comparisons even more, until they become effortlessly electronic. At least one online store already checks other major sites for the prices of commonly purchased items and automatically reduces its prices to make sure that they're always slightly lower. Without stores to pay for, the seller may still make a profit. Customers will be able to join together electronically to get lower prices in ways that have not been easy before. There will even be cases in which software representing the seller negotiates with software representing hundreds or thousands of customers.\n\nFor the majority of products which are available through many stores, customers will benefit most. For unique products and services, sellers will find more possible customers and may charge higher prices. The more customers adopt the Web lifestyle, the closer the economy will move toward Adam Smith's perfect market in all areas of commerce.\n\nCustomers can now deal directly with manufacturers and service providers, so there is little value added in simply transferring goods or information. Various people have predicted \"the death of the middleman\". Certainly the value of some kinds of middleman is quickly falling to zero. Travel agents who simply book air fares will disappear. This kind of high-volume, low-value dealing is perfect for a self-service Internet travel site. In the future travel agents will need to do more than book tickets; they will need to create a total travel adventure. A travel agent who provides highly personalized tours of Italy or the California wine country will still be in great demand.\n\nIf you're a middleman, the Internet's promise of cheaper prices and faster service can end your role of assisting the contact between the producer and the customer. If this is happening to you, one option is to use the Internet to get back into the action. That's what Egghead, a major chain of software stores, did after struggling for several years. Egghead closed all of its physical stores in 1998 and began selling just on the Internet. Egghead now offers a number of new online programs that take advantage of the Internet, such as electronic sales for about fifty different categories of hardware and software, and for used computers. It's not yet clear whether Egghead will succeed and meet the test described in this chapter, which is that the middleman must add value, but the company certainly understands the principle.\n\nEvery store needs to take the Internet into account. The success of the Amazon.com bookstore, which exists only on the Internet, caused Barnes & Noble to combine its successful physical bookstores with a strong online presence, and to start working with Bertelsmann, a leading international media company.\n\nFor service industries, the Internet requires you to be either a high-volume, low-cost provider, or a provider of highly personalized services. For the high-volume, low-cost model, you use Internet technology to create a self-service approach. You make a lot of information available to customers and you drive a lot of traffic through your Internet site by offering the best price. Because only a few companies in any market will be the high-volume players, most companies will have to find ways to use the Internet not just to reduce costs, but also to deliver new services.\n\nE-Trade Securities started low-cost finance services on the Internet in 1992. By 1998 at least seventy companies bought and sold shares for their customers online, and the number was going up. Finance firms that still offer a service face-to-face or over the phone have a problem: most of the data about shares that these companies provide for their customers is available free on the Internet. But if the companies that do not offer an Internet service become electronic traders (e-traders), what can they do that is different to what customers are already offered?\n\nMerrill Lynch, the market-leading finance company, asked itself exactly that question when it looked at the way it did business in 1997. Customers have invested with Merrill Lynch for more than a century. The company has managed their shares by getting large amounts of financial data, analyzing it, and making long-term financial plans. By 1997 customers had more than one trillion dollars invested with Merrill Lynch. But the growth of low-cost trading and then Internet-based trading between 1992 and 1997 showed managers that the company would have to change. As Howard Sorgen of Merrill Lynch said, \"Our customers were changing. The way people got information and made decisions was changing. We would have been foolish to think we didn't have to change, too\".\n\nMerrill Lynch's main assets are its financial consultants, the people who advise clients about their investments. But in 1997 they were spending a lot of their time finding data and not enough time advising clients about their investments. The information systems at that time were expensive and hard to use. All the different categories of data-share prices, product information, the customer database, pricing - were on different systems, and all of them were incompatible and difficult to use. The new information system was built round the financial consultants. It helped them get data and develop the best financial plan for the client as quickly as possible. To save money and development time the company also wanted to use existing products when possible.\n\nMerrill Lynch managers asked their board for a billion dollars to invest in new technology. The board agreed that the best way to compete was to give the company's knowledge workers - the financial consultants-the best knowledge tools. So the managers got permission for what became a five year, $825 million project. This was completed on time in October 1998 for close to the $825 million estimate. Of that cost, about $250 million went on software development. Much of the remaining expense - a system for getting share prices and market news, for example - would have been required whatever software Merrill Lynch used. The actual difference in cost was about $250 million over four years. For slightly more than $60 million a year, approximately $3,500 per financial consultant, Merrill Lynch improved the information system for the 14,700 financial consultants in its 700 US offices and for another 2,000 consultants internationally.\n\nChief Technical Officer Howard Sorgen showed me the Merrill Lynch solution. All systems are now fully compatible. All financial information, from any source, is organized into \"pages\" and then \"books\". The financial consultant can look anywhere in these books - at share prices on NASDAQ, New York, and Tokyo, for example. The financial consultant can see immediately if all the client's shares are doing well or badly and why. Before, this took a lot of time as shares in each company were looked at individually. Now, the financial consultant can even see immediately what would happen if one lot of shares was bought and another sold. Soon clients will be able to see these calculations on their own PC screens. Also, the system behaves like a well-trained assistant to the financial controller. If the controller's client has shares in a company, the system will put background data about the company on the screen without being asked, whenever the controller asks for the share price.\n\nSince the changes in the system at Merrill Lynch, financial consultants have more time to build stronger relationships with clients. Merrill Lynch then decided that giving more information to clients would make the relationship with them stronger, not weaker.\n\nMerrill Lynch Online is a version of the Merrill Lynch system for customers. It gives the customer some background data on which decisions are based, and it also has basic information about the client's account with Merrill Lynch. The company hoped to get 200,000 customers in the first year, an average of about 550 people a day. Instead, 700 to 800 people a day went online with the system. One surprise was the age of the customers who took the system first. Merrill Lynch thought that the younger customers who had grown up with the Internet would try the system first, but the older, wealthier clients were the first customers.\n\nAfter the first success, Merrill Lynch added more to the online service. Today, customers can e-mail their financial consultants, look at the latest share prices, and buy and sell shares. Merrill Lynch now see the Internet as an opportunity, not a threat. It gives the client information, but financial information is not financial knowledge. That is still provided by the financial consultants, who now have more time to concentrate on it. And they provide it to well-informed clients, who ask better questions than badly-informed clients. The aim now is to have the client and the financial consultant looking at the same data on screen at the same time. Then, as Merrill Lynch people like to say, \"the real magic starts\".\n\nTouch your customers.\n\nAs electronic commerce grows, not only middlemen will find creative ways to use the Internet to strengthen their relationships with customers. The businesses that treat e-commerce as more than a way to easy money will do the best. Sales are the final goal, of course, but the sale itself is only one part of the online customer experience. Some companies will use the Internet to interact with their customers in ways that haven't been possible before. They will make the sale part of a series of customer services for which the Internet has unique strengths.\n\nIt's important that customers come away from electronic interactions pleased enough to tell their friends. This is the most powerful means by which any product or company builds a reputation, and the Internet is a medium made for easy communication. If a customer doesn't like a product or the way a trader has treated him, he's likely to e-mail all of his friends. An Internet car site called Autoweb.com asks customers about dealer service by e-mail, and removes dealers from its lists if they fail to improve their service as a result of complaints.\n\nToday, the main competition for online stores is physical stores. Physical stores have much higher sales volumes than online stores. Online sales in 1998 were only 0,5 percent of the total sales in the world's seven largest economies. But that percentage will grow enormously in the next decade. As e-commerce takes off, the main competition for Internet sites will no longer be physical stores but other online stores.\n\nRapidly growing categories for online commerce include finance and insurance, travel, and computer sales. Companies such as Cisco Systems, Dell Computer, and Microsoft are now doing billions of dollars each in business over the Internet every year. Chrysler expects its 1,5 percent online sales volume to jump to 25 percent in four years. Even the most cautious estimates project an annual growth rate of about 45 percent for online sales. The highest estimates were for more than $1,6 trillion in business by the year 2000. I think this is too low.\n\nDell was one of the first big companies to move into e-commerce. The company supplies computers worldwide, selling more than $18 billion worth of products. It began selling its products online in mid-1996. Its online business quickly rose from $1 million a week to $1 million a day. Soon it jumped to $3 million a day and then $5 million. It is still rising. Computer buyers clearly like and find it easy to buy their computers on the Web. At the time of writing, Dell has more than 1,5 million visits a week to its website, and 11 percent of its business is online. Dell hoped that this would grow to 50 percent, maybe as early as 2000.\n\nMichael Dell, who started the company, believes in direct selling and computer-aided commerce. But he knows that the Internet has to be a basic part of the overall business strategy. Dell's entire business is based on online commerce and support. Dell's first site provided product information, let customers buy online, and asked for customer ideas. Dell learned a lot from the suggestions that came in, mainly online. Over time Dell has made hundreds of changes to its website. Customers can do more and more online. They can now see online the progress of the product they have ordered.\n\n\"The Internet doesn't replace people. It makes them more efficient,\" says Michael Dell. \"We had to build an Internet system that was so convenient, customers got more value for their time than they did on the phone\".\n\nHaving more information online for customers didn't reduce the value of Dell's sales team. Like Merrill Lynch, Dell found out that an educated customer is a better customer. Dell's sales team became more like consultants to the customer. And they have more time for consulting because buying and selling online is so much quicker.\n\nOne of Dell's unique approaches to customer support was to create more than 5,000 individually designed pages for its big customers. About 65 percent of Dell's online business is from individuals and small businesses, and the Premier pages are one way that Dell is growing its corporate business. They make large purchases online easier and quicker.\n\nOnly Information Technology (IT) can balance the need to keep enough stock to supply customers quickly with the cost of keeping too much stock. Perfect information about what the customer needs is the answer to the need for zero stock waiting for an order.\n\nMarriott International, the world's largest hotel company, earns more than $10 billion from its 1,500 hotels around the world under ten different brands. The hotels have had an online booking system since 1996, and although Marriott says the system was simple and just an experiment, it did $1 million in business by the end of the year.\n\nMarriott saw that the Internet could do even more, and in early 1997 they created a special Internet team. From the start, the technology team worked closely with the business team. Studies showed that one of the subjects people wanted information about most was travel. \"The Internet is all about service,\" says Marriott's Mike Pusateri, \"providing service to customers in a way that is faster, friendlier, and more personal than they or the company has ever experienced before. And service is Marriott's business\".\n\nMarriott was one of the first companies to build an interactive home page on its website. You can search online for a Marriott hotel by asking for hotels in a certain city, for hotels with certain facilities, and for hotels that have certain features in their rooms. Linked pages show attractions close to the hotel, for example a golf course. Or, if you want to go to a Chinese restaurant, the system will list the six nearest. When you have chosen your hotel, you can find out about prices and book a room. There are also links to other sites that book rooms, like TravelWeb.com and Microsoft Expedia.com. Marriott's site has links to 1,000 other webpages.\n\nBecause each visitor searches for exactly what he or she wants on the Marriott website, each visitor has a different experience. The website is visited by 15,000 people a day, which brought in more than $2 million a month in money from Internet sources in 1997. It's hard for Marriott to know what percentage of this return would have come in anyway, by traditional methods, but it is clear that the Internet is attracting wealthier customers who prefer its more expensive hotels. On average, an online customer spends more with Marriott than the average customer.\n\nMarriott has found, as others have found, that the more interactive a site is, the more business activity it gets from its visitors. For example, instead of floor plans future customers see virtual pictures of the hotel. Soon customers will be able to enter the place they want to stay and the names of other Marriott hotels they have stayed in. The site will then give them the nearest Marriott hotel that is like the hotel they enjoyed before.\n\nMarriott does not cut out middlemen, it makes them part of its customer service. The company provides special places on its website for travel agents and meeting planners. Thousands of meeting planners view the Marriott site because they don't have to visit the hotel before they make a decision on where to have their meeting.\n\nAdopt the Web lifestyle.\n\nIf you asked your friends why they use the phone to communicate with their friends, or why they turn to the television for entertainment or breaking news, they'd look at you in a strange way. If you asked your friends whether they'd adopted \"the electricity lifestyle,\" they'd think you were crazy.\n\nPeople in developed countries don't think much about their electrical products, we just use them. But people who are now in their fifties can remember when just a few families had TVs. Our grandparents can remember when much of rural America was without electricity. It's taken more than a hundred years for the electricity lifestyle to revolutionize civilization.\n\nWhen streets and houses were first wired, the only use for electricity was for lighting. Electricity's capacity to change everyone's lifestyle was hidden. Electric light was cleaner, safer, brighter, and more convenient than natural gas, oil, or candles. When the infrastructure was in place, though, new products were created that took advantage of electricity. Electric refrigerators, record players, and air conditioners applied the new technology to existing needs. The most revolutionary uses of electricity were the phone, the radio, and the TV. These new machines changed our economies and our lifestyles. People hadn't dreamed of these products before the infrastructure was available.\n\nBecause the Internet is a communications infrastructure that depends on electricity, you could say that its popular acceptance is an extension of the electricity lifestyle. But the Internet is enabling a new way of life that I call \"the Web lifestyle\". The Web lifestyle, like the electricity lifestyle, will be characterized by new things happening quickly. The infrastructure for high-speed communications is producing new software and hardware that will change people's lives.\n\nIntelligent machines such as the PC are becoming more powerful and less expensive. Since they are programmable, they can be used for many different tasks. Within a decade most Americans and many other people around the world will be living the Web lifestyle. It will be natural for these people to turn to the Web to get news, to learn, to be entertained, and to communicate. It will be just as normal as picking up the phone to talk to somebody or to order something. The Web will be used to pay your bills, manage your finances, communicate with your doctor, and do any business. Just as naturally, you'll carry one or more small machines using a radio connection to stay constantly in touch and do electronic business wherever you are.\n\nFor a lot of people the Web lifestyle is very close today. By 1998 more than sixty million Americans were using the Web regularly, up from twenty-two million the year before. By 1998 the average user went on the Web eight to nine separate times a month, spending a total of about three and a half hours a month online. It's exciting to see that people living the Web lifestyle are using the Internet to learn and buy in new ways. When the Sojourner landed on Mars in the summer of 1997, NASA's website had forty-seven million hits in four days from people seeking more detail than they could get from the traditional news media.\n\nBusinesses are providing a wide variety of information and services, like real-time stock quotes, sports scores, and city guides. You can buy almost anything on the Web, from paintings to old toys. The Web is an ideal vehicle for helping to build a community, too. There are sites for tracking missing children, for helping people adopt pets, and for every pastime that you can imagine. Sites that involve citizens are getting excellent traffic flow.\n\nA cultural change as significant as a move to the Web lifestyle will depend on the age of users to some degree. The kids growing up with the new technology will show us the full possibilities. Personal computer use, high-speed networks, and online communication are widespread. Universities are getting rid of paper forms and registering students for classes over the Web. Students can look at their grades and even send in work over the Web. Teachers hold online discussion groups. Students e-mail friends and family as naturally as they call them on the phone.\n\nThe adoption of technology for the Web lifestyle is happening faster than the adoption of electricity, cars, TV, and radio. Many people who use PCs at the office install them at home for work, and then use them for much more. A lot of people over fifty-five years old, who wouldn't usually add new technology to their lifestyle, want to use the Internet as a way to stay in touch with their friends and families. Revolutionary new uses of the Internet that none of us can accurately predict today will change the world as completely in the twenty-first century as the unexpected uses of electricity did in the twentieth-and faster.\n\nAs people move rapidly online, one of the most basic changes will be the degree to which customers will manage their finances online. In 1998 only about one million of the fifteen billion total bills in the United States were paid electronically. Little online customer service was available. In fact, though customers can pay some bills online, in almost every case they still receive them on paper. When customers are able to pay online, the US Commerce Department estimates, processing costs will drop more than $20 billion annually. Today you have to calculate on paper what bills you want to pay and how much you want to pay on each. In the future, software will enable you to calculate online the effect of various payments on your bank balance. You'll make your payment exactly when it's due. And bill payment software will communicate with financial management software.\n\nBy late 1998 about half of all American homes had PCs, and about half of those PCs were connected to the Web. The percentages are lower in most other countries. Reducing the cost of high-speed communications so people can remain constantly connected, and making the software easier to use, are essential to making the Web lifestyle common. I believe that by the year 2001 more than 60 percent of US homes will have PCs and that 85 percent of those homes will be online. For other countries to reach these levels of use they will have to invest heavily in communications infrastructure.\n\nPeople don't realize how much the hardware and software will improve. Take just one example: screen technology. I do my electronic mail on a fifty-centimeter flat screen. It's not available at a reasonable price yet, but in two or three years it will be. In five years a hundred-centimeter flat screen will be affordable. Screen quality will have a big effect on how much people will read on the screen instead of on paper.\n\nThe cost of a personal computer is also coming down. Historically, the PC industry has concentrated on creating a more powerful PC at a particular price. Now advances are reducing prices as well. Capable PCs cost much less than $1,000 today, and lower prices are expanding the market. Looking at a ten-year time frame, you're going to have PCs that cost the same as a typical TV. In fact, the difference between a TV and a PC will be small because even the boxes that connect TVs to the cable system will have a processor more powerful than the one we have today in the most expensive PC.\n\nSmaller personal companions will become common. These will include the small PCs on the market today, and new PCs that are the size of a wallet, which will enable electronic operations. The phone, radio, and TV will pick up new capabilities as they go digital. Some machines will be carried with you. Some will be in different rooms in your house. Others will become standard in vehicles.\n\nAny of them will enable you to use e-mail and voice mail, get information from stock reports or other news, and find out the latest weather and news of your flight. These machines will connect through wires or through technologies that don't use wires, such as radio. Though the machines will operate independently, they will exchange data among themselves automatically.\n\nThese machines will become part of ordinary life. When you leave the office for the day, your personal digital companion will download your e-mail, which might include a grocery list from your husband or wife. At the store, you can download a new recipe, and all of the items for the meal will be added to your list. Your digital companion is smart enough to speak to all the machines that need to know your home or work schedule, but only tells the kitchen machines about the recipe. From a computer in the kitchen, you check the house. A video of the front door area shows who called when no one was home.\n\nDigital security cameras connected to a network are becoming cheaper and will be common to reduce theft. Some schools are providing cameras to enable parents to check on their kids while they're at school.\n\nWhile dinner is cooking, you go to a private website for your extended family, and find out that everyone has been in the chat room discussing what to do when the family meets. They used electronic voting to choose half a dozen possible events, and they've asked you to book as many of them as you can. A software agent, which knows you have already booked travel for the trip, suggests several things to do locally, including sailing, which was on your family's list. The agent also tells you about a new, lower air fare to your destination. You digitally book the sailing and the lower fares.\n\nWhen you're ready to watch TV, you might look at the electronic programming guide on screen or use another software agent to see what's on. You've told the agent your viewing tastes and it's tracked your actual viewing patterns, so it recommends several shows among the hundreds available on digital TV. You choose to see a football game. While watching, you use the interactive menu to enter a contest and to vote for the most valuable player. Viewer scores will count for half the final result. You watch a commercial advertising a car. Most viewers see a commercial for a truck, but data that you have volunteered through your TV indicates that you're a better candidate for a family vehicle.\n\nDevelopment of intelligent, interactive TV will come as television moves to digital technology. Digital broadcasts are easy to correct for errors, and allow high-quality video and sound. Digital TV can do a lot more than improve broadcast quality, though. Satellite and cable companies are already using digital TV to deliver more channels. Over time, the biggest effect of digital TV will come from the ability to include other digital data, providing interactivity, intelligent software, targeted advertising and sales offers, and the Web.\n\nBroadcasters will provide greater content such as links to relevant websites or entirely new Web content that adds to the broadcast, or music, or software that can be downloaded for a fee. Many of the new features require a two-way link, which is easy for the new cable TV systems. New technology will make the TV interface easier. Trying to record one or more programs at certain times and days remains annoyingly complex. In the future, taping a show will be as simple as telling the TV exactly what you want to tape. Using speech to interact with the TV, PC, or other personal companions will be common within ten years.\n\nBandwidth, the information-carrying capacity of a digital communications system, remains the biggest barrier to the widespread adoption of the Web lifestyle in all countries. Bandwidth is also the biggest cost. In developed nations businesses can generally afford the bandwidth they need to work digitally because lots of communications companies are wiring business districts. But it will take much longer to get affordable wiring into homes, schools, and libraries, which is critical to achieving a fully connected society. We will only see the benefits of a Web lifestyle when high-bandwidth systems are in place. The most important step for a country to achieve a high-bandwidth infrastructure is to encourage competition in the communications industry.\n\nScientists all over the world are exploring new communications technologies - and old ones. Recently a British engineer developed a way to send high-speed voice and data signals on ordinary electrical current, raising the possibility that Internet service could one day ride into your home over our existing infrastructure of electrical wires. This and other technologies such as satellite broadcasting are exciting because they don't require us to replace the existing wiring that already connects most homes in the developed world. It's a huge task to get the Web infrastructure in place all over the world, but the advances in many areas make it likely that the speed of improvement will surprise everyone in the next decade.\n\nThe social effects of the Web lifestyle will be enormous. A lot of people fear that computers and the Internet will make life less personal, creating a world that's less warm and friendly. Some people were afraid, at first, that the telephone would reduce face-to-face contact, too. Two people might call each other when they would have talked face-to-face without the phone, and two people might e-mail each other when they would have met face- to-face without e-mail.\n\nAny medium can be misused. The development of personal and professional manners for the Web will continue. It's easy enough to say that the Web lifestyle, with everyone in his or her little world, will cause society to fly apart. I believe the opposite is actually true. Just as the phone and e-mail have increased contact between people living in different communities, the PC and the Internet give us another way to communicate. They don't take any away.\n\nIn reality, the ability to use the Internet to move or change the boundaries of our communities is strengthening personal and cultural connections. The city of Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, has Internet discussions about issues like city planning, safety, and drugs. Citizens can connect to the police by e-mail. An Egyptian site for children called the Little Horus website contains more than 300 pages of information and pictures covering Egypt's 7,000 years of civilization. It also has information about Egypt today, including its economic, cultural, and social life. The \"Tour\" section includes tips on popular destinations for children.\n\nThe Web lifestyle is about broadening horizons, not narrowing them. Building communities is going to be one of the biggest growth areas in the next few years on the Web. The Web dramatically increases the number of communities you can join.\n\nIn the past you might have had time to be a part of your neighborhood community and one or two social organizations. In the Web lifestyle you are limited only by your interests.\n\nOne of the most powerful effects of the Web is the way it can connect groups of people independent of geography or time zones. If you want to get together a group of enthusiastic card players or talk about issues with people who share your political views, the Web makes it easy to do. If you want to follow what's happening in your hometown, the Web can help.\n\nHow are we going to find the time to live a Web lifestyle and join more communities? The Web will make things more efficient than they used to be. You can quickly find out how much your used car is worth, plan a trip, or find out anything you need to know when you want to make a major purchase. These things are easy on the Web today. And people will probably trade some of the time they now spend reading the paper or watching TV for the information or entertainment they'll find on the Web. A British study in 1998 showed that about 25 percent of the British adults who used the Internet watched less television than they did before.\n\nMuch of this book is about having all the information we want at the tips of our fingers. Most people want to find the best price for a product or to be up-to-date on the important issues affecting their local or national communities. We have managed without this information because obtaining it has simply been too difficult. The Web lifestyle isn't about changing human nature or the basics of how people live. Instead the Web lifestyle gives more people a chance to pursue their interests in a better way.\n\nThe Web lifestyle will change the way people shop. With the Web as the world's biggest collection of shopping malls, customers will have choices they didn't have before. They'll be able to find all the choices for goods they want and, in many cases, have them specially made. They can have the final product delivered directly to their doors. Because customers are demanding faster and more personal service, and stronger relationships, the Web lifestyle will drive companies to develop a digital nervous system in order to stay with their competitors.\n\nThe Web connects workers, friends, and families in new ways. Communities based on shared interests are forming with members from all over the world. Governments have the chance to involve citizens more than ever before. By enabling people to shop, get news, meet one another, be entertained, and gossip in ways we're only now beginning to understand, the Internet is becoming the town square for the village that the world will be tomorrow.\n\nWith a Web lifestyle, people can overcome many of the barriers that have existed for so long that we almost take them for granted. The Web lifestyle is not about adding complexity to already busy lives. As people become accustomed to the Web lifestyle, they'll eventually accept it unthinkingly, just as they do the electricity lifestyle they live today.\n\nChange the boundaries of business\n\nA flow of digital information changes the way people, organizations, and businesses work. Internet technologies will also change the boundaries of organizations of all sizes. In changing the boundaries, the \"Web workstyle\" of using digital tools and processes enables both organizations and individuals to change their roles. A corporation can use the Internet to work smoothly with professionals such as lawyers and accountants who remain \"outside\" the company walls. An important reengineering principle is that companies should concentrate on their basic skills and outsource everything else. The Internet allows a company to do this to a greater extent than ever before by changing which employees work within the walls and which work outside in a different role.\n\nOur basic skills at Microsoft are creating high-volume software products, working with other software companies, and providing customer service and support. We outsource a number of functions that don't fall into those categories, from help-desk technical support for our employees to the physical production of our software packages. The Web workstyle makes it possible to deal better with unpredictable demand. Because you have a great need for a skill, and then you don't, for some areas you want to be able to hire staff for a short time to deal with peaks and valleys. The Internet means that more companies can take a \"studio\" approach to running major parts of their businesses. Big Hollywood studios have full-time employees to handle finance, marketing, and other continuous projects, but the creative side of the business, the full-time movie-making staff, isn't very big at all. When a movie concept is agreed upon, a director brings together a large group of people to create the film. When they're finished, they move on to other projects.\n\nWeb technology makes it possible for many different kinds of projects to be structured as studio-type work. A project owner who wants to hire a team can go online, describe the project, and find out who's available. People and organizations with the right skills can declare their interest, and the project owner can build a team quickly. People looking for work will find more opportunities for employment that meets their particular interests and needs-if they have highly specialized skills, for example, or if they want to work only certain hours.\n\nDespite these changes, big firms won't break themselves down into project-by-project production companies. Big companies will continue to balance the load of their work as they always have - they'll just use technology to do it more efficiently. Every company will experiment to find its most efficient size and organizational structure, though the trend will be toward smaller companies. Medium-size and small companies can take advantage of the boundary-changing possibilities of the Web to act much bigger than they are, without adding employees or offices. A small company with the right skills can bid on and lead a movie production, a construction job, or an advertising project. By joining with other companies and professionals quickly, it can act as a virtual large company to work on the project until its profitable end. Because the team can be broken up at the end of the project, the company can manage labor resources without the administrative burden of a large full-time staff.\n\nSome employees in companies of any size are naturally nervous about the effects of the Web workstyle. They assume that if their company chooses to build itself around Web technologies, their jobs may disappear. They won't - unless \"restructuring\" is just a fancy term to hide sackings. When a company downsizes, jobs are lost. When a company outsources, jobs move. The goal is not to get rid of work, but to move the responsibility to specialists outside. It's much more efficient for many companies, including Microsoft, to have an outside company handle installation and support for small computers, for example, because companies that specialize in such work can develop world-best skills and because we can ask for competitive bids for the job.\n\nEmployees who react to the possibility of outsourcing with fear are assuming that work belongs \"in\" the company and not \"out\". As companies change, some people will have difficulties. Despite the understandable anxiety, employees should also look at the changes as opportunities to define their jobs the way they want them, and to work for an organization of the size and personality they prefer. They can even use this revolution as a chance to start their own business. Not long ago, one person who had been a writer watched Microsoft outsource writing work and recognized an opportunity. Today this person has a fine business managing a dozen or more writers, and Microsoft staff spend their time defining the work to be done instead of trying to manage the writing process for a bunch of different people. Overall the changes in organizational structure will be good for good employees.\n\nThe Web workstyle is particularly well-suited to lawyers, doctors, accountants, and engineers, who usually work independently or in small teams. One of the reasons professionals have traditionally organized themselves into firms is to deal with the rises and falls of customer demand. Now, instead of joining together to make sure the workload is shared, they'll also have the choice of working on their own and using the Internet to find customers.\n\nNot everyone will choose this approach. A lot of people want to work for bigger firms. They like the idea of belonging to one company, working on long-term projects, and being part of the community and culture of a particular workplace. They invest in their career, and the company invests in them. A lot of the most interesting jobs, such as software design at my company, are central areas that won't be outsourced. Most companies, including Microsoft, work hard to make it attractive for good employees to stay long-term. Developers join Microsoft because they see the chance to design software or develop technologies that will be used by millions of people. Like many artists, they want their work to reach the largest possible audience.\n\nPeople who want to work for a big company will work for one, and people who don't want to will have interesting alternatives. A Web workstyle also makes it easier for people who have good skills but who can't, or choose not to, work full time. Because they can find more work over the Internet, and do more work from home, those people will have new opportunities. Society will benefit by making better use of this huge pool of talent.\n\nAs a business manager, you need to take a hard look at your basic skills. Look again at the areas of your company that aren't directly involved in that work, and consider whether Web technologies can enable you to outsource those tasks. Let another company take over the management responsibilities for that work and use modern communications technology to work closely with the people - now partners instead of employees-doing the work. Also, consider the employees who have good skills and experience, but decide they don't want to work full time. Better communication tools may allow you to continue using these people. The competition to hire the best people will increase in the years ahead. Companies that give extra freedom to their employees will have the advantage in this key area.\n\nGet to market first\n\nCustomers want high-quality products at low prices, and they want them now. Every business, whether it's a producer of products and services or a supplier to that producer, has to react quickly while keeping quality high and price low. Information technology has become a major contributor to the faster responses, the higher quality, and the lower price rises that have defined business in the last decade.\n\nFew industries illustrate the two main pressures of shrinking time and improving quality better than the car industry. Japanese car designs in the 1980s appeared fresher and their quality improvements more frequent than in American cars because Japanese car makers could take a car from concept to mass production in three years. American car makers typically took four to six years, and their costs were higher.\n\nAmerican companies responded by breaking down the organizational barriers that had divided design, manufacturing, and sales divisions from one another. They also improved communications with their external partners. Designers, engineers, suppliers, and manufacturing personnel began to work in tight teams that communicated electronically, cutting the time from product design to salesroom floor by half.\n\nOther process improvements in the car industry have been significantly helped by technology, including the computer-aided design (CAD) of cars. The 3-D modeling capacities of CAD programs enable engineers to design a vehicle without having to build a model by hand first. The designers can see whether parts will fit together and can change part designs without building special tools. Electronic links between car manufacturers and suppliers have already reduced the error rate in parts delivered by 72 percent, and saved up to eight hours per week per car in labor costs.\n\nCustomers have benefited from better cars, produced more quickly. Ford's achievements in production are representative of the entire car industry. In 1990 the company took five or more years to take a car from concept to customer, and it experienced 150 faults for every 100 cars, or 1,5 faults per car. By 1998 Ford had cut its cycle time by more than half, to less than twenty-four months. Its fault rate had gone down from 150 to 81 faults per 100 cars.\n\nIn some industries the issue is getting to market fast when change is more and more complex. Intel, for example, has always had a ninety-day production cycle for its chips, which power most PCs. Intel expects to maintain this ninety-day production rate, although the processor is getting more and more complex. The number of transistors in the chip increased from 29,000 in the 8086 chip to 7,5 million in the Pentium in 1998, and what the processor is capable of grew by 10,000 in the same twenty years. By 2011 Intel expects to deliver chips that have one billion transistors. Moore's law says that the power of the chips doubles every eighteen to twenty-four months. If cars and cereal went the same way, then by Moore's law a car would cost twenty-seven dollars and a box of cereal would cost a penny.\n\nIntel uses a variety of management, production, and digital methods to maintain efficiency while putting more and more transistors onto a chip the size of a thumbnail. Each time the production process changes, new factories are built that cost more than a billion dollars each.\n\nIn 1998 Intel introduced a \"copy exactly\" strategy to maintain the same level of efficiency and quality across all its chip factories. A program called D2000 made sure that every design engineer got the benefit of best practice across the organization. Intel discovered that more than 60 percent of the problems the designers faced had already been solved by another design team. It's very likely that any large company using manual processes would find a similar amount of repeated work. D2000 has helped Intel to almost double the speed of new product production since 1994, and it has helped Intel toward its goal of volume production from the first design of a chip, without having to go through several versions of a design to get it right.\n\nAlthough banks have always been big users of information technology, they have not had a reputation for fast time to market with new products or services, except for Banco Bradesco, the largest bank in Brazil. With nearly 2,200 branches and twenty million customers, Banco Bradesco has $68,7 billion in assets and serves three million people a day. It was the first Brazilian bank to use computers in 1962, and it was the first bank to offer automated cash machines, in 1982. Banco Bradesco uses technology to stay ahead of the competition. Even six months is too long to bring an idea to the market; the usual development cycle is weeks or, at most, a few months. The bank also aims to bring a new product or service to its entire customer base at the same time.\n\nFor one small-business customer, Bradesco developed software to assist with money going into and out of the business. Now about 4,100 businesses are using this program. For another customer, Bradesco developed a salary card that employees could use in a Bradesco cash machine, even if they did not have an account with the bank. The card is now in use at about 1,300 companies and will soon be in use at 2,000 companies with one million employees. In each case, Bradesco was the first bank to offer the service.\n\nIn 1996, Banco Bradesco became the first bank in Brazil, and only the fifth in the world, to use the Internet to offer banking services. By 1998 the number of online customers was growing at 12 percent per month. Online banking is more popular in Brazil than in any other country. The bank's website, BradescoNet, offers a full range of financial services. By being the first important commercial Internet site in Brazil, the bank has the opportunity to become the site that Brazilians go through to get to other sites. What better way to keep customers loyal to your company?\n\nBut the bank recognizes that it needs to use its digital nervous system even better in the future. The bank wants to collect more information about each customer so that it can sell new financial products targeted at the right people. For example, if a program finds a customer paying car insurance, the bank could offer a loan to buy a new car, even if the customer financed his present car at another bank. Customer data is one of the bank's best assets. It will take Bradesco several years to put together all the information they have, but when they do they can offer many more financial services targeted at the right people.\n\nTime to market has got faster in the PC industry than anywhere else. In this situation a better flow of digital information does not just improve the company, it is essential for the company's success.\n\nIn just a few years the product cycle for Compaq computers dropped from eighteen months to twelve months. By late 1998 it dropped to six to nine months for business products and to four months for consumer products. But with its older information systems, Compaq needed forty-five days to collect its worldwide sales information and reduce it to the single set of numbers needed for product planning. By the time it could communicate its manufacturing needs to its suppliers, the company would be halfway through the four-month product lifecycle for important products.\n\nCompaq started an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. All its factories now use the same software, so all the data that goes into ERP is compatible. The forty-five day planning cycle has now come down to a week. Although a week's sales are necessary to see long-term sales trends, in the future it will have data on sales per day.\n\nCompaq is also using real-time systems which help it to react to unplanned changes in demand. Using the same data that goes into ERP, Compaq wants to look at its supply and order position three times a night, eight hours apart in the United States, Europe, and Asia. With real-time data instead of data that is a week or even a day old, Compaq wants to be able to see and react to, for example, an unplanned order for 7,000 PCs, and work with suppliers to see immediately if the company can deliver the order in time.\n\nTo be able to move as quickly as possible as a company, Compaq has moved all its data systems onto the Internet. An e-commerce system means that when an order comes in, the supplier sees this at the same time as the Compaq planner. But all this has to be done while production is still going on. John White, Chief Information Officer of Compaq in 1998, said it was like changing the wings and engine of a jet while it was still flying.\n\nAnother software decision is: do you get all the ERP software from one company or do you get the best from a lot of different companies? Because compatibility is so important, most companies are going to a single company for all their ERP needs. But Microsoft is interested in making ERP work either across versions or with one set of software. Compaq's solutions are a good example of how technology and business depend on each other, and help each other.\n\nDigital processes make it possible for every company to dramatically shorten its time to market, although some amount of time and energy will always be required to deliver physical goods. MIT's Nicholas Negroponte describes the difference between physical products and information products in the digital age as the difference between moving atoms around (physical products such as cars and computers) and moving bits around (electronic products such as financial analyses and news broadcasts). Producers of bits can use the Internet to reduce their delivery times to almost zero. Producers of atoms still can't do this, but they can use bit-speed-digital organization of all kinds-to bring reaction time down dramatically. Almost all the time involved in producing an item is in the organization of the work, not in the actual production.\n\nGood information systems can remove most of that waiting time. And makers of physical products will find that online service will become as much a part of their \"product\" and customer experience as the physical goods they deliver. The speed of delivery and the interaction with the customer made possible by the Internet effectively shifts products into services. Product companies today need to compare themselves not with the best of their competitors, but with the best of all service companies.\n\nIn the end, the most important speed issue for companies is cultural. It's changing what everybody assumes about how rapidly they must move. Everybody must realize that if you don't satisfy customer demand quickly enough, without lowering quality, a competitor will. When people accept the need for action, digital technology enables a fast response.\n\nChapter three.\n\nManage Knowledge to Improve.\n\nStrategic Thought.\n\nBad news must travel fast.\n\nI have a natural ability to find bad news. If it's out there, I want to know about it. The people who work for me have realized this and keep me informed.\n\nA lot goes wrong in any organization, even a good one. A product fails. You're surprised by a customer who suddenly switches to another company. A competitor brings out a product that appeals to a broad new market. Losing market share is the kind of bad news that every organization can understand. Other bad news may be about what's going on inside the company. Maybe a product is going to be late, or it's not going to do what you expected it to do, or you haven't been able to hire enough of the right kinds of people to carry out your plans. An essential quality of a good manager is the desire to seek bad news rather than deny it. An effective manager wants to hear about what's going wrong before he or she hears about what's going right. You can't react appropriately to disappointing news if it doesn't reach you soon enough.\n\nYou concentrate on bad news in order to get started on the solution quickly. As soon as you're aware of a problem, everybody in your organization must go into action. You can judge a company by how quickly it organizes all of its brain-power to deal with a serious problem. An important measure of a company's digital nervous system is how quickly people in the company find out about bad news and respond to it. Digital technology speeds business response time in any emergency.\n\nIn the old days, every company's response to bad news was slow. Business leaders often learned about problems only after they became serious, since the only quick way to pass information was to interrupt them with a phone call. Before handling a problem, people had to find information in paper files or go down the hall to find somebody who knew something about the situation. When people had some information, they spoke on the phone or sent papers to one another. Every step in the process took a lot of time. Today the dawn of the Information Age means we can send information fast, but even now most companies don't gather the key information about customer issues in one place. By contrast, a well-designed digital nervous system operates as an early-warning system.\n\nThe Internet was not always Microsoft's top priority. Its arrival changed our business and became the biggest surprise we've ever had to respond to. In fact, in 1995 various experts said that the Internet would put Microsoft out of business. This was bad news on a huge scale. We used our digital nervous system to respond to that crisis.\n\nOn August 24, 1995, we introduced Windows 95, the most ambitious software product ever to reach the general customer. This was big news, and hundreds of stories appeared in the months before the release. Windows magazine said, \"This year- for better or worse - Microsoft wins the war\". A Time magazine story said that Microsoft was \"the center of the computer universe\". The introduction of Windows 95 itself was featured on major TV news broadcasts. Within a couple of months, though, the news stories were all taking the opposite view. The Internet had burst into the public's consciousness, and people believed that Microsoft hadn't been invited to the new party. Now stories in the press said we didn't understand the Internet. Smaller, quicker competitors would put Microsoft out of business.\n\nOn December 7, 1995, we held our first Internet Day, where for the first time we publicly displayed the range of technologies we were developing to build Internet support into our products. Within a year of this we had \"Internet-enabled\" our major products and delivered a number of new ones that concentrated on the Internet. Now we lead in several major Internet areas. No one company will dominate the Internet, but Microsoft has come back to play an important role.\n\nHow, our customers and the press often ask me, did we turn the ship around so fast? First, we were never so unaware of the Internet as we might have seemed to outside observers. It wasn't as if somebody said \"Internet\" and we didn't know how to spell it. We had several Internet technologies on our list of things to do. But let's also be clear. In 1993 we were not concentrating on the Internet. It was a fifth or sixth priority. At this time, we didn't have an overall Internet plan for the company. We didn't see that the Internet, a network for scientists and engineers, would grow into the worldwide commercial network it is today. The Internet, had such a limited capacity to carry digital information then that we saw it as a minor stop along the way. The Internet's sudden growth in popularity changed all the rules. People knew the Internet had faults, but it made vast amounts of information available and enabled easy communication. In 1993 alone Internet use doubled to more than twenty-five million people.\n\nThe driving force behind Microsoft's response to the Internet didn't come from me or other senior executives. It came from a small number of enthusiastic employees who saw what was happening. Through our electronic systems they were able to get everybody to join them. Their story is an example of our practice, from day one, that smart people anywhere in the company should have the power to change things. It's an obvious way for Information Age companies to work: all knowledge workers should be part of creating the plan. But we couldn't make it work without the technology we use. For years everybody at Microsoft has had a PC with e-mail. It's a famous part of our company culture, and it's shaped the way we think and act.\n\nWe reached most of the important decisions during this crisis in face-to-face talk. But our decisions were all informed by exchanges taking place over e-mail. Working together electronically cannot replace face-to-face meetings. It's a way to make sure that more work gets done before meetings so that the meetings in person will be more useful. Meeting time is so valuable that you want to be sure you're dealing with facts and good ideas based on solid analysis. You want to be sure that meetings produce plans, that you don't just sit around talking philosophy. E-mail helps turn managers from middlemen into \"doers\". It encourages people to speak up. It encourages managers to listen. That's why, when customers ask what's the first thing they can do to get more value out of their information systems, I always answer, \"e-mail\".\n\nHow fast a company can respond in an emergency is a good measure of how well it responds to events. People in the organization will feel threatened by bad news, but that's OK if they feel it as a group. As a leader, I created a sense of crisis about the Internet in 1994 and 1995. Not to leave people unhappy or unable to work, but to excite them to action. The leader needs to create an environment in which people can analyze the situation and develop a good response.\n\nI like good news as much as the next person, but it also makes me suspicious. I wonder what bad news I'm not hearing. When somebody sends me an e-mail about an account we've won, I always think, \"There are a lot of accounts nobody has sent mail about. Does that mean we've lost all of those\"?\n\nThis reaction may seem unnecessary, but I've found there's a psychological need in people to send good news when bad news is coming. It's as if they want to lessen the shock. A good e-mail system makes sure that bad news can travel fast, but your people have to be willing to send you the news. You must always be open to bad news, and then you have to act on it. Sometimes I think my most important job as a boss is to listen for bad news. If you don't act on it, your people will eventually stop bringing bad news to your attention. And that's the beginning of the end.\n\nIn three years every product my company makes will be out of date. The only question is whether we will replace them or someone else will. In the next ten years, if Microsoft remains a leader, we'll have to cope with at least three major crises. That's why we've always got to do better. I insist that we keep up with events, as well as pursue longer-term projects, and that we use \"bad news\" to drive us to put new features into our products. One day, somebody will catch us asleep. One day, a new firm will put Microsoft out of business. I just hope it's fifty years from now, not two or five.\n\nChange bad news to good.\n\nIf you treat unpleasant news not as a negative, but as evidence of a need for change, you aren't defeated by it. You're learning from it. Learning from failures and constantly improving products is a key to success in all companies. Listening to customers is a big part of that effort. You have to study what customers say about their problems with your products and be constantly aware of what they want.\n\nBut it is surprisingly hard to get bad news from customers passed all the way to the product design groups. Most companies don't have an efficient chain of people and paper between customers and the people who can make major improvements. When the customer data finally reaches the product design group, it often isn't easy for the team to give it the right priority. All of the delays mean that improvements don't happen as fast as they should.\n\nI recommend the following approach to bringing customer complaints and wish lists into the process of product and service development:\n\n1. Concentrate on your most unhappy customers.\n\n2. Use technology to gather rich information on their unhappy experiences with your product and to find out what they want you to put into the product.\n\n3. Use technology to pass the news to the right people in a hurry.\n\nIf you do these three things, you'll turn those bad news experiences into an exciting process of improving your product or service. Unhappy customers are always a concern. They're also your greatest opportunity. Listening and learning rather than being defensive can make customer complaints your best source of significant quality improvements. Adopting the right technology will give you the power to capture and change complaints into better products and services fast.\n\nFor example, any employee of Promus Hotels, based in Memphis, Tennessee, can give customers their money back if they are not satisfied. A no-questions-asked money-back guarantee from a service company like Promus means something. The company has a good reason to fix the problem right away. And because every employee can act on the guarantee, employees watch for quality. So how does Promus stop customers using the guarantee for a free stay and complaining when nothing was really wrong? Technology. All complaints are dealt with by the same main computer. It can quickly identify anyone who goes from hotel to hotel claiming poor service and getting money back. Promus then sends a nice letter, regretting that the hotels could not meet the customer's standards and inviting him to stay in a competitor's hotels.\n\nIf your customers can contact you electronically with their problems, you need to be prepared to answer quickly. When a customer mails a letter to a company, he or she doesn't expect a reply for a week, but the customer knows that the e-mail arrives in a few minutes, if not seconds. It's usual for businesses to respond to e-mail within a few hours or overnight. A few days is \"slow\". If you take weeks to reply, customers will take their business elsewhere. Because e-mail is so much easier to send than paper mail, you're likely to get many more responses, too. So when you ask for electronic responses, make sure you have the staff and the internal systems in place to handle them quickly.\n\nListen to your customers and take their bad news as an opportunity to turn your failures into the improvements they want. Companies that invest early in digital nervous systems to capture, analyze, and build on customer opinion will stand out from the competition. You should examine customer complaints more often than company finances. And your digital systems should help you change bad news into improved products and services.\n\nKnow your numbers.\n\nJiffy Lube was the world's number one servicer of cars, but it was unprofitable when the Pennzoil Company bought it in 1991. By 1997 Jiffy Lube earned $25 million, the highest earnings in its history and an increase of 14 percent over 1996 earnings. Jiffy Lube serviced 21 million cars, an increase of 1,2 million over 1996. Driving this new success was a daily flow of information from each store to headquarters and back. Customer service information from all 1,600 Jiffy Lube outlets is sent to headquarters at Houston every night. Headquarters does immediate analysis on the figures. Beginning as early as 5 AM, up-to-date data is available to each Jiffy Lube outlet. For example, if people in one neighborhood are not using their Jiffy Lube outlet as much as expected the manager of that outlet will know about it.\n\n\"Know your numbers\" is a basic business principle. You need to gather your business' data at every step of the way and in every interaction with your customers - and with your partners, too. Then you need to understand what the data means. The numbers shouldn't be your only concern but you should objectively understand everything possible about your business. If you're considering exchanging short-term profits for long-term gains, for example, you need to know as closely as possible the cost of that trade. Companies can use the data they collect to improve the efficiency of their businesses, strengthen their relationships with both customers and partners, extend their businesses in new ways, and develop better service and new products.\n\nThere are two ways to use customer data. The first is to gather the numbers that show trends and patterns on which to base analysis, planning, and decisions. The second is to collect detailed information on the individual customer so that you can provide personal service. By creating a digital flow of information from start to finish, businesses are able to create tight links between knowledge management, commerce, and business operations. At Microsoft we showed big improvements as soon as we started using MOET (Microsoft Order Entry Tool) to take customer orders, and MOET is now an advanced website for electronic commerce worldwide.\n\nTo use information well, you need to capture it digitally from the start and analyze it in digital form at every stage of your business processes. \"Every stage\" includes not just what happens within your company walls, but also what happens with both your customers and your suppliers. Knowing your numbers can produce big changes in all of your business relationships and give you a significant competitive advantage.\n\nThe business side of any company starts and ends with deep analysis of its numbers. Whatever else you do, if you don't understand what's happening in your business factually, and you're making decisions based on soft data or emotion, you'll eventually pay a big price. Numbers give you the factual basis for the directions in which you take your products. They tell you objectively what customers like and don't like. They help you identify your highest priorities so that you can take fast action. Nothing else can take the place of understanding your numbers at a working level. Sometimes my friend Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's president, surprises the members of a product group by knowing their pricing structures and sales numbers - and the competitors' - better than the people presenting a plan to him. He has a way of marching into a room and immediately asking the one question the team doesn't have an answer to. He's done the work, and he's thought hard about the issues that come out of the numbers. He sets a high priority on decisions that are based on facts.\n\nThe middle managers at a company are the people who should be analyzing the numbers. Other groups can help, but the people who deal with customers and competitive problems need to look at their business in every way possible every day. The analysis should support action and not just more analysis. Analysis should lead you step by step to a decision and to action. You have to think, act, judge, adapt.\n\nStarting with digital numbers doesn't just prevent unnecessary effort and errors. It also sets in motion the best ways to process the data afterward. Being digital from the start drives efficiency in manufacturing, shipping, billing, and other operational processes. Getting the data digitally is also the only way to make sure that you get information quickly enough to respond to customer needs before your competitor does.\n\nThis need for good information to drive employees to quick action is one reason that \"paper numbers\" bother me as much as paper forms do. A printed sales figure or a printed number on customer trends is fixed. You don't have the ability to get in and analyze the detail behind the number, or to e-mail it to somebody to talk about it. With a paper number that looks wrong, you have to get hold of somebody and say, \"I'm looking at this report, and this number surprises me\". A lot of the time there's an easy explanation: a customer has put in a big order or has canceled one. There's nothing you need to do, but you still want to know quickly why the month's results look strange. If you notice a trend in a paper report, it's hard to send the paper around and get people to analyze it. Over time you stop paying attention because it's so hard to investigate. When figures are in digital form, knowledge workers can study them, attach notes to them, look at them in any amount of detail or in any view they want, and pass them around to get help. A number in digital form is the start of thought and action.\n\nDigital technology also enables a company to create a network of partners that serves its customers better. You can create a virtual company in which everyone is joined together by commerce, knowledge management, and operational systems. Your partners are better connected to you, benefit more from your success, and naturally respond to the same patterns of customer behavior that you do.\n\nWhen your information systems are designed to create a flow of information to and from your customers, the business processes of the entire supply system will become more efficient. Just-in-time delivery can be a reality for any industry.\n\nDigital information flow makes it possible to create an organization without limits, but it takes a new company culture to turn suppliers from \"them\" into \"us\". Traditionally companies have not thought of suppliers as a true part of the overall business process needed to serve customers. Today's approach is that of a \"value network,\" a network of partners enabled by digital information flow. Everyone who touches the product must add value, and communications go forward as well as back. Companies in the value network aren't restricted by heavy chains of process, but can interact and do business with many different sellers as they need to.\n\nIf the benefits of knowing your numbers and creating a value network are so persuasive, why don't more companies do it? Why don't more companies create a digital information flow to observe trends? Why don't they follow customer history? The main reason is that too few companies start with digital information. Existing paper systems cause people to assume that data is hard to get and work with. They have to work with piles of papers that they can't organize or analyze. They can't find patterns in their data. They can't turn their paper information into action. Because so few companies are using digital tools internally or with partners today, those firms that act quickly to create a digital nervous system have the opportunity to jump ahead of their competitors.\n\nTo make the change to a more efficient virtual company, you need to look first at all of the paper on the desks of knowledge workers and ask: How could digital systems get rid of these piles of papers? As part of this inquiry, think of your business processes as extending far beyond your walls to include the entire network of your partners and customers. You need to develop business processes supported by a fast, reliable flow of information that will enable the customer to drive your responses and the responses of all your sellers as if you were a single unit.\n\nMove people into thinking work.\n\nThe inevitable result of better computer systems is a smarter use of people's time. With intelligent software continuously searching through its sales data, following trends, and noticing what's selling and what's not, the British chain store Marks & Spencer can use its 500 to 600 buyers much more efficiently.\n\nInstead of working through fat paper reports from the previous day to try to find out whether sales are going well, the buyers can use their time more efficiently, using what the latest data is telling them. If sales are going well, no human action is needed, but the system checks sales data and notices any items whose sales are higher or lower than expected. Reports on these items are created automatically and they are all that buyers must deal with.\n\nUsing software to handle routine data tasks gives you the opportunity to provide the human touch where it really matters. There's a dramatic difference between getting a note that was clearly written by a person rather than a computer. It's enormously valuable to have a person working with any customer who is unhappy about something really important, or who has special needs. In a hotel, for instance, smart software can dramatically shorten the check-in and check-out time. Staff can then help customers rather than filling in forms, and guests will enjoy their stays more as a result.\n\nElectronic commerce, though, brings new challenges. In a physical store a sales person can use clues such as the customer's questions, dress style, and body language to assess his or her interests. However, at a Web store no one sees the customer, and the goal is to let the customer do as much shopping as possible for himself or herself. Web store owners then have some interesting information to find out. Based on customer behavior, how do you construct a model of who the shopper is? It requires smart data analysis.\n\nDigital tools for analysis are changing the nature of work. Knowledge workers can concentrate on unusual events rather than on the routine. Of course, people don't like allowing machines to take their decisions for them. But when a database gets big enough and complex enough, the computer can do the initial searching and sorting far better than a human being. We're simply not able to recognize patterns in large amounts of data. And the available data - in databases, file systems, message systems, and websites - is growing all the time. The only way we can get the full value of all this data is to use computer tools to find the useful information.\n\nHarperCollins, the publishing company, uses a PC-based system to follow book sales so that it can print just enough books to meet demand. That way it won't be caught with large stocks of unsold books in stores, which publishers have to take back. After only a year in operation the new system has helped HarperCollins reduce returns of unsold copies of its most popular books from over 30 percent to about 10 percent. Each percentage point represents millions of dollars in savings.\n\nUsing software to find useful patterns in large amounts of data is called data mining. It can help to predict whether customers are likely to buy an item because of their age, sex, hometown, and other characteristics. It can also identify customers with similar shopping behavior, and customers with specific tastes, in order to provide improved individual service. An Australian health-care company used data mining to follow buying patterns and discovered a $10 million fraud.\n\nThe most common use of data mining is for database marketing, in which companies analyze data to discover customer tastes and then make offers to specific sets of people. For example, American Airlines uses information about the twenty-six million members of its frequent flier program - such as the car rental companies, hotels, and restaurants they use - to develop targeted marketing efforts that have saved more than $100 million in costs.\n\nData mining is part of customer relationship management (CRM), in which information technology helps companies manage customer relationships individually instead of all together. With the patterns revealed by data mining, you can present your products to a customer in a way that's most likely to increase your value to the customer, and his or her value to you. Cost savings come from having more exact models of customers and so the amount of mailings is reduced. A direct marketing campaign for something like credit cards, for example, would normally get a return of about 2 percent. Mellon Bank USA in 1997 had a target of 200,000 new customers, which would normally mean a mailing to 10 million people. Instead, the bank used data mining to produce models of the most likely new customers. The bank was then able to meet its target of 200,000 new customers with a mailing of 2 million, not 10 million. In addition to reducing costs, each new customer was three times more profitable than usual because data mining had targeted the customers whose needs best matched Mellon Bank's services.\n\nThis personalization will deeply affect all forms of advertising. As digital TV becomes more popular and electronic books become the preferred way to read magazines and newspapers, almost all advertising will move away from mass advertising to personalized advertising. The commercials that appear on screen will differ according to who is looking at them; different neighborhoods or even different homes in the same area could see different commercials. Big companies can become more efficient with their advertising, and small companies can consider TV and magazine advertisements for the first time. Today many types of advertisement are too expensive for any except true mass-market products. Soon even the neighborhood grocer might be able to afford commercials for people living near the store.\n\nTargeted advertisements should make customers happy. They're more likely to see advertisements that are relevant to them. Some people may be worried that advertisers have too much information about them, but software will make it possible for people to reveal only the information they want to reveal. For example, most people wouldn't mind if advertisers were given viewing patterns. Most regular readers of specialized magazines - whether the topic is sports, food, science, gardening, or cars - look at the advertisements as carefully as the articles. If you watch TV in the same way, mainly for one or two interests, you probably wouldn't object to seeing commercials that concentrate on those interests.\n\nToday most data mining systems are quite expensive, ranging from $25,000 to $150,000 for a small or medium-size business to millions of dollars for a big customer like Wal-Mart. One insurance company spent $10 million for a data mining system five years ago. The boss said he knew he could get the same results for a lot less money with today's technology, but the benefits had been worth the investment.\n\nThat remark indicates the value of data mining, but these high prices reflect the old days of complex software, in which only the largest organizations, using a lot of staff or hiring specialists, could make good use of data. With the growth of competition in our information-based economy, customer data has become an increasingly important asset. Every company and everyknowledge worker must try to get the most out of the company's data assets. These new users can't afford big database budgets or specialized database experts.\n\nFortunately, as data mining systems become available for PCs, you'll see prices drop dramatically and the use of data mining explode in companies and departments of all sizes. Soon every company will be able to do the kind of analysis that used to be reserved for the richest organizations.\n\nThe greatest value of data mining will be to help companies decide the right products to build and the right way to price them. Companies will be able to look at a variety of packaging options and prices to see which are most attractive to customers and profitable to themselves. These possibilities are of special interest to companies that sell information products. Unlike a car or a chair, products such as insurance, financial services, and books cost much more to develop than to produce and have a value fixed more by the customer than by the physical cost of goods. The secret of success with information products is understanding the characteristics and buying habits of your most likely customers.\n\nThe power of data mining will help companies to work out how to acquire new customers, whom to market to, how to price their products, and how to attract individual customers. Human creativity and skill are needed to use this information to create new packaging and pricing ideas, to see new products in the patterns of the computer results, and to develop exciting new offers. The better the tool, the more creative they can be.\n\nManagers need to invest in advanced tools that help people work. You should budget 3 to 4 percent of the salary of your knowledge workers to make sure they have the best tools, which free people to use their energy for creative responses to the patterns and trends identified by the computer. Using information to develop new products and services, and to work together more closely with partners and customers, will always remain a uniquely human task.\n\nRaise your corporate IQ.\n\nLike reengineering before it, \"knowledge management\" has been given so many meanings that it sometimes seems to mean whatever someone wants it to mean. News articles on the topic appear regularly. Consulting companies and websites specialize in knowledge management, and a \"knowledge management\" magazine started in 1998. If reporters talk to a database company, they find that knowledge management is the newest thing in databases. If reporters talk to a network company, they find that knowledge management means the future of networking. But as a general concept - to gather and organize information, pass the information on to the people who need it, and constantly improve the information through analysis and teamwork - knowledge management is useful.\n\nSo let's be clear on a couple of things first. Knowledge management, as I use the phrase here, is not a software product or a software category. Knowledge management doesn't even start with technology. It starts with business goals and processes and an understanding of the need to share information. Knowledge management is nothing more than managing information flow, getting the right information to the people who need it so that they can act on it quickly. And knowledge management is a means, not an end.\n\nThe aim is to increase corporate IQ. In today's fast-moving markets, a company needs high corporate IQ to succeed. By corporate IQ I don't just mean having a lot of smart people at your company - though it helps to start with smart people.\n\nCorporate IQ is a measure of how easily your company can share information broadly and of how well people within your organization can build on each other's ideas. Corporate IQ involves sharing both history and current knowledge. The workers in a company with a high corporate IQ work together efficiently so that all of the key people on a project are well-informed and full of energy. The final goal is to have a team develop the best ideas from throughout an organization, and then act with the same purpose and concentration that a single, enthusiastic person would bring to a situation. Digital information flow can help groups to function like individuals.\n\nA company's high-level executives need to believe in knowledge sharing, or even a major effort in sharing will fail. Leaders must also show that they themselves are not locked away in a palace, isolated from everyone else, but are willing to engage with employees. Jacques (Jac) Nasser, operations president at Ford, sends an e-mail every Friday afternoon to 89,000 Ford employees all around the world, sharing the week's news - the good and the bad - with everybody. No one checks the e-mail. He talks straight to the employees. He also reads the hundreds of responses he gets each month and assigns a member of his team to reply to any that need an answer.\n\nI don't send out weekly reports, but I do e-mail employees around the world on major topics. Like Jac Nasser, I read all the e-mail that employees send me, and I pass items on to people for action. I find the e-mail that people send me an amazingly good way to stay aware of the attitudes and issues affecting the many people who work at Microsoft.\n\nWhen business leaders have created an atmosphere that encourages teamwork and knowledge sharing, they need to set up specific knowledge-sharing projects across the organization and make knowledge sharing a key part of the work itself - not an extra that can safely be ignored. Then leaders need to make sure that the people who share knowledge are rewarded. The old saying \"Knowledge is power\" sometimes makes people keep knowledge to themselves. They believe that this makes them more valuable to the company. Power comes not from knowledge kept, but from knowledge shared. A company's values and reward system should reflect that idea.\n\nKnowledge management can help any business in four major areas: planning, customer service, training, and teamwork on projects. If you haven't done any work on knowledge management in your company yet, consider picking one or two areas in which to begin knowledge management projects. You can use the success of your projects in those areas to encourage knowledge management projects in your other business areas. Within a few years all leading companies will have achieved high levels of digitally aided knowledge sharing.\n\nKnowledge sharing can help brand planning across countries. Coca-Cola set up worldwide communication with its own e-mail system in the 1980s but it saw IT as an expense to be controlled rather than a tool to help better business. When this changed, all systems and functions were made compatible worldwide and the biggest user of technology was marketing, not finance. The marketing tool Inform (Information for Marketing) looks at data about consumer preferences in every country. From sales data, it can tell you what types of people in a small town in South Africa drink Sprite every day and how much they drank last March.\n\nKnowledge management can be used to make response to customers faster. Yamanouchi Pharmaceuticals, at $3,9 billion, is the third largest drugs company in Japan. They and Microsoft have made Web-based information systems an important part of improving quality and speed of answers to customers' technical questions. Product support at Yamanouchi can immediately answer about half the questions that come in from doctors. To find answers to more difficult questions they use Yamanouchi's Web-based PRoduct INformation CEnter Supporting System or PRINCESS. This uses electronic searches by product and by word. Answers are put into the system for use next time. In 1998, PRINCESS was made available to the sales team. The next step could be to make it available to doctors themselves.\n\nOnline training is another area where knowledge management can make things faster and better. US Web trains people to use technology in business. It has developed SiteCast for interactive seminars. Online training has been really popular at Microsoft. In 1998 twice as many people were training online as in class.\n\nDigital information flow can help in product development, too. Nabisco has some of the most popular foods in the world. About a third of its new products are worldwide successes, a third do OK, and another third underperform. These results are better than average, but with competition increasing Nabisco decided to use information technology more in the product development process. Nabisco didn't need a new product development process. The technology was needed to help the product development team communicate with each other better and faster. A system called Journey now organizes the information that used to be anywhere on any desk in the office. All of the people involved in the development of any new product need only to click on the product to find all the information about it. For example, Nabisco developed a new product and something in the product was changed. The people writing the description of the product on the label saw the change online and changed the label immediately.\n\nKnowledge management is a fancy term for a simple idea. You're managing data, documents, and people's efforts. Your aim should be to improve the way people work together, share ideas, sometimes argue, and build on one another's ideas-and then act together for a common purpose. The boss's role in raising a company's corporate IQ is to create an atmosphere that promotes knowledge sharing and teamwork, to make a priority of those areas in which knowledge sharing is most valuable, to provide the digital tools that make knowledge sharing possible, and to reward people for contributing to a full flow of information.\n\nBig wins require big risks.\n\nTo be a market leader, you have to have big goals. You can't just look at the past or the current state of the market. You also have to look at where it's likely to go, and where it might go under certain circumstances, and then direct your company according to your best predictions. To win big, sometimes you have to take big risks. Big bets mean big failures as well as successes. Today, looking back, it's easy to believe that Microsoft's current success was inevitable. But at the time we made our big bets - including starting the company as the first personal computer software firm - most people thought we would fail.\n\nMany leading companies hesitated to move to new technologies for fear of ruining the success of their existing technologies. They learned a hard lesson. If you don't take risks early, you'll decline in the market later. If you bet big, though, only a few of these risks have to succeed to provide for your future. Microsoft's current goals include improving the PC's performance beyond all existing systems, developing computers that \"see, listen, and learn,\" and creating software to power the new personal companion computers. These plans are Microsoft's response to the future, in which all machines will use digital technology and need to work with one another. Whether or not these plans succeed, one fact is clear: we have to take these risks in order to have a long-term future.\n\nRisk taking is natural in a new industry. The computer industry is about as far into its development as cars were in the 1910s and planes were in the 1930s. Those industries went through revolutionary, and often messy, technical and business change before they became stable, and the same thing is happening in the computer industry.\n\nDevelop processes that give people power.\n\nA business has processes that are similar to the basic biological processes that keep us alive. One of these processes is the function that defines the company's reason for existing - its manufacturing process, for example. This function has to be as efficient and reliable as the beating of a heart.\n\nA second kind of automatic process in business is administrative - the process of receiving payments, paying bills and salaries, for example. The administrative processes are as essential to a business as breathing. If the basic operational processes of your business fail, your company fails.\n\nBecause the basic operational processes are so important - and so expensive - most big companies began to invest heavily in automating them years ago. But too often the automated processes were isolated from one another. Overall efficiency wasn't nearly as good as it could be. Until recently, for example, in the manufacture of some aircraft parts only 10 percent of the original metal was actually used in an aircraft. The manufacturing process had been improved at many individual stages along the way rather than as a whole. There was an enormous amount of waste.\n\nI have talked about business operations such as financial and other administrative systems in other sections. In this section I concentrate on production processes. An automated production process is necessary, but not enough on its own to make a company competitive today. A good digital nervous system can help you develop your employees into knowledge workers, changing your company's basic production processes into a competitive advantage.\n\nFirst, you need to use information technology to understand the inner workings of the process itself better in order to make it both more efficient and more responsive to changing circumstances. Entergy Corporation of New Orleans has increased the efficiency of its power plants with a new process-control system. This allows plant operators to adjust plant efficiency and analyze performance trends as they occur. Operators can actually look inside the plant systems in order to understand exactly how the machines are functioning and to work out whether a minor change or a repair might save an expensive repair later.\n\nAn intelligent PC-based system makes sure that the highest-priority items are repaired first. The process-control system actually shows operators the cost of reduced efficiency if the temperature is ten degrees lower than it should be, for example. By attaching a dollar figure to operational decisions, Entergy is turning its operators into business people, giving them the information they need to run their units efficiently, and making them a lot more responsible for their decisions. And because production costs for Entergy's plants are available to senior staff electronically on a minute-by-minute basis, the company can improve its profits by moving power production constantly to those units that are delivering the most cost-efficient energy.\n\nThen you need to be able to get data from your production process to inform other business systems. The Stepan Company, which produces cleaning chemicals, has developed a process-control system that has raised the plant's output by 300 percent and saved the company millions of dollars through more efficient use of its equipment. But the efficiency gains are not as valuable to Stepan as the way that its process-control system can deal with changing customer demands.\n\nFinally, and most important, you need to feed the data from your production process to your production workers so that they can improve the quality of the product itself. If you provide the right technology to help production workers do fast analysis, they'll turn data into information that will help you improve design and reduce faults. Developing a digital nervous system allows you to give more power to as many of your workers as possible.\n\nIn the new organization the worker is no longer a part of a machine but is an intelligent part of the overall process. Some metal workers now have to know mathematics to work out angles from computerized designs. Water-treatment companies train production-line workers how to do computerized measurement and math. New digital copiers require the service personnel to have an understanding of computers and the Internet, not just skill with a screwdriver.\n\nHuman beings remain essential in operational processes that have to constantly improve and adapt to changing circumstances. An efficient production line needs people-well-informed, responsible people. As we organize tasks into processes, we give workers more responsibility. Computers will take over some jobs, but they will mean that many other jobs are no longer boring.\n\nWhen people can concentrate on whole processes, their work is more interesting and challenging. Simple tasks will disappear, or be automated or built into a bigger process. Work that involves repeating the same task over and over again is exactly what computers and other machines are best at - and what human workers are poorly suited to and almost always hate. Managing a process instead of performing a task makes someone a knowledge worker, and good digital information flow enables knowledge workers to play their unique roles.\n\nMost companies have been willing to give information tools to their high-paid office staff whose job is information work. Entergy and Stepan are proving that building systems around information flow and giving information tools to line workers can also provide enormous value. Entergy is changing all of its key business processes and pushing information and decision-making down to the operational level. Stepan is using information to manage its plants as a whole to adapt to changing customer needs. Both of these companies are applying knowledge management to business operations to analyze and improve production, quality, and failure rates. Digital tools bring more intelligence to their business operations.\n\nGive your workers better jobs with better tools, and you'll discover that your employees will become more responsible and bring more intelligence to their work. In the digital age you need to make knowledge workers out of every employee that you can.\n\nChapter four.\n\nSpecial Projects.\n\nNo health-care system is an island.\n\nA few years ago, a new Microsoft employee was called back to his home state because his mother had suffered a mild stroke. When she was well enough to leave the hospital, Mrs Jones (not her real name) stayed with her sister while her son completed plans to move her near him. Mrs Jones largely recovered but was never able to live on her own again, and her periods of good health were interrupted by hospital stays to treat more and more serious problems.\n\nThe medical events of the last two years of Mrs Jones's life show the best and the worst of the American health-care system. She received good care, including a number of very new treatments, from three different hospitals and more than a dozen doctors in two different states. As her physical abilities declined, her middle-class family was able to find good facilities providing greater degrees of care. Medicare and her own private insurance paid most of the bills; she and her family paid the rest. Her many doctors, nurses, and other care givers were professional and kind.\n\nBut the system was far from perfect. When Mrs Jones left the first hospital for her sister's hometown fifty kilometers away, a communication failure between doctors meant that her medicine was kept at full strength when Mrs Jones should have been on a declining dose. By the time she arrived in the North West, side effects of the high dose meant that she had to go into hospital immediately. Because her records didn't come with her, a number of expensive tests had to be repeated.\n\nThe same thing happened when she changed hospitals a year later. Her final three-week hospital stay, which did not involve any surgery, still cost $25,000. At one point, a doctor confused her with another patient and told her next doctor that her recent hospital stays were \"an abuse of the system\". This was less than a week before Mrs Jones died.\n\nThese and other problems went on even though Mrs Jones had her family to help her work through the confusing medical and social services options. Her son and daughter-in-law took turns spending many hours standing in line at one agency or on the phone with another. And it took a year before they could persuade one hospital to stop billing them for services that had been paid for in full.\n\nBecause of the many hospitals, doctors, care facilities, and public and private agencies involved, the amount of paperwork was enormous. Consider the number of people this paperwork represented. For every doctor and nurse who treated Mrs Jones, there must have been a dozen billing people in several different organizations. It was like an old-fashioned military operation. For every soldier in the field, you had twenty people behind the lines handling administration.\n\nMost experts estimate that 20 to 30 percent of the annual trillion-dollar cost of the US health-care system is spent on paperwork. In hospitals that number could be as high as 40 to 40 percent. A single week's stay can create as many as a hundred pieces of paper. And, making things worse, about 13 percent of the one to two billion claims each year in the United States are returned for errors.\n\nPaperwork and complexity have risen even as the US health-care industry has shifted to \"managed care\" in an effort to reduce costs, prevent fraud, and provide appropriate care. With managed care, an organization will contract with a group of doctors to provide medical services toward managed results, and for fixed fees. More than 160 million people in the United States were in managed-care plans at the beginning of 1997, the last year for which figures are available.\n\nDoctors understand the need to control costs but feel buried in rules and layers of management. They're afraid that their medical options may be limited and that the care of patients may suffer. They have also made the situation more complicated by treating patient files as business records and often hesitating to share them with competing doctors. And they've largely been opposed to computers, although that's mainly because early medical systems were clumsy and expensive. Oddly, the managed care that many doctors love to hate may become the primary force that extends information systems into patient care and returns control of patient care to doctors. When you put enough clinically helpful information in front of doctors, they see the benefits and ask for more.\n\nPatients, meanwhile, are recognizing how much more information is available to them on the Web and how this information gives them a sense of control and responsibility in maintaining their own health.\n\nClinical benefits have also encouraged health-care bosses to push for better information systems. Until now, health care has applied only 2 to 3 percent of its earnings to information technology, compared with the banking industry's 15 percent. Although health care is a high-technology field, the technology has been applied to individual treatment systems, not to information flow. Often the information software that is used is not designed to work with other information software, despite all the health-care areas that should share data: the laboratory, the blood bank, charting, billing systems, and the machines that watch over patients.\n\nOrganizations have had to build special interfaces between the different software programs. A typical health-care organization can have hundreds of these interfaces. One organization currently manages 1,800 different interfaces. This complexity is one reason it has typically taken two years for a health-care organization to buy a new system and another two years to install it - too slow by any standard.\n\nToday the situation is more encouraging. The US government has passed laws that require a standard to be defined for electronic finance and administrative dealings, including computer-based patient records. Better information handling in medical organizations will be a requirement in the future. Some health organizations, recognizing that their patients' needs can't wait, are showing strong leadership. They're proving that a digital nervous system can be enormously valuable in all areas of patient care: from emergency services through hospital treatment, keeping in touch with patients, and long-term trend analysis.\n\nImagine you had a health-care system in your local community built from digital parts. An intelligent emergency system gets you to the hospital quickly, and all the important information on your medical history and current medical condition feeds immediately into the hospital's computers. A doctor uses a touch screen, keyboard, or pen to order your treatment. Digital instructions are sent off to the laboratories. Computers supply laboratory results electronically. These and other reports are online for easy review by any doctor, on site or off. The system will tell doctors about any possible problems with the treatment or differences from the approved clinical path. Billing is handled automatically. Systems that process computer deals uncover fraud or unusual use.\n\nInstead of spending half their time on paperwork, doctors and nurses spend almost all their time treating you and their other patients. Test results and bills reach you in simple, understandable language. All the information about your treatment and medicine is assessed automatically over the longer term to help prevent problems.\n\nYour care after hospital is also scheduled automatically. You find medical information on the Internet and so your meetings with health workers are more informed, whether you communicate with them over the Internet, by e-mail, or you meet in person. You use e-mail to ask routine questions of your doctor and to be reminded about continuing health programs.\n\nWhen you change health plans, all your medical history goes with you instead of being lost or following after you several months later. Doctors use your history to identify trends in blood pressure, weight, and other patterns that might reveal a serious developing problem. Systematic medical analysis of the whole community makes the authorities aware of any worrying public health trends much sooner and more accurately than has been possible before.\n\nIf health-care communities take an approach based on PC and Web technologies, abilities like these do not have to cost a fortune. PCs enable a step-by-step approach using standardized software. PCs are also now being used to control specialized machines such as blood and tissue analyzers, reducing their costs and enabling their data to be shared.\n\nPCs are powerful enough to handle hundreds of thousands of claims or inquiries per hour. All together, the technologies described in this chapter would cost less than $5 million for a typical health-care organization. This is not a small amount of money, but it is minor compared with the amount most health organizations spend on paper-based work and stand-alone computer systems today. With paperwork making up 20 to 30 percent of the $1 trillion-plus per year earnings of the US health-care system, the current cost is $200 billion to $300 billion annually - more than the entire earnings of many countries.\n\nToday the lack of information systems in doctors' offices is the biggest barrier to improving patient care. Only about 5 percent of offices in the United States use computer systems in their clinical work. Computerizing a doctor's office will cost from $10,000 to $50,000 for each one, but doctors can quickly recover the costs. A five-doctor office in Hammond, Louisiana, invested about $50,000 in PC patient systems that made it easy for doctors to enter data; the office saved $60,000 the first year in typing costs alone.\n\nIt will take a big effort from health-care providers to improve health care through digital information. The technology is available today. An investment in a shared infrastructure and tools will enable not just a huge reduction in costs, but better health treatment for everyone. Change will be driven by two groups: patients who insist on being better informed and more involved in their own health, and health professionals who use these new tools to provide better care. Together they'll use a digital nervous system to turn the islands of health care into a single continent.\n\nTake government to the people.\n\nGovernment, maybe more than any other organization, can benefit from the efficiency and improved service that flow from digital processes. Developed nations will lead the way in creating paperless processes to reduce administration. Developing nations will be able to provide new services without ever having to deal with clumsy paper methods.\n\nBut most governments are far behind business in using the tools of the digital age. Businesses going digital are stuck with many paper forms because governments are not yet online. The reason for this delay is a lack of organizational purpose. Because government processes use a lot of paper and people, in the past making them more \"efficient\" often meant a reduction in service. It's common for governments to forbid agencies to close any offices, which simply forces them to struggle to do more with less.\n\nAt the same time, there are few pressures to provide better service. Citizens can't take their business to another tax agency or vehicle-license office. Government agencies tend to concentrate on their own internal organizational needs rather than the broad needs of citizens and businesses. As an example, consider the paperwork involved in hiring a child-care provider in the United States. The employer has to know that there are five agencies involved, each with its own set of forms. This complication, rather than a desire to avoid paying the taxes, explains why so few people follow the rules. In this and many other cases, to the average citizen government remains a threatening knot of separate agencies and rules.\n\nBut digital processes and the Web lifestyle give government the opportunity to change so that it is organized around citizens rather than administration. Governments can take five major steps to help make the digital age a reality in their countries. The first two involve improving government services; the last three involve creating an infrastructure so that a country's businesses can compete in the digital age:\n\n1 Put government employees on e-mail and get rid of paper filing. Make sure that all information inside government is digital.\n\n2 Put government services online with an interface designed for the user. Publish everything on the Internet.\n\n3 Attract investment by technology companies and encourage electronic commerce, sometimes with financial help, but more often with joint projects. Create a standard for the electronic identification of businesses and citizens.\n\n4 Remove the rules that stop the communications industry from working efficiently. Encourage major investments in the communications infrastructure.\n\n5 Improve the skills of citizens by using technology as part of education and training systems at all levels.\n\nGovernment, like businesses, can make better use of software tools and e-mail to get far more benefits from technology investments. In developed nations many government employees and public officials already have PCs on their desks, and developing nations can put in a PC infrastructure for a small cost. The use of e-mail alone promotes cooperation between agencies and enables public officials to respond better to inquiries. Some US politicians are beginning to use e-mail to stay in touch with citizens, and Australia's national parliament is using digital work flow to make sure that inquiries are followed up.\n\nGovernments need to make the decision to use digital information flow instead of paper. Internet publishing should be standard. Printed documents should be rare. The savings would be immense. The US government alone spends one billion dollars annually printing documents that are already available on the Web. Most copies of these documents are for public officials whose offices are already online. Most of the printed copies end up in the trash in the nation's capital. Web publishing of all government documents can reduce costs and make information far easier to find. Digital systems are also better for complex documents. The government description of a transport plane, which companies need if they want to bid to build it, weighs more than a house in printed form, but the data would easily fit on a couple of CDs.\n\nAn online approach does more than simply reduce paper expenses. Web technology makes it possible for governments to provide a single point of contact for the public, a single online \"face\" to structure information according to what is important to the citizen.\n\nIn several Swedish cities, for example, webpages organize a variety of services from various levels of government. Citizens can quickly find passport offices, tax authorities, and national insurance offices. They can get reports from public meetings and other public documents. They can even get real-time reports on public transport, based on electronic information from the vehicles, either using the Internet or kiosks. A kiosk is just a PC designed for public use.\n\nAs the Internet provides the best way to interact with government, all citizens need to use it, even if they don't have PCs themselves. If electronic kiosks that work like bank cash machines are placed in post offices, libraries, schools, and other public buildings, they can help governments improve services while reducing the cost of delivery.\n\nOnline systems are most useful for citizens and most efficient for government when they have more than one purpose. Governments should review all their dealings with citizens that require them to stand in line or fill out forms. Government should bring together all the agencies involved to develop a single system for handling all contact with citizens.\n\nThe Irish government, using An Post, the Irish postal service, has done this best. An Post kiosks process bill payments, issue passports, issue licenses for vehicles, pay benefits, offer savings and investment plans-even sell stamps. Each kiosk is a tiny city hall, covering the work of half a dozen agencies. With many of the 1,000 An Post sites in small towns with fewer than 2,000 residents, the kiosks serve 1,26 million people each week-half the Irish population - and handle more than $9 billion each year. Changing or adding new operations is very easy.\n\nFor government dealings like these, as well as for all commercial deals, security is essential. Security has two elements: protection of personal data while it's moving over the network and identifying the person carrying out the operation. Today there is encryption technology that is strong enough to protect the security of any electronic movement on a network, but US export controls on encryption technology restrict US firms from building it into their products. Since this does not keep encryption technology out of the hands of criminals, the software industry is working to change the US government's mind on this issue. In practice, the encryption that can be used is strong enough that in most cases the security of data in a network is not the weak link. Electronic data is as safe as data in other forms.\n\nIdentifying the user is equally important. You don't want someone else getting into your government records or your bank account. Smart cards are a solution to identity problems, as with the cards for bank cash machines. In Spain a new kiosk system will let anyone find out general information about social benefits by going through a touch-screen menu, but the person needs a smart card to find any personal information.\n\nThough such cards are just like the bank cards used around the world, some people are worried that the government might collect too much information about citizens. Some nations have privacy laws that prevent a single card or database from containing all information about a citizen, so in some nations there will be two cards: one for financial operations with business or government and another for health care.\n\nWidely available information and the ability to put a lot of information on smart cards will cause societies to look again at the question of how information can be used. Should any employer be able to see a job candidate's police record? Or just organizations such as schools, which hire people who work closely with children? In the end these are political questions rather than technological issues. Each country will have to decide on the kinds of personal information that will be allowed on smart cards. Even if their use is restricted to identity only, the efficiency gains and the prevention of fraud are worth the investment. In London, 200 trial kiosks of a system like An Post's reduced benefit payment fraud by 750,000 pounds in the first year. When installed at all 1,500 post offices, the kiosks are expected to save 150 pounds million per year.\n\nLess developed countries may assume that a digital approach to government is out of reach, but countries without systems can start fresh with new technology, which will be less expensive than manual approaches. Developed countries have older systems that often must be joined together.\n\nExamples from around the world make it clear that many of the advances are happening in smaller governments - smaller nations and cities, counties and provinces, and the state levels of larger nations. Smaller governments are less complex and they can experiment and work out solutions on a smaller scale. For larger governments, the lesson is to start with smaller projects to develop the necessary skills and see how citizens respond. Concentrate at first on projects that directly touch citizens and particularly ones that get rid of organizational complications for the public.\n\nKing County in my home state of Washington is probably ahead of many governments in the amount of information it publishes online, but the county does not yet package information or operations simply. To get a building permit in rural King County, you must obtain information from many sources: the phone book, phone calls to the county office, two or three printed documents, and the department's website. A single well-structured website, with all the information and links involving all steps in the building permit process, would remove most of the complications, and could automate some of the steps.\n\nSavings from new digital systems would represent a significant portion of every government's budget. The US military recently found that it was spending more money to process and approve travel permits, $2,3 billion, than it was spending on travel itself, $2 billion. The US government budget is $27 billion for food stamps, $25 billion for social benefits, and $13 billion for public housing. These programs all have enormously expensive paper-based administrative systems that eat up 30 percent of the money. Good digital systems could push this below 10 percent.\n\nCitizens are becoming more aware of the power of the Web and they are no longer willing to accept the idea that government service should be slow or confusing. No customer would stand in line for two hours to get service from a private business. Why should a worker stand in line for two hours at a government office and lose two hours of pay, when by using the Internet he could get his license or pay his fees and be at work on time?\n\nGovernment alone, by building key services around the Internet, will provide a big reason for citizens to move to a Web lifestyle. If the government, usually the largest \"business\" in any country, is a leader in the use of technology, it will automatically lift the country's technical skills and drive the move to an information market. Building an information economy will make all the companies in the country more competitive. The Information Age benefits from having more people involved. As more and more countries join in, the importance increases for all countries. World trade will be done digitally.\n\nNo government can put a fully digital approach in place immediately, but every government can begin now with strong first steps that benefit citizens and make them feel that the government is working for them. The main principle should be that citizens should never again have to fill out lots of forms or go to lots of places to get information.\n\nAs one government official said in conversation about his new website, which lets people download a hundred years of county records online, \"People can tell when you're trying to help. They know the difference between a government agency trying to help them and one that's just getting in the way\".\n\nCreate connected learning communities.\n\nPCs can give more power to teachers and students than any other group of knowledge workers. Students are pure \"knowledge workers,\" since learning is all about acquiring knowledge. Teachers will be able to use the Internet to share with each other and to allow students to explore a subject in new ways. With a solid infrastructure in place, some schools are already benefiting from PCs in the classroom. Many schools struggle to find the resources for these new tools, but clever programs have shown that there are rewards for the effort.\n\nThe success of PCs as educational tools requires teacher involvement. Without teacher training and making PCs central to the teaching program, they will not have a big effect. Many PCs have gone into computer \"laboratories\" where they sit, seldom used. Schools need to shift from treating the PC as a subject - teaching about technology -to including it in all areas of the teaching program: teaching with technology. More and more schools are now showing that PCs used as learning tools can have a strong influence.\n\nIn the Western Heights Independent School District, just west of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, teachers were enthusiastic when the district provided training the summer before it introduced PCs. More than 200 of its 230 teachers signed up. Most teachers have a great love of learning and they'll get excited about anything that will help kids learn. What teachers don't want is to be thrown into something they have not had the opportunity to learn about and become comfortable with.\n\nWestern Heights is a small, seven-school district with a moderate industrial tax base. The student population contains a mix of cultures. About 65 percent of the kids qualify for free or reduced-cost school lunches because they come from homes with lower incomes. This is not the school district that you might expect to lead the advance into the Information Age. But in the past three years the district has voted three times to spend a total of more than $6,8 million in local funds to create maybe the leading technology - based teaching program in the country. The community sees the investment as the only way to break the cycle of poverty that could trap these children if they go unprepared into the digital world.\n\nA PC can be a powerful new teaching tool for teachers. They find they can make kids more interested in lessons by including photos, films, and links to Internet pages. One teacher at Western Heights starts his class each day with fresh news from the Internet. PCs are part of each teacher's life in class at Western Heights. Teachers also use e-mail to communicate with one another about common issues. They don't have to wait for the district meetings that occur a couple of times a year. They can reach out to fellow teachers with questions and get answers back quickly.\n\n\"People may not realize how alone teachers are in the classroom,\" Joe Kitchens of the Schools Department at Western Heights says. \"Most teachers remain behind closed doors all day. They have little time for sharing experiences or interacting with other teachers. There are only a few times a year when they can gather together. E-mail stops them being isolated\". Kitchens also jokes that teachers are able to complain to him more than before. They expect him to answer their questions immediately over e-mail.\n\nAn important way to take advantage of investing in technology is to use the school infrastructure to benefit the entire community. Basic computer skills are one type of education that can be applied in any job. In most countries, one out of every ten information technology (IT) jobs is not filled. The United States and Europe each need more than half a million new trained IT professionals in the next several years. Rapidly developing areas such as India and Latin America may have greater shortages.\n\nHighdown School in Reading, England, is paying for the infrastructure it needs through a mix of private and public money. Highdown School expects the community to contribute. Adults can get online technical training either at the Reading schools, which open on evenings and weekends for that purpose, or at home. Fees for this service go toward maintaining and expanding the IT system.\n\nMost knowledge workers in the United States have their own PC, but even at the best of schools there are usually more than seven students for every PC. It's expensive for schools to buy PCs for every student, especially when PCs become out-of-date every three years or so. For this reason there's a fear that the gap between the \"haves\" - those families that can afford PCs at home-and the \"have-nots\"-those that cannot afford PCs at home - will create a major gap in opportunities. Creative approaches in providing PCs to every student are beginning to help solve this problem.\n\nOne project started in the early 1990s in Melbourne, Australia, where Bruce Dixon, a teacher interested in technology, saw significant differences in teaching results when he could use half a dozen computers for his classes instead of just one. He realized that, for the best results, students had to use PCs as a tool for all their work - in all their classes and at home as well as at school.\n\nOut of many meetings came the idea of having all the students finance their own machines. Dixon, by then a technology advisor, worked out a financial plan. For a monthly fee, students get a machine and software. The seller provides service, and when the student graduates the family keeps the machine. It's still difficult for all families to afford the fees. Families that are wealthier can afford the typical forty-dollar monthly fee over a three-year period. Many families can afford to pay a small amount. Business and community organizations can make up the difference. Whatever the amount, the family contribution is basic to this program, as it gives the students and their parents a sense of owning and being responsible for the computer and for its role in the students' education.\n\nPrograms like this have spread to schools all over the world. The effects have been impressive. A recent report shows that students who regularly use computers gain many skills. They write more often and better; they have better analysis skills; they express themselves more creatively; they work more independently, and they are better at problem solving and critical thinking.\n\nOne of the most forward-looking ideas is to use PCs to offer a variety of ways to learn. About fifty different major theories attempt to describe individual learning styles. Most of the theories identify similar qualities. In the simplest terms, some people learn better by reading, some by listening, some by watching someone else do a task, some by doing the task. Most of us learn by a mix of all of these methods. And all people have different levels of ability and different personalities and life experiences that affect how well they learn. New software is helping students learn, whatever their learning style or ability. Software can present information in many different forms that can be adapted to the individual student much more easily than paper methods.\n\nPCs can help change the learning experience from the traditional approach - a teacher talking at the front of a classroom, with reading tasks - to a more hands-on approach that takes advantage of the natural curiosity of students of all ages. PCs enable students to explore information at their own speed, to learn from sound and pictures as well as from text, to do experiments, and to work together with other students.\n\nPCs are the primary tools for working and communicating in the digital age. The PC and the Internet change one thing completely: they provide every student in every school and community with information and ways of working that, before now, were not available even to students at the best schools. Educators will take advantage of that to help their communities. PCs are a new teaching and learning tool, and educators who use them will be the agents of change.\n\nChapter five.\n\nExpect the Unexpected.\n\nPrepare for the digital future.\n\nCustomers are the main people who benefit from the increased efficiency of information technology, and the benefits will increase as the economy becomes more digital. The other people who benefit are business people who take advantage of digital methods faster than their competitors. The solutions I have talked about in this book are the result of the vision and leadership of business people who used IT to serve their customers better.\n\nBusiness leaders who succeed will take advantage of a new way of doing business, a way based on the increasing speed of information. The new way is not to apply technology for its own sake, but to use it to change how companies act. To get the full benefit of technology, business leaders will make their processes and their organizations simpler and more modern. The goal is to make business responses nearly immediate, and to make strategic thought a process that goes on all the time - not something that's done every twelve to eighteen months, separate from the daily flow of business.\n\nNew technology should provide better information to every worker who might possibly use it. Knowledge workers are the brains of the company. If they're disconnected from the company's important data, how can they work, how can they take responsibility? You can give people tasks and authority, but without information they can't do anything. Knowledge is the best power tool. If important information about production systems, product problems, customer crises and opportunities, lost sales, and other important business news gets through the organization in minutes instead of days, and if the right people can be working on the issues within hours instead of days, a business obtains a huge advantage. This change in the structure of processes is more important than any other change since mass production.\n\nEvery company can choose whether to lead or follow the digital trends. The Internet is changing the basis of industries in real time. Winning is not easy. Digital information flow and giving power to employees is part of achieving and maintaining competitive advantage. A belief in giving people power is the key to getting the most out of a digital nervous system. Knowledge workers and business managers benefit from more and better information, not just senior management. When employees get a couple of good tools that deliver better results, they demand more. It's a positive cycle.\n\nHowever you organize your company, one thing is clear: it is impossible to manage a company totally from the center. It is impossible for a single person or group of people to stay on top of every issue in every area of a business. Leaders need to provide planning and direction and to give employees tools that enable them to gather information and understanding from around the world. Companies that try to direct every action from the center will simply not be able to move fast enough to cope with the speed of the new economy.\n\nIn business the argument between central authority and the individual is the difference between the old-style way of thinking, which saw workers as lazy people who needed to be controlled, and the theory that workers are creative and should be given responsibility. Digital processes support the idea that workers can - and will - do more if allowed, enabled, and encouraged to think and act.\n\nThis argument about the center and the individual is not just academic. The choice affects the design of companies and systems. The design of the first manned space ship shocked the original pilots years ago. There were no manual flight controls. Don't worry, said the scientists. The system would fly the ship. The pilots, like the monkeys before them, were just there for the ride. The pilots resisted. They all had experience of \"advanced\" systems that failed when things got difficult. The pilots won, and on several flights the pilots' skill brought them home safely when the central, programmed system failed. The issue is not whether computers can fly better than pilots. Today planes and space ships use large amounts of computer technology to extend the human ability to fly. The issue is whether someone \"at the center,\" away from the real circumstances, can possibly predict all of the things that can change or go wrong - whether in space or in a business office.\n\nMany parts of business can be improved through digital systems, but it will take a number of years to improve every single part. Every bit of data in a company should be in digital form, and easy to find, including every file, every record, every piece of e-mail, every webpage. Every internal process should be digital and connected to every other process. Every operation with partners and customers should be digital. You should allow partners and customers to have all the data that is appropriate to them, and they should do the same for you.\n\nHuman beings are not the biggest animals, the strongest or fastest, or the sharpest in sight or smell. We survived and grew successful because of our brains. We learned how to use tools, to build shelter, to invent agriculture, to keep farm animals, to develop civilization and culture, to cure and prevent disease. Our tools and technologies have helped us to shape the environment around us.\n\nI'm a positive person. I believe in progress. I'd much rather be alive today than at any time in history - and not just because in an earlier age my skills wouldn't have been as valuable and I'd have been a good candidate for an animal's dinner. The tools of the Industrial Age extended the capacities of our muscles. The tools of the digital age extend the capacities of our minds. I'm even happier for my children, who will grow up in this new world.\n\nBy joining the digital age enthusiastically, we can accelerate the positive effects and do better with the challenges, such as privacy and the problem of \"haves\" and \"have-nots\". If we sit back and wait for the digital age to come to us on terms defined by others, we won't be able to do either. The Web lifestyle can increase the involvement of citizens in government. Many of the decisions that need to be made are political and social, not technical. These include how we make sure that everyone can get on the Web and how we protect children. Citizens in every culture must join in the discussion about the effects of digital technology, to make sure that the new digital age reflects the society they want to create.\n\nThe digital world certainly makes it tough and uncertain for business, but we will all benefit. We're going to get improved products and services, better responses to complaints, lower costs, and more choices. We're going to get better government and social services that cost a lot less. This world is coming. A big part of it comes through businesses using a digital nervous system to improve their processes. A digital nervous system can help business define itself and its role in the future, but success or failure depends on business leaders. Only you can prepare your organization and invest in ways that take advantage of the rapidly dawning digital age.\n\nDigital tools extend the abilities that make us unique in the world: the ability to think, the ability to express our thoughts, the ability to work together to act on those thoughts. I strongly believe that if companies give their employees the power to solve problems, and give them powerful tools to do this with, they will always be amazed at how much creative and independent thinking will appear.\n\n",
        "ru": "Глава первая. Информационный поток - это ваша жизненная сила.\n\nИнформационная работа - это работа мышления. Когда мышлению и совместной работе значительно помогают компьютерные технологии, у вас есть цифровая нервная система. Он состоит из передовых цифровых процессов, которые работники умственного труда используют для принятия лучших решений - думать, действовать, реагировать и адаптироваться. Майкл Дертузос из Массачусетского технологического института пишет, что будущий \"информационный рынок\" потребует большого количества специального программного обеспечения и сложных комбинаций человеческих и машинных процессов - отличное описание работы цифровой нервной системы.\n\nРассматриваете ли вы информационные технологии как способ решения конкретных проблем? Тогда вы, вероятно, получаете только часть преимуществ, которые могут предоставить современные компьютеры и программное обеспечение. Вместо этого вы должны создавать системы, которые будут немедленно доставлять информацию любому, кто может ее использовать, - \"цифровые нервные системы\".\n\nКак руководитель Microsoft, самой успешной в мире компании по разработке программного обеспечения, я сыграл большую роль в рождении информационной эры. В этой книге я объясняю идею цифровой нервной системы-использование информационных технологий для удовлетворения потребностей людей на работе и дома, так же как человеческая нервная система поддерживает человеческий разум.\n\nКак и живое существо, организация работает лучше всего, если она может полагаться на нервную систему, которая немедленно посылает информацию тем частям, которые в ней нуждаются. Цифровая нервная система может объединить все системы и процессы организации, высвобождая потоки информации и позволяя бизнесу совершать огромные скачки в эффективности, росте и прибыли. У меня есть простое, но сильное убеждение: то, как вы собираете, управляете и используете информацию, решит, выиграете вы или проиграете.\n\nЛучший способ установить дистанцию между вашей компанией и толпой-это отлично работать с информацией. Сегодня конкурентов стало больше. Существует больше информации о них и о рынке, который сейчас находится во всем мире. Победителями станут те, кто разработает цифровую нервную систему мирового уровня, чтобы информация могла легко проходить через их компании для максимального и постоянного обучения.\n\nЯ знаю, что вы скажете: нет, это эффективные процессы! Это качество! Это завоевание доли рынка и создание узнаваемых брендов! Он приближается к клиентам! Успех, конечно, зависит от всего этого. Никто не сможет помочь вам, если ваши процессы неэффективны, если вы не заботитесь о качестве, если вы не усердно работаете над созданием своего бренда, если ваше обслуживание клиентов плохое. Плохой бизнес-план потерпит неудачу, как бы хороша ни была ваша информация. А плохая практика испортит хороший план. Если вы сделаете достаточно плохих вещей, вы выйдете из бизнеса.\n\nНо что бы ни было на вашей стороне сегодня-умные сотрудники, отличные продукты, лояльные клиенты, наличные деньги в банке - вам нужен быстрый поток хорошей информации, чтобы сделать процессы эффективными, повысить качество и улучшить то, как вы реализуете свой план на практике. В большинстве компаний работают хорошие люди. Большинство компаний хотят хорошо относиться к своим клиентам. Хорошие, полезные данные существуют где-то внутри большинства организаций. Информационный поток-это жизненная сила вашей компании, потому что он позволяет вам получать максимальную отдачу от ваших сотрудников и учиться у ваших клиентов. Посмотрите, есть ли у вас информация, чтобы ответить на эти вопросы:\n\n- Что клиенты думают о вашей продукции? Какие проблемы они хотят, чтобы вы исправили? Какие новые функции они хотят, чтобы вы добавили?\n\n- Какие проблемы возникают у ваших партнеров, когда они продают вашу продукцию или работают с вами?\n\n- Где ваши конкуренты выигрывают бизнес у вас и почему?\n\n- Изменяющиеся требования клиентов заставят вас развивать новые мощности?\n\n- Какие новые рынки появляются, на которые вы должны выйти?\n\nЦифровая нервная система не гарантирует вам правильных ответов на эти вопросы. Но это освободит вас от старых бумажных процессов, так что у вас будет время подумать над вопросами. Это даст вам данные, чтобы начать думать немедленно,и увидеть тенденции, идущие на вас. Цифровая нервная система позволит фактам и идеям быстро всплыть из глубин вашей организации, от людей, у которых есть информация об этих вопросах и, вероятно, многие ответы. Самое главное, это позволит вам делать все эти вещи быстро.\n\nСтарая деловая шутка гласит, что если бы железные дороги понимали, что они занимаются транспортным бизнесом, а не сталелитейным, мы бы все летали на \"Юнион Пасифик Эйрлайнз\". Многие компании изменили свои цели еще более фундаментальными способами. Но не всегда ясно, где находится следующая возможность роста.\n\nMcdonald'S имеет самый сильный бренд и долю рынка, а также хорошую репутацию за качество. Но недавно проведенный анализ рынка предложил компании изменить свою бизнес-модель. Mcdonald's время от времени продвигал игрушки, связанные с фильмами. Анализ показал, что компания должна использовать свой хорошо известный мелкодоходный продукт для продажи высокодоходных игрушек, а не наоборот. Такое изменение маловероятно, но не немыслимо в современном быстро меняющемся деловом мире.\n\nНи одна компания не может считать, что ее положение на рынке безопасно. Компания должна постоянно думать о своих возможностях. Одна компания может быть чрезвычайно успешной, если она ворвется в другой бизнес. Другая компания может обнаружить, что ей следует придерживаться того, что она знает и делает лучше всего. Самое главное, что менеджеры компании имеют информацию, чтобы понять, где они могут конкурировать и каким может быть их следующий большой рынок.\n\nЭта книга поможет вам использовать информационные технологии, чтобы задать и ответить на трудные вопросы о том, каким должен быть ваш бизнес и куда он должен идти. Информационные технологии дают вам данные, которые ведут к более глубокому пониманию вашего бизнеса. Это позволяет вам действовать быстро. Он предоставляет решения бизнес-задач, которые просто не были доступны раньше. Информационные технологии и бизнес становятся настолько тесно связанными, что вы не можете говорить об одном, не говоря о другом.\n\nПервый шаг в ответе на любой трудный деловой вопрос-взглянуть на факты. Это легче сказать, чем сделать. Этот принцип проиллюстрирован в моей любимой бизнес-книге \"Мои годы в General Motors\" Альфреда Слоуна-младшего. Если Вы читаете только одну деловую книгу, прочтите книгу Слоана (но не откладывайте ее, чтобы сделать это). Экстраординарный успех может быть достигнут благодаря позитивному лидерству, основанному на информации и разуме.\n\nВо время пребывания Слоуна на посту босса, с 1923 по 1956 год, General Motors стала одной из первых действительно сложных бизнес-организаций в Соединенных Штатах. Слоан понимал, что компания не может разработать широкий бизнес-план или выбрать правильные проекты, не опираясь на факты и понимание людей в компании. Он развил собственное понимание бизнеса, работая в тесном контакте со своими сотрудниками и регулярно посещая технические отделы компании. Однако наибольшее влияние на него как менеджера оказали рабочие отношения с дилерами GM по всей стране. Он постоянно собирал информацию от дилеров GM и работал над тем, чтобы наладить с ними тесные отношения, которые давали результаты.\n\nСлоан считала, что ознакомительные поездки очень важны. Поэтому он построил офис в частном железнодорожном вагоне и путешествовал по всей стране, посещая дилеров. Он часто видел от пяти до десяти дилеров в день. Эти визиты помогли Слоану увидеть, что автомобильный бизнес меняется. Он перешел от простой продажи к торговле, поскольку люди хотели обменять свои старые автомобили, когда они покупали новые. Слоан понимал, что отношения GM с дилерами тоже должны измениться. Производитель и дилеры должны были стать партнерами. Слоан сформировал дилерский совет, чтобы регулярно встречаться с высшими руководителями GM. Он также создал отдел для рассмотрения жалоб от дилеров. Он платил за экономические исследования, чтобы найти лучшие места для новых дилеров, и даже нашел способ одалживать деньги \"способным людям\", у которых не было денег, чтобы стать дилерами.\n\nТочную информацию о продажах по-прежнему было трудно найти. Когда прибыль дилера падала, GM не знала почему. Без фактов невозможно было понять, что делать. Слоан сказал, что заплатит много денег, чтобы каждый дилер \" знал факты о своем бизнесе и мог разумно разобраться со многими деталями... в интеллигентной манере\". Это будет \"лучшая инвестиция, которую когда-либо делал General Motors\".\n\nСлоан создал стандартизированную систему счетов для всей организации GM и всех ее дилеров. Каждый дилер и каждый сотрудник, на каждом уровне компании, помещают свои номера в точно такие же категории. К середине 1930-х годов дилеры GM, ее заводы и офисы могли проводить детальный финансовый анализ, используя одни и те же цифры. Дилер, например, мог четко видеть, насколько хорошо он работает, а также сравнивать свои результаты со средними показателями по всей компании.\n\nИнфраструктура, предоставляющая точную информацию, привела к тому, что компания быстро реагировала на события. Другие автопроизводители десятилетиями не могли конкурировать с GM. Эта инфраструктура - то, что я называю нервной системой компании, - помогала GM доминировать в автомобильном бизнесе на протяжении всей карьеры Слоана. Он еще не был цифровым, но был чрезвычайно ценным.\n\nКонечно, тогда вы не могли получить почти столько же информации, проходящей через вашу компанию, сколько сейчас. Потребовалось бы слишком много телефонных звонков и слишком много людей, перемещающих бумагу и просматривающих данные, чтобы найти закономерности. Это было бы очень дорого. Если вы хотите управлять компанией мирового класса сегодня, вам нужно получить гораздо больше данных и сделать это гораздо быстрее. Чтобы управлять силой фактов - один из бизнес-принципов Слоуна-требуются информационные технологии.\n\nЕсли семьдесят лет назад управление информацией и быстрое реагирование имели такое фундаментальное значение в традиционной отрасли, то насколько большее значение они будут иметь, когда будут питаться информационными технологиями? Современный автопроизводитель может сегодня иметь сильную марку и репутацию качества, но он сталкивается с еще большей конкуренцией со всего мира.\n\nВсе автопроизводители используют одну и ту же сталь и одни и те же машины; у них схожие производственные процессы и примерно одинаковые транспортные расходы. Сегодня критерием успеха является то, насколько хорошо они разрабатывают свои продукты, насколько разумно они используют информацию от своих клиентов для улучшения своих продуктов и услуг, насколько быстро они могут улучшить свои производственные процессы, насколько умно они продают свои продукты и насколько эффективно они поставляют свои продукты и услуги клиентам. Все эти процессы богаты информацией, и они извлекают выгоду из цифровых технологий.\n\nЦенность цифрового подхода особенно очевидна в таких компаниях, как банки и страховые компании, где информация занимает центральное место в бизнесе. В банковском деле данные о клиентах - это сердце бизнеса, и банки всегда были большими пользователями информационных технологий. Crestar Bank of Richmond, штат Вирджиния, предлагает все свои банковские услуги через Интернет. У него есть банковские служащие в супермаркетах и торговых центрах, которые могут предлагать банковские услуги клиентам, используя цифровой информационный поток.\n\nВ эпоху интернета и растущей конкуренции на финансовых рынках ключом к успеху является разумность использования банком данных и то, насколько хорошо он реагирует на своих клиентов. Именно мозги дают преимущество тому или иному банку. Но я имею в виду не только индивидуальные способности банковских служащих. Я имею в виду общую способность банка использовать лучшее мышление всех своих сотрудников.\n\nПосле появления ENIAC, первого компьютера общего назначения, во время Второй мировой войны компьютеры быстро доказали, что они быстрее и точнее людей во многих задачах. Однако компьютеры работали не на высоком уровне. Они помогали людям, но не разумно. Требуется мозг, чтобы понять физику ракеты; требуется компьютер, чтобы сделать вычисления за секунды.\n\nБизнесу нужна другая работа - \"информационная\". Эта фраза принадлежит Майклу Дертузосу, директору лаборатории компьютерных наук Массачусетского технологического института и автору книги \"Что будет\". Обычно мы воспринимаем информацию-письмо, фотографию или финансовый отчет-как нечто неизменное. Но Дертузос утверждает, что активна и другая форма информации. Информационная работа - это обработка информации человеческим мозгом или компьютерными программами.\n\nИнформационная работа-проектирование здания, заключение сделки, заполнение налоговых форм-это большая часть работы, выполняемой в развитых странах. По оценкам дертузоса, информационная работа составляет от 50 до 60 процентов от общей стоимости товаров и услуг, производимых промышленно развитой страной.\n\nИдея Dertouzos важно. Когда компьютеры перешли от простой работы с числами к моделированию бизнес-задач, они начали играть определенную роль в информационной работе. Даже производственные фирмы всегда вкладывали больше энергии в информацию о работе, чем в саму работу: информацию о дизайне и разработке продукта; о маркетинге, продажах и поставках; о платежах и финансах; о сотрудничестве с продавцами; об обслуживании клиентов.\n\nЧтобы заниматься информационной работой, люди в компании должны уметь легко находить информацию. Однако до недавнего времени нам говорили, что \"номера\" должны быть зарезервированы для самых старших руководителей. Иногда есть веские причины для секретности, но обычно информация была зарезервирована просто потому, что для перемещения информации требовалось время, деньги и усилия, поэтому вы должны были быть старшим, чтобы заказать работу. В современных компьютерных сетях можно легко и дешево найти и представить данные. Вы можете погрузиться в данные до самого низкого уровня детализации и посмотреть на них с разных сторон. Вы можете обмениваться информацией и идеями с другими людьми. Вы можете объединить идеи и работу многих людей для лучшего результата.\n\nНам нужно перестать думать, что получение информации и перемещение информации-это сложно и дорого. Это просто элементарный здравый смысл, чтобы сделать все данные вашей компании легко доступными для каждого человека, который может их использовать.\n\nВсе сотрудники компании, а не только ее высокопоставленные руководители, должны видеть бизнес-данные. Для меня, как для главного исполнительного директора, важно понимать, как работает компания в разных регионах, продуктовых линейках или различных типах клиентов, и я горжусь тем, что всегда в курсе событий. Однако именно менеджеры среднего звена в каждой компании должны понимать, откуда берутся их прибыли и убытки, какие маркетинговые программы работают или нет, а какие расходы находятся под контролем или слишком высоки. Это люди, которым нужны точные, полезные данные, потому что именно они должны действовать. Они не должны ждать, пока высшее руководство принесет им информацию. Компании должны тратить меньше времени на защиту финансовых данных от сотрудников и больше времени на обучение их анализу и действиям.\n\nВо многих компаниях менеджеры среднего звена могут утонуть в повседневных проблемах и не иметь информации, необходимой для их решения. Признаком хорошей цифровой нервной системы является то, что менеджеры среднего звена становятся более эффективными благодаря потоку точной, полезной информации. Системы должны сообщать им о необычных событиях-например, если статья расходов слишком высока. Тогда менеджерам не нужно смотреть на нормальную расходную деятельность. Некоторые компании работают подобным образом, но я постоянно удивляюсь тому, как мало компаний используют информационные технологии, чтобы держать своих менеджеров среднего звена в курсе и избегать рутинной проверки.\n\nМеня поражает извилистый путь, по которому важная информация часто проходит через многие компании из списка Fortune 500. В Mcdonald'S до недавнего времени данные о продажах приходилось \"трогать\" вручную несколько раз, прежде чем они попадали к людям, которые в них нуждались. Сегодня Mcdonald's устанавливает новую информационную систему, которая обрабатывает продажи во всех своих ресторанах в режиме реального времени. Как только вы закажете два Happy Meals, менеджер по маркетингу Mcdonald's узнает об этом. Так что у менеджера будут твердые факты для анализа продаж, а не ненадежные данные.\n\nКак мы увидим в описании реакции Microsoft на интернет, еще одним признаком хорошей цифровой нервной системы является количество хороших идей, исходящих от ваших менеджеров среднего звена и работников умственного труда. Когда они могут анализировать реальные данные, люди получают подробные идеи о том, как сделать вещи лучше-и они тоже возбуждаются. Людям нравится знать, что то, что они делают, работает, и им нравится показывать менеджерам, что это работает. Им нравится использовать технологии, которые побуждают их проверять различные теории о том, что происходит на их рынках. Люди действительно ценят информацию.\n\nПоследний признак хорошей цифровой нервной системы - насколько эффективны ваши личные встречи. Хорошие встречи - это результат хорошей подготовки. Встречи не должны использоваться главным образом для представления информации. Более эффективно использовать электронную почту, чтобы люди могли анализировать данные перед встречей. Затем они будут готовы внести свои предложения и обсудить вопросы на самой встрече.\n\nКомпании, которые борются со слишком большим количеством непродуктивных встреч, не испытывают недостатка в энергии и мозгах. Данные, которые им нужны, существуют где-то в компании в той или иной форме. Цифровые инструменты позволят им получать данные немедленно, из многих источников,и анализировать их под разными углами.\n\nАльфред Слоун из GM сказал, что без фактов невозможно реализовать эффективный план. Я считаю, что если у вас есть хорошие факты, вы можете привести в действие эффективный план. Слоан так и сделала, много раз. При той скорости, с которой сегодня движется бизнес, нам как никогда необходимо управлять силой фактов.\n\nТо, что я описываю здесь,-это новый уровень анализа информации, который позволяет работникам умственного труда превращать необработанные данные в активную информацию-то, что Майкл Дертузос называет знанием как глаголом. Цифровая нервная система позволяет компании выполнять информационную работу с большей эффективностью, глубиной и креативностью.\n\nМожет ли ваша цифровая нервная система сделать это?\n\nКак и человеку, компании нужна внутренняя коммуникационная система, \"нервная система\", чтобы организовать свои действия. Все предприятия концентрируются на нескольких основных вещах: клиенты, продукты и услуги, доходы, затраты, конкуренты, доставка и сотрудники. Компания должна выполнять бизнес-процессы в каждой области и следить за тем, чтобы они работали вместе, особенно в тех видах деятельности, которые пересекают отделы.\n\nОтдел продаж должен быстро выяснить, может ли компания поставлять продукт, прежде чем обещать доставить большой заказ. Производственный отдел должен знать, какой продукт сильно продается, чтобы он мог изменить приоритеты производства. Бизнес-менеджеры всей компании должны знать и о том, и о другом-и о многом другом.\n\nНервная система организации имеет параллели с нашей человеческой нервной системой. У каждого бизнеса есть определенные процессы, которые должны продолжаться, чтобы компания выжила, точно так же, как человеческое сердце должно продолжать биться. Необходимость быть эффективными и надежными побудила компании автоматизировать многие из этих основных операций. Но из-за того, что менеджеры принимали любые доступные решения, результатом со временем стало большое количество систем, которые не всегда работают вместе. Каждая независимая система может работать безотказно сама по себе, но данные в каждой изолированы и их трудно объединить с данными в других. Получение данных об операционных процессах и их использование - одна из самых сложных задач бизнеса. Но современные технологии могут сделать базовые операции основой гораздо более широкого, общекорпоративного интеллекта.\n\nКомпания должна быстро и хорошо реагировать на любой кризис или незапланированное событие. Возможно, Вам позвонит ваш лучший клиент и скажет, что он покупает у вашего крупнейшего конкурента, или этот конкурент может представить отличный новый продукт, или у вас может быть неисправный продукт или сломанная операция. Незапланированные события тоже могут быть позитивными. Вы можете получить неожиданную возможность для новой крупной деятельности или покупки.\n\nНаконец, существует сознательное управление мускулами вашей компании, независимо от того, создаете ли Вы команды для разработки новых продуктов, открываете новые офисы или посылаете людей, чтобы завоевать новых клиентов. Для успешного проведения этих запланированных мероприятий требуется тщательное обдумывание и стратегический анализ до и после того, как вы начнете действовать.\n\nВам нужно подумать об основных бизнес-проблемах вашей компании и разработать долгосрочный бизнес-план для решения проблем и использования возможностей, которые открывает ваш анализ. Затем вам нужно сообщить о том, что вы хотите сделать, и о планах, стоящих за этим, каждому человеку в компании, а также партнерам и другим соответствующим людям за пределами компании.\n\nОднако больше всего компания должна общаться со своими клиентами и действовать в соответствии с тем, что она узнает от них. Эта первичная потребность включает в себя все возможности компании: оперативную эффективность, сбор данных, сотрудничество, стратегическое планирование и действия. Необходимость общения с клиентами будет вновь и вновь подчеркиваться в этой книге. Я покажу, как цифровая нервная система помогает успешным компаниям делать это.\n\nЦифровая нервная система служит двум основным целям в развитии понимания бизнеса. Он расширяет способность индивида к анализу так же, как машины расширяют физические возможности, и он объединяет способности индивидов создавать интеллект компании и действовать как единое целое. Цифровая нервная система стремится создать совершенство компании из индивидуального совершенства, чтобы служить клиенту.\n\nЦифровая нервная система дает людям, работающим в вашей компании, те же самые данные для ежедневного использования в бизнесе, которые вы даете кому-то, кого вы привлекаете, чтобы проконсультироваться с ними о проблеме. С их многолетним опытом работы в отрасли и знаниями бизнес-анализа консультанты часто приходят с новыми идеями после того, как они изучили данные. Но разве это не безумие, что кто-то за пределами компании получает больше информации, чем вы используете для себя? Слишком часто важная информация о клиентах и продажах сводится воедино только тогда, когда приходит консультант. Вы должны иметь эту информацию там каждый день, готовую к использованию вашими сотрудниками. Ваши менеджеры должны иметь информацию того же качества, что и консультант. Как мы увидим в следующем примере, хорошие вещи случаются, когда у них есть эта информация.\n\nВ Microsoft наша команда продаж обращается только к крупным корпорациям.\n\nПоэтому каждый год Джефф Рейкс, человек, отвечающий за продажи и поддержку, борется с проблемой того, как выйти на рынок для мелких и средних клиентов. Мы обычно достигаем этих клиентов через семинары и маркетинг с партнерами. Но где же большинство этих клиентов? Все ли они в крупнейших городах? Какие города мы должны выбрать для маркетинга?\n\nИз интернета мы нашли среднее количество сотрудников на одну компанию в каждом городе. От сторонних консультантов мы получили информацию о количестве персональных компьютеров (ПК) в каждом городе. От наших менеджеров по маркетингу мы получили информацию о наших семинарах и работе с партнерами. Наконец, мы включили количество партнеров в каждом городе.\n\nИспользуя компьютеры, мы искали соответствие между цифрами продаж и маркетинговой активностью. Программа Microsoft, MS Sales, дала нам данные в двух важных областях: данные о продажах за прошлый год, которые помогли нам рассчитать рост, и доход от продаж по почтовым районам. Мы нашли восемьдесят городов, которые, по нашему мнению, были вероятными кандидатами для новой маркетинговой кампании. Но в Microsoft, прежде чем вкладывать деньги, мы хотим знать, сработает ли эта идея. Мы снова проверили восемьдесят городов с помощью маркетинговой программы, ища восемь к одному рентабельности инвестиций (ROI). Установив ROI на уровне восемь к одному, мы могли бы исключить любые города, где процентная доходность может быть высокой, но абсолютная доходность в долларах будет низкой. Это дало нам сорок пять городов, позже уменьшенных до тридцати восьми.\n\nВ каждом из этих тридцати восьми городов, в которых мы раньше не занимались маркетингом, мы провели два \"больших дня\". В каждый большой день мы показывали продукты Microsoft и делали предложения по продажам вместе с нашими партнерами. Рентабельность инвестиций была удивительной-двадцать к одному-30 миллионов долларов прибыли на 1,5 миллиона долларов инвестиций. По мере того, как происходили события большого дня, мы использовали программу MS Sales для измерения нашей доходности по сравнению с цифрами на аналогичных рынках, чтобы увидеть, действительно ли большие дни имели значение. Результаты: города, в которых мы проводили мероприятия большого дня, показали 57-процентное увеличение дохода против 16-процентного увеличения дохода в контрольной группе из девятнадцати небольших городов, в которых не было больших дней.\n\nСегодня программа, которая определила целевые города, была усовершенствована, так что каждый в компании может видеть будущие возможности продаж не только по площади, но и по продукту. Поэтому вместо семинара со всеми продуктами Microsoft мы можем узнать, нужен ли одному городу семинар по Microsoft Office, другому-по Windows, а третьему-по Exchange.\n\nВсе это из-за программы продаж MS. Бумажная система не могла бы выполнить эту работу. Данные о продажах теперь поступают к нам таким образом, что мы можем сразу же поместить их в MS Sales. Это недорого, и поскольку мы делимся этими данными с нашими партнерами, обсуждение с ними будущих маркетинговых планов дает лучшие результаты. Эти обсуждения все еще являются старомодными очными встречами, но все на этих встречах лучше подготовлены из-за данных, которые они видели заранее.\n\nВ Microsoft наши информационные системы также изменили роль наших менеджеров. Когда MS Sales впервые вышла в интернет, один из наших менеджеров в Миннеаполисе проверил продажи в ее районе на уровне деталей, который раньше был невозможен. Она обнаружила, что отличные общие показатели продаж в ее районе скрывают плохие продажи крупным клиентам. Выяснение этого стало шоком для большой команды по продажам клиентов, но это также был первый шаг к тому, чтобы все исправить. К концу года Миннеаполис стал самым быстрорастущим районом для продаж крупным клиентам.\n\nЕсли вы сегодня менеджер в Microsoft, вы должны быть не просто хорошим руководителем отдела продаж. Теперь вы можете быть бизнес-мыслителем, потому что у вас есть данные, которые помогут вам управлять вашим бизнесом. Вы можете посмотреть на показатели продаж и увидеть, где ваш бизнес силен, а где слаб, и какие продукты вы можете продавать, в каких областях, в каких фирмах. Вы можете попробовать новые программы и посмотреть на результаты. Вы можете поговорить с другими менеджерами о том, что они делают, чтобы получить хорошие результаты. Менеджеры в Microsoft играют сейчас гораздо более важную роль, чем пять лет назад, благодаря разработанным нами простым в использовании компьютерным программам.\n\nЦифровая нервная система дает своим пользователям понимание и способность узнавать вещи, которые они иначе не имели бы. Хороший поток информации и хорошие инструменты для анализа позволяют нам видеть новые возможности для получения прибыли среди больших объемов данных. Она наилучшим образом использует возможности человеческого мозга и сокращает человеческий труд.\n\nЧтобы начать создавать цифровую нервную систему, вы должны сначала составить идеальную картину информации, необходимой для ведения бизнеса и понимания рынков и конкурентов. Подумайте хорошенько о фактах, которые вам нужно знать. Составьте список наиболее важных вопросов для вашего бизнеса. Затем потребуйте, чтобы ваши информационные системы предоставили ответы. Если ваша нынешняя система не будет этого делать, вам нужно разработать такую, которая будет. Если вы этого не сделаете, это сделает один или несколько ваших конкурентов.\n\nВы знаете, что создали отличную цифровую нервную систему, когда информация течет через вашу организацию так же быстро и естественно, как мысль в человеческом существе, и когда вы можете использовать технологию для организации команд людей так же быстро, как вы можете управлять человеком. Это бизнес со скоростью мысли.\n\nЦифровые технологии могут полностью изменить ваши производственные процессы и бизнес-процессы. Он также может освободить работников от медленных бумажных процессов. Замена бумажных процессов цифровыми позволяет работникам умственного труда выполнять более полезную работу. Полностью цифровое рабочее место обычно называют \"безбумажным офисом\", фраза, которая восходит по крайней мере к 1973 году. Это великое видение. Больше никаких стопок бумаги, в которых вы не можете найти то, что вам нужно. Больше никаких поисков в кучах отчетов, чтобы найти маркетинговую информацию или номер продаж. Но безбумажный офис, похоже, так и не появился.\n\nКорпорация Xerox сделала для продвижения этой концепции больше, чем любая другая компания. В 1974-5 годах речь шла о \"офисе будущего\", который будет иметь компьютеры и электронную почту с информацией онлайн. Между 1975 и 1987 годами несколько деловых газет обещали, что безбумажный офис не за горами, но в 1988 году я сказал журналисту: \"это видение безбумажного офиса все еще очень, очень далеко\".\n\nСегодня у нас есть все необходимое для создания безбумажного офиса. Более совершенные компьютеры и программное обеспечение позволяют легко комбинировать данные различных типов. Высокоэффективные сетевые компьютеры есть везде в офисной среде. Интернет соединяет компьютеры по всему миру. Но использование бумаги продолжает удваиваться каждые четыре года, и 95 процентов всей информации в Соединенных Штатах остается на бумаге, по сравнению с только 1 процентом, хранящимся в электронном виде. Бумага растет быстрее, чем цифровые технологии могут ее уменьшить!\n\nВ 1996 году я решил посмотреть, как Microsoft все еще использует бумагу. К моему удивлению, в тот год мы напечатали 350 000 бумажных копий отчетов о продажах. Я попросил копию каждой бумажной формы, которую мы использовали. Толстая папка, лежавшая на моем столе, содержала сотни и сотни бланков. Использование бумаги было лишь признаком более серьезной проблемы: административные процессы были слишком сложными и занимали слишком много времени.\n\nЯ посмотрел на папку и подумал: \"Зачем нам все эти бланки? У каждого здесь есть компьютер. Мы связаны. Почему мы не используем электронные формы и электронную почту\"? Как главный исполнительный директор я отдал приказ запретить все ненужные формы. Вместо всей этой бумаги выросли системы, которые были более точными и простыми в работе и которые освободили наших людей для более интересной работы.\n\nТеперь, еще до того, как мы нанимаем нового работника, он или она начинает электронное путешествие. Мы получаем информацию о карьере от 600 до 900 человек, претендующих на работу каждый день, через почту, по электронной почте по адресу resume@microsoft.com. или на веб-сайте Microsoft по адресу www.microsoft.com/jobs. Семьдесят процентов информации о карьере теперь поступает по электронной почте или на веб-сайт, по сравнению с 6 процентами два года назад. Вся информация о карьере от людей, претендующих на работу, сопоставляется с открытыми рабочими местами в течение сорока восьми часов, иногда в течение двадцати четырех часов.\n\nПрограммное обеспечение настраивает собеседования. Каждый интервьюер получает информацию о карьере человека, претендующего на эту работу, по электронной почте. После собеседования каждый интервьюер присылает свои комментарии кандидату по электронной почте. Такой обмен информацией гарантирует, что интервьюеры будут опираться на работу друг друга,а не повторять ее. Если очевидно, что Microsoft хочет кандидата, сигнал электронной почты говорит интервьюеру объяснить этому человеку, почему Microsoft будет хорошим выбором для него.\n\nДопустим, некто по имени Шэрон Холлоуэй принимает наше предложение о работе. Воображаемая Шарон-одна из восьмидесяти пяти новых сотрудников, которых мы нанимаем каждую неделю. Скажем, что Шарон в Редмонде, штат Вашингтон. Прежде чем Шарон приходит в Microsoft, помощник по администрированию в ее новом отделе заполняет новую форму найма в интранете Microsoft, чтобы запросить офисную мебель и компьютер с программным обеспечением, электронную почту и голосовую почту, чтобы быть готовым для Шарон. Та же форма гарантирует, что имя Шарон будет добавлено в список телефонов компании, и что она получит табличку для двери своего офиса и почтовый ящик в почтовом отделении здания.\n\nКогда она приезжает, Шэрон выходит в интернет, чтобы прочитать руководство для сотрудников (сейчас его нет на бумаге), и она загружает любое программное обеспечение, которое ей нужно. Затем Шарон использует программу под названием MS Market для заказа канцелярских принадлежностей, книг, доски и визитных карточек. Мисс Маркет автоматически вписывает в заказ свое имя, адрес электронной почты и имя менеджера. Поставщики получают ее запрос по электронной почте и доставляют материалы в ее офис. Заказ, превышающий определенную сумму денег, будет автоматически отправлен менеджеру, прежде чем он отправится поставщику.\n\nЗарплата Шарон поступает на ее счет по электронной почте, и если она хочет, то может поменять свой банк онлайн. Для путешествий Шарон использует программу, разработанную Microsoft в партнерстве с American Express, под названием AXI. Он доступен в интернете двадцать четыре часа в сутки, семь дней в неделю.\n\nНекоторые люди думают, что у\" Микрософтов \" нет жизни вне компании, но на самом деле это так. Шэрон выходит замуж и отправляется в отпуск со своим новым мужем. Она вводит свое отпускное время онлайн. Когда они с мужем переезжают в новый дом, Шарон вводит свой новый адрес в интернете один раз, и он автоматически отправляется в каждый отдел, которому нужен ее адрес. Она посещает наш интранет, чтобы получить информацию о автобусных маршрутах и совместном использовании поездок в своем новом районе.\n\nКогда у Шарон и ее мужа рождается ребенок, она выходит в интернет, чтобы узнать о семинарах для родителей, оплачиваемом отпуске для родителей и дневном уходе за детьми. Microsoft платит определенную сумму в виде льгот каждому сотруднику компании, и они могут воспользоваться этими преимуществами многими способами. Они могут посмотреть на различные способы объединения преимуществ в интернете. Она также может покупать и продавать акции онлайн, используя компанию, которая покупает и продает акции для всех, кто работает в Microsoft, Saloman Smith Barney. Шарон может покупать и продавать акции Microsoft и использовать свой голос в качестве акционера онлайн.\n\nИспользование нашей компьютерной сети для замены бумажных бланков дало нам впечатляющие результаты. Пока я пишу эту книгу, мы сократили количество бумажных бланков с более чем 1000 до шестидесяти. В целом экономия от использования электронных форм составила не менее 40 миллионов долларов за первые двенадцать месяцев использования в 1997-8 годах. Наибольшая экономия была получена за счет снижения затрат на переработку. Бухгалтерские фирмы оценивают стоимость каждого бумажного заказа-в основном время всех людей, обрабатывающих бумагу, - примерно в 145 долларов. Электронная обработка в Microsoft стоит менее 5 долларов за заказ.\n\nПо мере того как мы изобретали новые решения, наш центральный бюджет информационных технологий, который охватывает эти и другие основные сферы бизнеса, сократился на 3 процента в период с 1996 по 1999 год, в основном из-за стандартизации данных и сокращения количества информационных систем, которыми мы располагаем.\n\nЭлектронные инструменты дают нам преимущества помимо снижения затрат. Например, наше программное обеспечение Microsoft Market запрашивает полномочия, прежде чем обработать запрос. Это предотвращает неуместные покупки, которые могут легко пройти через бумажную систему. Информация о доставке печатается на машинке, а не пишется от руки, поэтому почти ничего не отправляется в неправильное место назначения. Связь с нашими поставщиками документирована, и мы заранее знаем затраты, так что никаких сюрпризов нет. Нашим поставщикам платят быстрее, а это значит, что они хотят доставить товар быстро. Мы всегда открываем для себя новые преимущества.\n\nПереход от бумажных форм к электронным является важным шагом в развитии нервной системы современной организации, но вы должны использовать это изменение для улучшения процессов, которые являются центральными для вашего бизнеса. Цифровую нервную систему легко построить. Хорошая сеть, хорошая система электронной почты и простые в построении веб-страницы-это все, что вам нужно для избавления от внутренних бумажных форм. Наши внутренние инструменты преследуют две цели: использовать программное обеспечение для решения рутинных задач, чтобы наши работники умственного труда не тратили время и энергию; и освободить людей для выполнения более сложной работы и решения необычных ситуаций. Наши внутренние разработчики используют правило\" сорт-вареное яйцо\": пользователь должен иметь возможность входить и выходить из большинства административных инструментов в течение трех минут. Это гарантирует, что мы не создаем неуклюжие инструменты и не вызываем больше работы в целом.\n\nСовершенствование административных и внутренних бизнес-процессов является важным способом повышения общей эффективности работы ваших сотрудников. Когда вы даете работникам умственного труда хорошие внутренние инструменты, вы также посылаете им важное сообщение: когда сотрудники видят, что компания повышает эффективность и избавляется от рутинных административных задач, отнимающих много времени, они знают, что компания ценит их время и хочет, чтобы они использовали его с пользой.\n\nЭто легко измерить, когда вы делаете своих заводских рабочих более эффективными. Трудно измерить, когда вы делаете своих работников умственного труда более эффективными, но вполне логично, что работники, которые не обременены рутинными задачами, будут работать лучше. Преимущество для клиентов заключается в том, что ваши сотрудники тратят меньше времени на бумажную работу и больше времени на потребности клиентов.\n\nГлава вторая.\n\nКоммерция: Интернет.\n\nВсе Меняется.\n\nОседлай ракету перемен.\n\nНе так давно я выступал перед советом директоров одного немецкого финансового учреждения. Это были опытные бизнесмены. Самому молодому из них было, вероятно, пятьдесят пять, и многим из них было за шестьдесят. Они видели много изменений в банковском деле и пережили много технологических изменений. Однако банк еще не начал использовать новые интернет-технологии.\n\nВ день моего визита они услышали серию разговоров от сотрудников Microsoft о компании. Когда я вошел в комнату, все они сидели там, скрестив руки на груди, и выглядели несчастными.\n\n- Ладно, - сказал я. В чем проблема\"?\n\nОдин из них ответил: \"Мы думаем, что банковское дело находится в процессе полного изменения, и мы получаем технические переговоры от людей здесь, в Microsoft - более технические, чем мы привыкли\". Он снял очки, протер глаза и сказал: \"Это, наверное, хорошо, хотя и утомляет\". Помолчав, он продолжил: \"Это хорошо, что вы просто собираетесь сделать все ваши продукты лучше, но каков общий план? Чтобы рассматривать вас как долгосрочного поставщика, нам нужно, чтобы вы дали нам видение будущего. Каковы ваши организационные принципы развития\"?\n\nСтарший руководитель Microsoft, который заканчивает встречу с клиентами, обычно не приносит подготовленную речь. Вместо этого человек отвечает на вопросы и делает резюме того, что мы будем делать в ответ на любые важные вопросы, которые возникли. Поэтому, стоя перед немецкими банкирами, я думал: \"о боже. Мы провели восемь часов, разговаривая с этим банком, и не ответили на основные вопросы клиента. Теперь мне придется делать это без записок\"...\n\nНо к тому времени я уже пару десятков раз выступал с докладом о цифровой нервной системе и работал над этой книгой почти год. Поэтому я начал записывать основные изменения, которые, как я думал, произойдут с технологией в ближайшем будущем. Я записал десять изменений, которые, как я думал, окажут значительное влияние на отрасли, сказал я банкирам. Это были важные изменения в поведении клиентов, которые были связаны с цифровыми технологиями и происходили сейчас.\n\n-Я хочу спросить вас, верите ли вы, что каждый из них произойдет. Не беспокойтесь сейчас о том, как быстро, просто скажите мне, верите ли вы, что они когда-нибудь произойдут. Если вы не верите, что они будут, то вы не должны менять то, что вы делаете с технологией. Но если вы верите, что они произойдут, и это только вопрос времени, то вы должны начать готовиться к этим изменениям уже сегодня\".\n\n\"Вы верите, что в будущем люди на работе будут использовать компьютеры каждый день для большинства своих рабочих мест?\" - Спросил я. \"Сегодня многие люди используют компьютеры время от времени, но многие работники умственного труда могут использовать свои компьютеры только несколько раз в день. Они могут даже пару дней обходиться без использования ПК. Верите ли вы, что сегодняшняя бумажная работа будет заменена более эффективными цифровыми процессами\"? Они так и сделали.\n\n- Ты веришь, что когда-нибудь в большинстве домов появятся компьютеры? В Соединенных Штатах сегодня около половины всех домов имеют компьютеры. В некоторых странах этот процент немного выше, но в большинстве других он значительно ниже. Вы верите, - спросил я, - что в один прекрасный день компьютеры будут так же распространены в домах, как телефоны или телевизоры? Они так и сделали.\n\n\"Верите ли вы, что когда-нибудь большинство предприятий и большинство домов будут иметь высокоскоростное подключение к всемирной паутине?\" - Спросил я. Они согласно кивнули.\n\n\"Вы верите, что электронная почта станет таким же распространенным способом общения между людьми в бизнесе и дома, как телефон или бумажная почта сегодня?\n\nСегодня не все пользуются электронной почтой, даже если у них есть компьютер. Изменится ли эта ситуация\"? Они согласились, что так и будет.\n\n- Итак, если большинство людей имеют компьютеры и пользуются ими каждый день, - спросил я, - вы верите, что большая часть информации начнет поступать в цифровом виде? Как вы думаете, ваши счета будут поступать в электронном виде? Как вы думаете, вы будете заказывать свои поездки через Интернет?\" Они согласились, что эти перемены грядут.\n\n\"Как вы думаете, цифровое оборудование станет обычным?\" - Спросил я. \"Вы думаете, что все телефоны, камеры, видео и телевизоры скоро станут цифровыми? Как вы думаете, появятся ли в доме другие новые машины и будут ли они подключены к сети?\" Они согласились, что это лишь вопрос времени.\n\n\"Видите ли вы, что придет время, когда ноутбуки станут компьютерными ноутбуками\"? Я описал, что имел в виду: компьютерный Блокнот-это новая машина, которая позволяет вам делать заметки, как вы делаете это сегодня на бумаге, и позволяет вам носить с собой все личные и профессиональные данные, которые вам нужны. Вероятно,это будет последнее изменение. \"Самое замечательное в компьютерном ноутбуке, - сказал я, - это то, что сколько бы вы в него ни вкладывали, он не становится больше или тяжелее\". Они рассмеялись. После тридцатисекундного разговора по-немецки один из них сказал:\"Мы подумали, что вы сказали что-то смешное, а потом поняли, что вы сказали что-то важное\".\n\n\"Я зря трачу ваше время\"? - Спросил я. - Ты веришь, что эти перемены когда-нибудь произойдут? К этому времени мы уже начали разговаривать. Они коротко переговорили между собой по-немецки. Банкир, который говорил до этого, сказал: \"Мы говорили о том же самом дома, и да, мы верим, что это произойдет. Когда это произойдет, это полностью изменит природу банковского дела\".\n\n-Как ты думаешь, когда это произойдет? - Спросил я. У них был другой, долгий разговор на немецком языке. Затем они сказали: \"Мы не ожидали, что примем это решение здесь, но мы приняли. Мы собирались рассказать вам о двадцати годах, но потом решили, что в течение десяти лет эти изменения либо наступят, либо станут очень скоро. Банковское дело будет совершенно другим\".\n\n\"Чтобы подготовиться к этим изменениям, - сказал я им, - вам нужно сделать цифровой поток информации повсюду в вашей организации\". Я вкратце рассказал о необходимости использования цифровых инструментов, которые они уже имели для своих работников умственного труда. Я говорил о цифровом соединении их систем знаний с бизнес-информационными системами для создания новой инфраструктуры вокруг ПК и интернет-технологий. Если они сделают это, сказал я им, они будут готовы к трем основным изменениям в бизнесе, которые произойдут в результате всех технологических достижений:\n\n1: большая часть контактов между бизнесом и клиентами, бизнесом и бизнесом, людьми и правительством станет цифровой и самообслуживаемой.\n\n2: обслуживание клиентов станет основным способом повышения ценности в каждом бизнесе. Участие человека в обслуживании будет смещаться от рутинных, малоценных задач к высокоценному личному обслуживанию клиента.\n\n3: скорость цифровых операций и потребность в более личном внимании к клиентам побудят компании внедрять цифровые процессы внутри компании, если они еще не внедрили их по соображениям эффективности. Компании будут использовать цифровую нервную систему для регулярной адаптации своих внутренних бизнес-процессов к среде, которая постоянно меняется из-за потребностей клиентов и конкуренции.\n\nСложные проблемы обслуживания клиентов и бизнеса потребуют мощных компьютеров с обеих сторон отношений-клиента и сотрудника,-сказал я. Новым отношениям будут способствовать различные электронные средства, такие как голос, видео и Интерактивное использование одного и того же экрана компьютера. Мы увидим мир, в котором довольно простые персональные компьютеры-компаньоны стали обычным явлением наряду с чрезвычайно мощными универсальными компьютерами, поддерживающими интеллектуальную работу дома или в офисе.\n\n\"Видение Microsoft, - закончил Я, - состоит в том, чтобы предоставить программное обеспечение, которое связывает все эти цифровые машины вместе и позволяет людям создавать цифровые решения, основанные на веб-образе жизни. Все очень просто\".\n\nУ правления немецкого банка был для меня последний вопрос, который волнует всех: что они должны сделать лично, чтобы подготовиться к этому новому цифровому миру? Мой ответ был таков: используйте инструменты сами. Высшие руководители должны использовать электронную почту и другие электронные инструменты, чтобы ознакомиться с новым способом ведения дел.\n\nОни должны видеть, как выглядят интернет-сайты их конкурентов. Они должны стать пользователями Интернета. Купите несколько книг и организуйте путешествие по Интернету, сказал я им, и посмотрите, на что это похоже. Если вы собираетесь возглавить цифровую эру, вам нужно достаточно хорошо познакомиться с Интернетом, чтобы иметь возможность представить, что веб-образ жизни будет означать для вашей отрасли-даже если изменение займет годы.\n\nВ течение многих лет энтузиасты говорили, что интернет появится \"завтра\". Вы будете продолжать читать предсказания о том, что большие перемены произойдут в ближайшие двенадцать месяцев. Это просто мусор. Социальные изменения, которые должны произойти, занимают годы, и инфраструктура должна быть расширена. Но когда социальные и технические изменения достигнут определенной точки, изменения будут быстрыми и постоянными. Наступит момент, когда веб-стиль жизни действительно взлетит, и я думаю, что это произойдет в ближайшие пять лет. Как я уже говорил, мы всегда переоцениваем изменения, которые произойдут в ближайшие два года, и недооцениваем изменения, которые произойдут в ближайшие десять. Не позволяйте себя одурачить и заставить ничего не делать.\n\nТрудно представить себе бизнес-категорию, в которой Интернет не будет иметь эффекта или в которой уже нет новых интернет-компаний. Многие фирмы сейчас мечтают стать первым интернет - книжным магазином или туристическим агентством, завоевав первых клиентов, общественный энтузиазм, известное имя.\n\nИнтернет-компании не просто изучают новые способы ведения бизнеса. Они также спешат сломать барьеры между различными сферами бизнеса. Amazon.com, которая начинала как интернет-книготорговец, начала продавать компакт-диски. У Amazon нет причин не продавать и другие продукты. Первоначальная причина выхода вашей компании в Интернет может заключаться в том, чтобы получить экономию средств и привлечь новых клиентов. Когда у вас есть клиенты, взаимодействующие с вами, у вас есть удивительная способность строить эти отношения, чтобы предложить более широкий набор продуктов.\n\nИнтернет-бизнес не похож на отделение банка, где можно обучить сотрудников лишь небольшому количеству продуктов. Виртуальная природа интернета позволяет делать любые покупки, которые хотят делать ваши клиенты. Вы увидите больше компаний, таких как Amazon, которые сильны в одной онлайн-области, а затем расширяют свои продуктовые предложения. Предостережение для каждого бизнеса состоит в том, что даже если никто в вашей отрасли не вскочит рано, крупные онлайн-компании, пытающиеся охватить каждую коммерческую область, перейдут в вашу.\n\nУзнайте об Интернете сегодня. Найдите некоторых из ваших клиентов, которые уже принимают веб-стиль жизни. Используйте эту группу для разработки моделей ведения бизнеса в целом. Не пройдет и десяти лет, как большинство ваших клиентов сменят вас, и вы будете готовы.\n\nПосредник должен добавить ценность\n\nЗдесь, в начале двадцать первого века, основным новым правилом бизнеса является то, что интернет меняет все. Интернет-технологии меняют то, как каждая компания, даже небольшая, имеет дело со своими сотрудниками, партнерами и поставщиками.\n\nНе каждая компания должна использовать Интернет для взаимодействия со своими клиентами прямо сейчас, но вскоре веб-сайт компании, где клиенты могут вести бизнес с фирмой, станет таким же важным, как телефон и почтовый адрес. У подавляющего большинства компаний из списка Fortune 500 уже есть веб-сайты. Интернет сокращает издержки и меняет отношения компаний со своими клиентами. Интернет создает большую конкуренцию среди продавцов и помогает продавцам найти возможных покупателей.\n\nВ доинтернетовские времена покупатели могли получать товары от большинства производителей только через посреднические структуры.\n\nСегодня клиенты могут вести бизнес непосредственно с производителями, стремящимися предложить интернет-услуги. Сегодня любой производитель может предоставить интернет-версию Заводского магазина.\n\nДо появления Интернета сбор всей информации о финансовых услугах, вариантах путешествий и других продуктах требовал много времени. Огромное количество сервисных компаний зарабатывали свои деньги, собирая и организуя такого рода информацию для клиентов. Сегодня, несмотря на несовершенные инструменты поиска, клиенты могут выйти в Интернет, чтобы найти гораздо больше нужной им информации. И любая компания может предоставить ценную информацию дешево в интернете, без филиалов.\n\nВ 1995 году в книге \"Дорога вперед\" я описал, как Интернет помогает создать идеальный рынок Адама Смита, на котором покупатели и продавцы могут легко найти друг друга, не тратя много времени и денег. Первая проблема на большинстве рынков-найти кого-то, с кем можно вести бизнес. Вторая проблема-это понимание природы и качества предлагаемых товаров и услуг. Интернет позволяет покупателю легко получить справочную информацию о товаре и легко сравнить цены. Покупатели также могут рассказать продавцам больше о том, что им нужно, и продавцы смогут ориентировать свои товары на людей, которые больше всего в них заинтересованы, и продавать сопутствующие товары.\n\nИнтернет-это отличный инструмент, помогающий клиентам найти лучшее предложение. Покупателям довольно легко переходить с одного сайта на другой, чтобы найти лучшие цены на некоторые товары. По крайней мере, две различные службы обеспечивают сравнение цен для клиентов, покупающих такие товары, как книги и компакт-диски. На некоторых туристических сайтах есть автоматические поисковики выгодных предложений, которые могут найти низкие тарифы на авиабилеты. По крайней мере, одна компания, Priceline.com, меняет отношения между покупателем и продавцом, предлагая покупателям цену, которую они готовы заплатить за автомобиль или билет на самолет, и предлагая эту цену различным продавцам. Пока неясно, насколько широко будет использоваться этот подход, но это возможно только через Интернет.\n\nСо временем программное обеспечение будет автоматизировать сравнение цен еще больше, пока они не станут легко электронными. По крайней мере, один интернет-магазин уже проверяет другие крупные сайты на предмет цен на часто покупаемые товары и автоматически снижает свои цены, чтобы убедиться, что они всегда немного ниже. Без магазинов, за которые нужно платить, продавец все равно может получить прибыль. Клиенты смогут объединиться в электронном виде, чтобы получить более низкие цены способами, которые раньше были непростыми. Будут даже случаи, когда программное обеспечение, представляющее продавца, ведет переговоры с программным обеспечением, представляющим сотни или тысячи клиентов.\n\nДля большинства продуктов, которые доступны во многих магазинах, клиенты получат наибольшую выгоду. Для уникальных товаров и услуг продавцы найдут больше потенциальных клиентов и могут взимать более высокие цены. Чем больше клиентов принимают веб-стиль жизни, тем ближе экономика будет двигаться к идеальному рынку Адама Смита во всех областях торговли.\n\nТеперь клиенты могут напрямую обращаться к производителям и поставщикам услуг, поэтому простая передача товаров или информации приносит мало пользы. Разные люди предсказывали \"смерть посредника\". Конечно, ценность некоторых видов посредников быстро падает до нуля. Турагенты, которые просто бронируют авиабилеты, исчезнут. Этот вид крупномасштабной, малоценной сделки идеально подходит для сайта путешествий в интернете с самообслуживанием. В будущем турагентам придется делать больше, чем просто заказывать билеты; им нужно будет создать полное приключение путешествия. Турагент, который предоставляет высоко персонализированные туры в Италию или калифорнийскую винодельческую страну, по-прежнему будет пользоваться большим спросом.\n\nЕсли вы являетесь посредником, интернет-обещание более дешевых цен и более быстрого обслуживания может положить конец вашей роли содействия контакту между производителем и потребителем. Если это происходит с вами, один из вариантов-использовать Интернет, чтобы вернуться в действие. Это то, что Egghead, крупная сеть магазинов программного обеспечения, сделала после нескольких лет борьбы. Egghead закрыл все свои физические магазины в 1998 году и начал продавать только в Интернете. Egghead теперь предлагает ряд новых онлайн-программ, которые используют преимущества Интернета, таких как электронные продажи примерно пятидесяти различных категорий оборудования и программного обеспечения, а также подержанных компьютеров. Пока неясно, удастся ли Яйцеголовому пройти тест, описанный в этой главе, который заключается в том, что посредник должен увеличивать стоимость, но компания, безусловно, понимает этот принцип.\n\nКаждый магазин должен учитывать интернет. Успех проекта Amazon.com книжный магазин, который существует только в интернете, заставил Barnes & Noble объединить свои успешные физические книжные магазины с сильным онлайн-присутствием и начать работать с Bertelsmann, ведущей международной медиа-компанией.\n\nДля сферы услуг Интернет требует, чтобы Вы были либо крупным, недорогим поставщиком, либо поставщиком высоко персонализированных услуг. Для модели с большим объемом и низкой стоимостью вы используете интернет-технологию для создания подхода самообслуживания. Вы делаете много информации доступной для клиентов, и вы управляете большим трафиком через ваш интернет-сайт, предлагая лучшую цену. Поскольку только несколько компаний на любом рынке будут крупными игроками, большинству компаний придется искать способы использования Интернета не только для снижения затрат, но и для предоставления новых услуг.\n\nЭлектронная торговля ценными бумагами начала предоставлять недорогие финансовые услуги в Интернете в 1992 году. К 1998 году по меньшей мере семьдесят компаний покупали и продавали акции для своих клиентов в интернете, и это число росло. Финансовые фирмы, которые все еще предлагают услугу лицом к лицу или по телефону, сталкиваются с проблемой: большая часть данных об акциях, которые эти компании предоставляют своим клиентам, доступна бесплатно в Интернете. Но если компании, которые не предлагают интернет-услуги, становятся электронными трейдерами( e-traders), что они могут сделать, что отличается от того, что уже предлагают клиентам?\n\nMerrill Lynch, ведущая на рынке финансовая компания, задавала себе именно этот вопрос, когда смотрела на то, как она вела бизнес в 1997 году. Клиенты инвестируют в Merrill Lynch уже более ста лет. Компания управляла своими акциями, получая большие объемы финансовых данных, анализируя их и составляя долгосрочные финансовые планы. К 1997 году клиенты вложили в Merrill Lynch более одного триллиона долларов. Но рост дешевой торговли, а затем интернет-торговли между 1992 и 1997 годами показал менеджерам, что компании придется меняться. Как сказал Говард Сорген из Merrill Lynch :\" наши клиенты менялись. Менялся способ получения информации и принятия решений. Было бы глупо думать, что нам тоже не придется меняться\".\n\nОсновными активами Merrill Lynch являются ее финансовые консультанты, люди, которые консультируют клиентов по поводу их инвестиций. Но в 1997 году они тратили много времени на поиск данных и недостаточно времени на консультирование клиентов по поводу их инвестиций. Информационные системы в то время были дорогими и трудными в использовании. Все различные категории данных-цены акций, информация о продукте, база данных клиентов, цены - находились в разных системах, и все они были несовместимы и трудны в использовании. Новая информационная система была построена вокруг финансовых консультантов. Это помогло им получить данные и разработать лучший финансовый план для клиента как можно быстрее. Чтобы сэкономить деньги и время на разработку, компания также хотела использовать существующие продукты, когда это было возможно.\n\nМенеджеры Merrill Lynch попросили у своего совета директоров миллиард долларов для инвестиций в новые технологии. Совет директоров согласился с тем, что лучший способ конкурировать - предоставить работникам умственного труда компании-финансовым консультантам-лучшие инструменты знаний. Таким образом, менеджеры получили разрешение на то, что стало пятилетним проектом стоимостью 825 миллионов долларов. Эта работа была завершена в срок в октябре 1998 года и обошлась почти в 825 миллионов долларов. Из этой суммы около 250 миллионов долларов ушло на разработку программного обеспечения. Большая часть оставшихся расходов - например, система получения цен на акции и рыночных новостей - потребовалась бы независимо от того, какое программное обеспечение использовала Merrill Lynch. Фактическая разница в стоимости составила около 250 миллионов долларов за четыре года. За чуть более 60 миллионов долларов в год, примерно 3500 долларов на одного финансового консультанта, Merrill Lynch улучшила информационную систему для 14 700 финансовых консультантов в своих 700 американских офисах и еще для 2000 консультантов на международном уровне.\n\nГлавный технический директор Говард Зорген показал мне решение Merrill Lynch. Все системы теперь полностью совместимы. Вся финансовая информация, из любого источника, организована в \"страницы\", а затем в\"книги\". Финансовый консультант может заглянуть в любую книгу-например, в котировки акций на бирже NASDAQ, в Нью-Йорке и Токио. Финансовый консультант может сразу увидеть, все ли акции клиента идут хорошо или плохо и почему. Раньше это занимало много времени, так как акции каждой компании рассматривались индивидуально. Теперь финансовый консультант может даже сразу увидеть, что произойдет, если одна партия акций будет куплена, а другая продана. Вскоре клиенты смогут увидеть эти расчеты на своих экранах ПК. Кроме того, система ведет себя как хорошо обученный помощник финансового контролера. Если у клиента контролера есть акции компании, система будет выводить фоновые данные о компании на экран без запроса, всякий раз, когда контролер запрашивает цену акций.\n\nПосле изменений в системе Merrill Lynch у финансовых консультантов появилось больше времени для построения более прочных отношений с клиентами. Затем Merrill Lynch решила, что предоставление клиентам большего количества информации сделает их отношения более прочными, а не более слабыми.\n\nMerrill Lynch Online - это версия системы Merrill Lynch для клиентов. Он дает клиенту некоторые исходные данные, на которых основываются решения, а также основную информацию о счете клиента в Merrill Lynch. Компания надеялась получить 200 000 клиентов в первый год, в среднем около 550 человек в день. Вместо этого от 700 до 800 человек в день выходили в интернет с помощью этой системы. Одним из сюрпризов стал возраст клиентов, которые первыми приняли систему. Merrill Lynch полагала, что молодые клиенты, выросшие с Интернетом, сначала попробуют эту систему, но первыми покупателями были более пожилые и богатые клиенты.\n\nПосле первого успеха Merrill Lynch добавила еще больше в онлайн-сервис. Сегодня клиенты могут отправлять электронные письма своим финансовым консультантам, просматривать последние цены акций, покупать и продавать акции. Merrill Lynch теперь видит в Интернете возможность, а не угрозу. Он дает клиенту информацию, но финансовая информация не является финансовым знанием. Это все еще обеспечивается финансовыми консультантами, у которых теперь есть больше времени, чтобы сосредоточиться на этом. И они предоставляют его хорошо информированным клиентам, которые задают лучшие вопросы, чем плохо информированные клиенты. Теперь цель состоит в том, чтобы клиент и финансовый консультант одновременно смотрели на одни и те же данные на экране. Затем, как любят говорить люди из Merrill Lynch,\"начинается настоящее волшебство\".\n\nВзаимодействовать со своими клиентами.\n\nПо мере роста электронной коммерции не только посредники будут находить творческие способы использования Интернета для укрепления своих отношений с клиентами. Компании, которые относятся к электронной коммерции как к чему-то большему, чем просто способ заработать легкие деньги, сделают это лучше всего. Конечно, продажи-это конечная цель, но сама продажа-это только одна часть онлайн-взаимодействия с клиентами. Некоторые компании будут использовать Интернет для взаимодействия со своими клиентами таким образом, который раньше был невозможен. Они сделают продажу частью серии услуг для клиентов, для которых Интернет обладает уникальными преимуществами.\n\nВажно, чтобы клиенты уходили от электронных взаимодействий достаточно довольными, чтобы рассказать об этом своим друзьям. Это самое мощное средство, с помощью которого любой продукт или компания строит репутацию, а интернет-это средство, созданное для легкого общения. Если клиенту не нравится товар или то, как с ним обошелся трейдер, он, скорее всего, отправит электронное письмо всем своим друзьям. Интернет-автомобильный сайт под названием Autoweb.com запрашивает клиентов о дилерском обслуживании по электронной почте и удаляет дилеров из своих списков, если они не улучшают свой сервис в результате жалоб.\n\nСегодня основной конкуренцией для интернет-магазинов являются физические магазины. Физические магазины имеют гораздо более высокие объемы продаж, чем интернет-магазины. Онлайн-продажи в 1998 году составляли всего 0,5% от общего объема продаж в семи крупнейших экономиках мира. Но в следующем десятилетии этот процент значительно возрастет. По мере развития электронной коммерции основной конкуренцией за интернет-сайты будут уже не физические магазины, а другие интернет-магазины.\n\nБыстро растущие категории онлайн-торговли включают финансы и страхование, путешествия и продажи компьютеров. Такие компании, как Cisco Systems, Dell Computer и Microsoft, в настоящее время делают миллиарды долларов каждый в бизнесе через Интернет каждый год. Chrysler ожидает, что ее 1,5-процентный объем онлайн-продаж подскочит до 25 процентов через четыре года. Даже самые осторожные оценки прогнозируют ежегодный рост онлайн-продаж примерно на 45 процентов. По самым высоким оценкам, к 2000 году объем бизнеса превысил 1,6 триллиона долларов. Я думаю, что это слишком низко.\n\nDell была одной из первых крупных компаний, которые перешли на электронную коммерцию. Компания поставляет компьютеры по всему миру, продавая продукцию на сумму более 18 миллиардов долларов. Компания начала продавать свою продукцию онлайн в середине 1996 года. Его онлайн-бизнес быстро вырос с $1 млн в неделю до $ 1 млн в день. Вскоре он подскочил до 3 миллионов долларов в день, а затем и до 5 миллионов. Он все еще растет. Покупателям компьютеров явно нравится и легко покупать свои компьютеры в Интернете. На момент написания этой статьи Dell посещает свой веб-сайт более 1,5 миллиона раз в неделю, и 11 процентов ее бизнеса находится в интернете. Dell надеялась, что этот показатель вырастет до 50%, возможно, уже в 2000 году.\n\nМайкл Делл, основавший компанию, верит в Прямые продажи и компьютерную коммерцию. Но он знает, что Интернет должен быть основной частью общей бизнес-стратегии. Весь бизнес Dell основан на онлайн-торговле и поддержке. Первый сайт Dell предоставлял информацию о продукте, позволял клиентам покупать онлайн и запрашивал идеи клиентов. Делл многому научился из поступавших предложений, в основном в интернете. Со временем Dell внесла сотни изменений в свой веб-сайт. Клиенты могут делать все больше и больше онлайн. Теперь они могут видеть онлайн прогресс продукта, который они заказали.\n\n\"Интернет не заменяет людей. Это делает их более эффективными\", - говорит Майкл Делл. \"Мы должны были построить интернет-систему, которая была бы настолько удобна, что клиенты получали больше пользы за свое время, чем по телефону\".\n\nНаличие дополнительной информации в интернете для клиентов не уменьшило ценность отдела продаж Dell. Как и Merrill Lynch, Dell обнаружила, что образованный клиент-лучший клиент. Отдел продаж Dell стал больше похож на консультантов для клиента. И у них есть больше времени для консультаций, потому что покупка и продажа онлайн намного быстрее.\n\nОдним из уникальных подходов Dell к поддержке клиентов было создание более 5000 индивидуально разработанных страниц для своих крупных клиентов. Около 65 процентов онлайн-бизнеса Dell приходится на частных лиц и малый бизнес, и главные страницы-это один из способов развития корпоративного бизнеса Dell. Они делают крупные покупки в интернете проще и быстрее.\n\nТолько информационные технологии (ИТ) могут уравновесить потребность в достаточном количестве запасов для быстрого снабжения клиентов с затратами на хранение слишком большого количества запасов. Идеальная информация о том, что нужно клиенту, - это ответ на потребность в нулевом запасе, ожидающем заказа.\n\nMarriott International, крупнейшая в мире Гостиничная компания, зарабатывает более 10 миллиардов долларов на своих 1500 отелях по всему миру под десятью различными брендами. Отели имеют систему онлайн-бронирования с 1996 года, и хотя Marriott говорит, что эта система была простой и всего лишь экспериментом, к концу года она принесла бизнесу 1 миллион долларов.\n\nМарриотт увидел, что Интернет может сделать еще больше, и в начале 1997 года они создали специальную интернет-команду. С самого начала технологическая команда тесно сотрудничала с бизнес-командой. Исследования показали, что одним из предметов, о которых люди больше всего хотели получить информацию, были путешествия. \"Интернет - это сервис, - говорит Майк Пусатери из Marriott, - предоставляющий клиентам услуги быстрее, дружелюбнее и более личные, чем они или компания когда-либо испытывали раньше. А обслуживание-это бизнес Марриотта\".\n\nMarriott была одной из первых компаний, создавших интерактивную домашнюю страницу на своем веб-сайте. Вы можете найти отель Marriott в интернете, запросив отели в определенном городе, отели с определенными удобствами и отели с определенными функциями в своих номерах. Связанные страницы показывают достопримечательности рядом с отелем, например поле для гольфа. Или, если вы хотите пойти в китайский ресторан, система перечислит шесть ближайших. Когда вы выберете свой отель, вы сможете узнать о ценах и забронировать номер. Есть также ссылки на другие сайты, которые бронируют номера, например TravelWeb.com и Microsoft Expedia.com. Сайт Marriott содержит ссылки на 1000 других веб-страниц.\n\nПоскольку каждый посетитель ищет именно то, что он или она хочет на веб-сайте Marriott, у каждого посетителя есть свой опыт. Веб-сайт посещают 15 000 человек в день, что принесло более 2 миллионов долларов в месяц из интернет-источников в 1997 году. Марриотту трудно сказать, какой процент от этой прибыли был бы получен в любом случае традиционными методами, но ясно, что интернет привлекает более богатых клиентов, которые предпочитают его более дорогие отели. В среднем онлайн-клиент тратит в Marriott больше, чем средний клиент.\n\nМарриотт обнаружил, как и другие, что чем более интерактивным является сайт, тем больше деловой активности он получает от своих посетителей. Например, вместо поэтажных планов будущие клиенты видят виртуальные фотографии отеля. Вскоре клиенты смогут ввести место, где они хотят остановиться, и названия других отелей Marriott, в которых они останавливались. Затем сайт предоставит им ближайший отель Marriott, похожий на тот, которым они пользовались раньше.\n\nМарриотт не вырезает посредников, он делает их частью своего обслуживания клиентов. Компания предоставляет специальные места на своем сайте для турагентов и организаторов встреч. Тысячи планировщиков встреч просматривают сайт Marriott, потому что им не нужно посещать отель, прежде чем они примут решение о том, где провести свою встречу.\n\nПримите веб-образ жизни.\n\nЕсли бы вы спросили своих друзей, почему они используют телефон для общения со своими друзьями или почему они обращаются к телевизору для развлечения или последних новостей, они посмотрели бы на вас странным образом. Если бы вы спросили своих друзей, приняли ли они \"электрический образ жизни\", они бы подумали, что вы сошли с ума.\n\nЛюди в развитых странах мало думают о своих электрических продуктах, мы просто используем их. Но люди, которым сейчас за пятьдесят, помнят времена, когда телевизоры были только в нескольких семьях. Наши бабушки и дедушки помнят времена, когда большая часть сельской Америки была без электричества. Потребовалось более ста лет, чтобы электрический образ жизни произвел революцию в цивилизации.\n\nКогда улицы и дома были впервые подключены, электричество использовалось только для освещения. Способность электричества изменить образ жизни каждого была скрыта. Электрический свет был чище, безопаснее, ярче и удобнее, чем природный газ, масло или свечи. Однако, когда была создана инфраструктура, появились новые продукты, которые использовали преимущества электричества. Электрические холодильники, проигрыватели пластинок и кондиционеры применяли новую технологию к существующим потребностям. Самыми революционными видами использования электричества были телефон, радио и телевизор. Эти новые машины изменили нашу экономику и наш образ жизни. Люди и не мечтали об этих продуктах до того, как появилась инфраструктура.\n\nПоскольку интернет - это коммуникационная инфраструктура, которая зависит от электричества, можно сказать, что его популярное признание является продолжением образа жизни электричества. Но интернет создает новый образ жизни, который я называю \"веб-стилем жизни\". Веб-образ жизни, как и образ жизни электричества, будет характеризоваться тем, что новые вещи происходят быстро. Инфраструктура высокоскоростных коммуникаций создает новое программное и аппаратное обеспечение, которое изменит жизнь людей.\n\nИнтеллектуальные машины, такие как ПК, становятся все более мощными и менее дорогими. Поскольку они программируются, их можно использовать для многих различных задач. Через десять лет большинство американцев и многие другие люди во всем мире будут жить в Интернете. Для этих людей будет естественно обратиться к Интернету, чтобы получать новости, учиться, развлекаться и общаться. Это будет так же нормально, как поднять трубку телефона, чтобы поговорить с кем-то или заказать что-то. Интернет будет использоваться для оплаты ваших счетов, управления финансами, общения с вашим врачом и ведения любого бизнеса. Так же естественно, что вы будете носить с собой одну или несколько небольших машин, использующих радиосвязь, чтобы постоянно оставаться на связи и заниматься электронными делами, где бы вы ни находились.\n\nДля многих людей веб-стиль жизни сегодня очень близок. К 1998 году более шестидесяти миллионов американцев регулярно пользовались интернетом, по сравнению с двадцатью двумя миллионами годом ранее. К 1998 году средний пользователь заходил в интернет восемь-девять раз в месяц, проводя в общей сложности около трех с половиной часов в месяц в интернете. Интересно видеть, что люди, живущие веб-образом жизни, используют Интернет, чтобы учиться и покупать по-новому. Когда летом 1997 года \"Странник\" приземлился на Марсе, сайт НАСА за четыре дня получил сорок семь миллионов просмотров от людей, которые искали больше подробностей, чем они могли получить от традиционных средств массовой информации.\n\nКомпании предоставляют широкий спектр информации и услуг, таких как котировки акций в режиме реального времени, спортивные результаты и путеводители по городу. В интернете можно купить практически все, от картин до старых игрушек. Интернет является идеальным средством для оказания помощи, чтобы тоже создать сообщество,. Есть сайты для отслеживания пропавших детей, для помощи людям в усыновлении домашних животных и для любого времяпрепровождения, которое вы можете себе представить. Сайты, в которых участвуют граждане, получают отличный трафик.\n\nКультурное изменение, столь же значительное, как переход к веб-образу жизни, будет в некоторой степени зависеть от возраста пользователей. Дети, растущие с новой технологией, покажут нам все возможности. Широко распространены персональные компьютеры, высокоскоростные сети и интернет-коммуникации. Университеты избавляются от бумажных бланков и регистрируют студентов на занятия через Интернет. Студенты могут посмотреть свои оценки и даже отправить работу через Интернет. Учителя проводят онлайн-дискуссионные группы. Студенты пишут друзьям и родственникам по электронной почте так же естественно, как и звонят им по телефону.\n\nВнедрение технологий для веб-образа жизни происходит быстрее, чем внедрение электричества, автомобилей, телевидения и радио. Многие люди, которые используют ПК в офисе, устанавливают их дома для работы, а затем используют их для гораздо большего. Многие люди старше пятидесяти пяти лет, которые обычно не добавляют новые технологии в свой образ жизни, хотят использовать Интернет как способ оставаться на связи со своими друзьями и семьями. Революционно новое использование Интернета, которое никто из нас не может точно предсказать сегодня, изменит мир так же полностью в двадцать первом веке, как неожиданное использование электричества в двадцатом-и быстрее.\n\nПоскольку люди быстро перемещаются в интернете, одним из самых основных изменений будет степень, в которой клиенты будут управлять своими финансами в интернете. В 1998 году только около миллиона из пятнадцати миллиардов счетов в Соединенных Штатах были оплачены электронным способом. Онлайн-обслуживание клиентов было мало доступно. На самом деле, хотя клиенты могут оплачивать некоторые счета онлайн, почти в каждом случае они все равно получают их на бумаге. По оценкам Министерства торговли США, когда клиенты смогут платить онлайн, затраты на обработку данных снизятся более чем на 20 миллиардов долларов в год. Сегодня вы должны рассчитать на бумаге, какие счета вы хотите оплатить и сколько вы хотите заплатить по каждому. В будущем программное обеспечение позволит вам в режиме онлайн рассчитать влияние различных платежей на ваш банковский баланс. Вы сделаете свой платеж точно в срок. А программное обеспечение для оплаты счетов будет взаимодействовать с программным обеспечением для управления финансами.\n\nК концу 1998 года около половины всех американских домов имели компьютеры, и около половины из них были подключены к интернету. В большинстве других стран этот процент ниже. Снижение стоимости высокоскоростных коммуникаций, чтобы люди могли постоянно оставаться на связи, и упрощение использования программного обеспечения имеют важное значение для распространения веб-образа жизни. Я считаю, что к 2001 году более 60 процентов американских домов будут иметь компьютеры, и что 85 процентов этих домов будут подключены к интернету. Для того чтобы другие страны достигли такого уровня использования, им придется вложить значительные средства в инфраструктуру связи.\n\nЛюди не понимают, насколько улучшится аппаратное и программное обеспечение. Возьмем только один пример: экранная технология. Я пишу электронную почту на пятидесятисантиметровом плоском экране. Он пока не доступен по разумной цене, но через два-три года будет доступен. Через пять лет стосантиметровый плоский экран станет доступным. Качество экрана будет иметь большое влияние на то, как много люди будут читать на экране, а не на бумаге.\n\nСтоимость персонального компьютера также снижается. Исторически индустрия ПК концентрировалась на создании более мощных ПК по определенной цене. Теперь авансы снижают и цены. Способные ПК сегодня стоят гораздо меньше 1000 долларов, а более низкие цены расширяют рынок. Глядя на десятилетний период времени, вы будете иметь компьютеры, которые стоят столько же, сколько обычный телевизор. На самом деле разница между телевизором и ПК будет невелика, потому что даже коробки, которые подключают телевизоры к кабельной системе, будут иметь процессор более мощный, чем тот, который мы имеем сегодня в самом дорогом ПК.\n\nБолее мелкие личные компаньоны станут обычными. Они будут включать в себя небольшие компьютеры, представленные сегодня на рынке, и новые компьютеры размером с кошелек, которые позволят осуществлять электронные операции. Телефон, радио и телевидение приобретут новые возможности по мере перехода на цифровые технологии. Некоторые машины будут с вами. Некоторые из них будут находиться в разных комнатах вашего дома. Другие станут стандартными в транспортных средствах.\n\nЛюбой из них позволит вам пользоваться электронной и голосовой почтой, получать информацию из биржевых сводок или других новостей, а также узнавать последние новости о погоде и вашем рейсе. Эти машины будут подключаться через провода или через технологии, которые не используют провода, такие как радио. Хотя машины будут работать независимо, они будут обмениваться данными между собой автоматически.\n\nЭти машины станут частью обычной жизни. Когда вы выходите из офиса на целый день, ваш персональный цифровой компаньон загружает вашу электронную почту, которая может включать список покупок от вашего мужа или жены. В магазине вы можете скачать новый рецепт, и все предметы для еды будут добавлены в ваш список. Ваш цифровой компаньон достаточно умен, чтобы говорить со всеми машинами, которые должны знать ваш домашний или рабочий график, но только говорит кухонным машинам о рецепте. С компьютера на кухне вы проверяете дом. На видеозаписи у входной двери видно, кто звонил, когда никого не было дома.\n\nЦифровые камеры безопасности, подключенные к сети, становятся все дешевле и станут обычным явлением для снижения краж. Некоторые школы предоставляют камеры, чтобы родители могли следить за своими детьми, пока они в школе.\n\nПока готовится ужин, вы заходите на личный сайт вашей большой семьи и обнаруживаете, что все в чате обсуждают, что делать, когда семья соберется. Они использовали электронное голосование, чтобы выбрать полдюжины возможных событий, и они попросили вас забронировать как можно больше из них. Программный агент, который знает, что вы уже забронировали поездку, предлагает несколько вещей, которые можно сделать на месте, включая Парусный спорт, который был в списке вашей семьи. Агент также сообщает вам о новом, более низком тарифе на перелет до места назначения. Вы в цифровом виде заказываете Парусный спорт и более низкие тарифы.\n\nКогда вы будете готовы смотреть телевизор, вы можете посмотреть электронное руководство по программированию на экране или использовать другой программный агент, чтобы узнать, что происходит. Вы рассказали агенту о своих вкусах просмотра, и он отследил ваши фактические модели просмотра, поэтому он рекомендует несколько шоу из сотен доступных на цифровом телевидении. Вы решили посмотреть футбольный матч. Во время просмотра вы используете интерактивное меню, чтобы принять участие в конкурсе и проголосовать за самого ценного игрока. Зрительские баллы будут засчитываться за половину конечного результата. Вы смотрите рекламу автомобиля. Большинство зрителей видят рекламу грузовика, но данные, которые вы добровольно предоставили по телевизору, указывают на то, что вы лучше подходите для семейного автомобиля.\n\nРазвитие интеллектуального, интерактивного телевидения будет происходить по мере перехода телевидения к цифровым технологиям. Цифровые трансляции легко исправляются на ошибки и позволяют получать высококачественное видео и звук. Однако цифровое телевидение может сделать гораздо больше, чем просто улучшить качество вещания. Спутниковые и кабельные компании уже используют цифровое телевидение для доставки большего количества каналов. Со временем самый большой эффект цифрового телевидения будет заключаться в возможности включать другие цифровые данные, обеспечивая интерактивность, интеллектуальное программное обеспечение, целевую рекламу и коммерческие предложения, а также интернет.\n\nВещатели будут предоставлять больший контент, такой как ссылки на соответствующие веб-сайты или совершенно новый веб-контент, который добавляет к трансляции, или музыку, или программное обеспечение, которое можно загрузить за плату. Многие из новых функций требуют двусторонней связи, что легко для новых систем кабельного телевидения. Новая технология упростит интерфейс телевизора. Попытка записать одну или несколько программ в определенное время и в определенные дни остается раздражающе сложной. В будущем записать на пленку шоу будет так же просто, как сказать телевизору, что именно вы хотите записать. Использование речи для взаимодействия с телевизором, компьютером или другими личными компаньонами станет обычным явлением в течение десяти лет.\n\nПропускная способность, пропускная способность цифровой коммуникационной системы, остается самым большим препятствием для широкого внедрения веб-образа жизни во всех странах. Пропускная способность также является самой большой стоимостью. В развитых странах компании обычно могут позволить себе пропускную способность, необходимую для работы в цифровом формате, потому что многие коммуникационные компании подключают деловые районы. Но потребуется гораздо больше времени, чтобы получить доступную проводку в дома, школы и библиотеки, что имеет решающее значение для достижения полностью подключенного общества. Мы увидим преимущества веб-образа жизни только тогда, когда будут созданы системы с высокой пропускной способностью. Наиболее важным шагом для страны по созданию инфраструктуры с высокой пропускной способностью является стимулирование конкуренции в отрасли связи.\n\nУченые всего мира исследуют новые коммуникационные технологии - и старые. Недавно один британский инженер разработал способ передачи высокоскоростных голосовых и информационных сигналов на обычном электрическом токе, что повысило вероятность того, что интернет-сервис однажды сможет проникнуть в ваш дом по существующей инфраструктуре электрических проводов. Эта и другие технологии, такие как спутниковое вещание, являются захватывающими, потому что они не требуют от нас замены существующей проводки, которая уже соединяет большинство домов в развитых странах. Создание веб-инфраструктуры по всему миру-это огромная задача, но прогресс во многих областях делает вероятным, что скорость улучшения удивит всех в следующем десятилетии.\n\nСоциальные последствия веб-образа жизни будут огромны. Многие люди боятся, что компьютеры и интернет сделают жизнь менее личной, создав менее теплый и дружелюбный мир. Некоторые люди поначалу опасались, что телефон тоже сократит контакт лицом к лицу. Два человека могут звонить друг другу, когда они разговаривали бы лицом к лицу без телефона, и два человека могут писать друг другу по электронной почте, когда они встретились бы лицом к лицу без электронной почты.\n\nЛюбой носитель может быть плохо использован. Развитие личных и профессиональных манер для интернета будет продолжаться. Достаточно легко сказать, что веб-образ жизни, в котором каждый живет в своем маленьком мире, приведет к тому, что общество развалится. Я считаю, что на самом деле все наоборот. Точно так же, как телефон и электронная почта увеличили контакт между людьми, живущими в разных сообществах, компьютер и интернет дают нам другой способ общения. Они ничего не забирают.\n\nНа самом деле возможность использовать Интернет для перемещения или изменения границ наших сообществ укрепляет личные и культурные связи. В Амстердаме, в Нидерландах, проходят интернет-дискуссии по таким вопросам, как городское планирование, безопасность и наркотики. Граждане могут связаться с полицией по электронной почте. Египетский сайт для детей под названием \"Маленький гор\" содержит более 300 страниц информации и фотографий, охватывающих 7000-летнюю цивилизацию Египта. Он также содержит информацию о сегодняшнем Египте, включая его экономическую, культурную и социальную жизнь. В разделе \" тур \" представлены советы по популярным направлениям для детей.\n\nВеб-стиль жизни-это расширение горизонтов, а не их сужение. Создание сообществ станет одной из самых больших областей роста в ближайшие несколько лет в Интернете. Сеть резко увеличивает количество сообществ, к которым вы можете присоединиться.\n\nВ прошлом у вас, возможно, было время, чтобы быть частью вашего соседского сообщества и одной или двух общественных организаций. В веб-образе жизни вы ограничены только своими интересами.\n\nОдним из самых мощных эффектов Интернета является то, как он может соединять группы людей независимо от географии или часовых поясов. Если вы хотите собрать группу увлеченных игроков в карты или поговорить о проблемах с людьми, которые разделяют ваши политические взгляды, Интернет делает это легко. Если вы хотите следить за тем, что происходит в вашем родном городе, Интернет может помочь.\n\nКак мы собираемся найти время, чтобы вести веб-образ жизни и присоединяться к большему количеству сообществ? Сеть сделает вещи более эффективными, чем они были раньше. Вы можете быстро узнать, сколько стоит ваш подержанный автомобиль, спланировать поездку или узнать все, что вам нужно знать, когда вы хотите сделать крупную покупку. Сегодня в интернете все это очень просто. И люди, вероятно, обменяют часть времени, которое они сейчас проводят за чтением газет или просмотром телевизора, на информацию или развлечения, которые они найдут в Интернете. Британское исследование 1998 года показало, что около 25% взрослых британцев, пользующихся Интернетом, смотрят телевизор меньше, чем раньше.\n\nБольшая часть этой книги посвящена тому, чтобы иметь всю необходимую информацию на кончиках пальцев. Большинство людей хотят найти лучшую цену на продукт или быть в курсе важных вопросов, затрагивающих их местные или национальные сообщества. Мы обошлись без этой информации, потому что получить ее было просто слишком сложно. Веб-стиль жизни не связан с изменением человеческой природы или основ того, как люди живут. Вместо этого веб-стиль жизни дает большему количеству людей возможность лучше преследовать свои интересы.\n\nВеб-стиль жизни изменит то, как люди делают покупки. Поскольку интернет - это самая большая в мире коллекция торговых центров, у клиентов будет выбор, которого у них раньше не было. Они смогут найти все варианты товаров, которые они хотят, и, во многих случаях, сделать их специально. Они могут получить конечный продукт, доставленный прямо к их дверям. Поскольку клиенты требуют более быстрого и личного обслуживания и более прочных отношений, веб-стиль жизни будет побуждать компании развивать цифровую нервную систему, чтобы оставаться со своими конкурентами.\n\nСеть по-новому соединяет работников, друзей и семьи. Сообщества, основанные на общих интересах, формируются с членами со всего мира. Правительства имеют возможность привлекать граждан больше, чем когда-либо прежде. Позволяя людям делать покупки, получать новости, встречаться друг с другом, развлекаться и сплетничать так, как мы только сейчас начинаем понимать, Интернет становится городской площадью для деревни, которой мир станет завтра.\n\nС помощью веб-образа жизни люди могут преодолеть многие барьеры, которые существовали так долго, что мы почти принимаем их как должное. Веб-стиль жизни-это не усложнение и без того напряженной жизни. По мере того, как люди привыкают к веб-образу жизни, они в конечном итоге принимают его бездумно, точно так же, как они делают электрический образ жизни, который они живут сегодня.\n\nИзменение границ бизнеса\n\nПоток цифровой информации меняет способ работы людей, организаций и предприятий. Интернет-технологии также изменят границы организаций всех размеров. При изменении границ \"веб-стиль работы\" с использованием цифровых инструментов и процессов позволяет как организациям, так и отдельным лицам менять свои роли. Корпорация может использовать Интернет для бесперебойной работы с профессионалами, такими как юристы и бухгалтеры, которые остаются \"вне\" стен компании. Важный принцип реинжиниринга заключается в том, что компании должны сосредоточиться на своих базовых навыках и передать все остальное на аутсорсинг. Интернет позволяет компании делать это в большей степени, чем когда-либо прежде, изменяя, какие сотрудники работают внутри стен, а какие-снаружи в другой роли.\n\nНаши основные навыки в Microsoft - это создание объемных программных продуктов, работа с другими компаниями-разработчиками программного обеспечения, а также обслуживание и поддержка клиентов. Мы передаем на аутсорсинг ряд функций, которые не подпадают под эти категории, от технической поддержки наших сотрудников до физического производства наших программных пакетов. Веб-стиль работы позволяет лучше справляться с непредсказуемым спросом. Поскольку у вас есть большая потребность в навыке, а затем вы его не получаете, для некоторых областей вы хотите иметь возможность нанять персонал на короткое время, чтобы иметь дело с вершинами и долинами. Интернет означает, что все больше компаний могут использовать \"студийный\" подход к управлению основными частями своего бизнеса. У крупных голливудских студий есть штатные сотрудники, которые занимаются финансами, маркетингом и другими непрерывными проектами, но творческая сторона бизнеса, штатный персонал кинопроизводства, вообще не очень велик. Когда концепция фильма согласована, режиссер собирает большую группу людей для создания фильма. Закончив, они переходят к другим проектам.\n\nВеб-технология позволяет структурировать множество различных видов проектов в виде студийных работ. Владелец проекта, который хочет нанять команду, может выйти в интернет, описать проект и узнать, кто доступен. Люди и организации с нужными навыками могут заявить о своей заинтересованности, и владелец проекта может быстро создать команду. Люди, ищущие работу, найдут больше возможностей для трудоустройства, отвечающего их конкретным интересам и потребностям-например, если у них есть узкоспециализированные навыки или если они хотят работать только определенные часы.\n\nНесмотря на эти изменения, крупные фирмы не будут разбиваться на отдельные производственные компании. Крупные компании будут продолжать балансировать нагрузку на свою работу, как и всегда, - они просто будут использовать технологии, чтобы делать это более эффективно. Каждая компания будет экспериментировать, чтобы найти свой наиболее эффективный размер и организационную структуру, хотя тенденция будет в сторону небольших компаний. Средние и малые компании могут воспользоваться изменяющимися границами возможностей Интернета, чтобы действовать намного больше, чем они есть, без добавления сотрудников или офисов. Небольшая компания с нужными навыками может участвовать в торгах и руководить производством фильмов, строительством или рекламным проектом. Быстро объединившись с другими компаниями и профессионалами, она может действовать как виртуальная крупная компания, чтобы работать над проектом до его прибыльного завершения. Поскольку команда может быть распущена в конце проекта, компания может управлять трудовыми ресурсами без административной нагрузки большого штатного персонала.\n\nНекоторые сотрудники в компаниях любого размера, естественно, нервничают из-за влияния веб-стиля работы. Они предполагают, что если их компания решит строить себя на основе веб-технологий, их рабочие места могут исчезнуть. Они не будут - если только \"реструктуризация\" не является просто причудливым термином, чтобы скрыть увольнения. Когда компания сокращается, рабочие места теряются. Когда компания отдает работу на аутсорсинг, рабочие места перемещаются. Цель не в том, чтобы избавиться от работы, а в том, чтобы переложить ответственность на специалистов извне. Для многих компаний, в том числе и для Microsoft, гораздо эффективнее иметь внешнюю компанию, которая занимается установкой и поддержкой небольших компьютеров, например, потому что компании, специализирующиеся на такой работе, могут развивать лучшие в мире навыки и потому что мы можем запросить конкурентные предложения для этой работы.\n\nСотрудники, которые реагируют на возможность аутсорсинга со страхом, предполагают, что работа принадлежит \"внутри\" компании, а не \"вне\". По мере того как компании меняются, у некоторых людей возникают трудности. Несмотря на понятную тревогу, сотрудники также должны смотреть на изменения как на возможность определить свою работу так, как они хотят, и работать в организации того размера и личности, которые они предпочитают. Они могут даже использовать эту революцию как шанс начать свой собственный бизнес. Не так давно один человек, который был писателем, наблюдал за тем, как Microsoft отдает свою писательскую работу на аутсорсинг,и увидел возможность. Сегодня этот человек прекрасно справляется с десятком или более писателей, и сотрудники Microsoft тратят свое время на определение работы, которую нужно сделать, вместо того чтобы пытаться управлять процессом написания для группы разных людей. В целом изменения в организационной структуре пойдут на пользу хорошим сотрудникам.\n\nВеб-стиль работы особенно хорошо подходит юристам, врачам, бухгалтерам и инженерам, которые обычно работают независимо или в небольших командах. Одна из причин, по которой профессионалы традиционно объединяются в фирмы, заключается в том, чтобы иметь дело с ростом и падением потребительского спроса. Теперь вместо того, чтобы объединиться, чтобы убедиться, что рабочая нагрузка распределена, они также будут иметь возможность работать самостоятельно и использовать Интернет для поиска клиентов.\n\nНе каждый выберет такой подход. Многие хотят работать в крупных фирмах. Им нравится идея принадлежать к одной компании, работать над долгосрочными проектами и быть частью сообщества и культуры конкретного рабочего места. Они инвестируют в свою карьеру, и компания инвестирует в них. Многие из самых интересных работ, таких как разработка программного обеспечения в моей компании, являются центральными областями, которые не будут переданы на аутсорсинг. Большинство компаний, в том числе Microsoft, упорно работают над тем, чтобы хорошие сотрудники оставались привлекательными в долгосрочной перспективе. Разработчики присоединяются к Microsoft, потому что видят возможность разрабатывать программное обеспечение или технологии, которые будут использоваться миллионами людей. Как и многие художники, они хотят, чтобы их работы охватили как можно большую аудиторию.\n\nЛюди, которые хотят работать в большой компании, будут работать на нее, а те, кто не хочет, будут иметь интересные альтернативы. Веб-стиль работы также облегчает работу людям, которые имеют хорошие навыки, но не могут или не хотят работать полный рабочий день. Поскольку они могут найти больше работы через Интернет и делать больше работы из дома, у этих людей появятся новые возможности. Общество выиграет, если будет лучше использовать этот огромный резерв талантов.\n\nКак бизнес-менеджер, вы должны внимательно изучить свои базовые навыки. Посмотрите еще раз на те области вашей компании, которые непосредственно не вовлечены в эту работу, и подумайте, могут ли веб-технологии позволить вам передать эти задачи на аутсорсинг. Пусть другая компания возьмет на себя ответственность за управление этой работой и использует современные коммуникационные технологии для тесной работы с людьми - теперь партнерами, а не сотрудниками,-выполняющими эту работу. Кроме того, подумайте о сотрудниках, которые имеют хорошие навыки и опыт, но решают, что они не хотят работать полный рабочий день. Лучшие средства коммуникации могут позволить вам продолжать использовать этих людей. В ближайшие годы конкуренция за найм лучших сотрудников будет только возрастать. Компании, которые предоставляют дополнительную свободу своим сотрудникам, будут иметь преимущество в этой ключевой области.\n\nСначала доберитесь до рынка\n\nПокупателям нужны качественные продукты по низким ценам, и они хотят их сейчас. Каждый бизнес, будь то производитель товаров и услуг или поставщик этого производителя, должен быстро реагировать, сохраняя высокое качество и низкую цену. Информационные технологии стали одним из основных факторов, способствующих более быстрому реагированию, более высокому качеству и более низкому росту цен, которые определили бизнес в последнее десятилетие.\n\nНемногие отрасли промышленности иллюстрируют два основных давления сокращения времени и улучшения качества лучше, чем автомобильная промышленность. Японские модели автомобилей в 1980-х годах выглядели более свежими, а их качество улучшалось чаще, чем в американских автомобилях, потому что японские автопроизводители могли перевести автомобиль из концепции в массовое производство за три года. Американским автопроизводителям обычно требовалось от четырех до шести лет, и их затраты были выше.\n\nАмериканские компании отреагировали на это, разрушив организационные барьеры, отделявшие отделы проектирования, производства и продаж друг от друга. Они также улучшили связь со своими внешними партнерами. Дизайнеры, инженеры, поставщики и производственный персонал начали работать в тесных командах, которые общались в электронном виде, сокращая время от разработки продукта до торгового зала наполовину.\n\nДругим технологическим усовершенствованиям в автомобильной промышленности значительно помогли технологии, в том числе автоматизированное проектирование (САПР) автомобилей. Возможности 3D-моделирования программ САПР позволяют инженерам проектировать транспортное средство без необходимости сначала создавать модель вручную. Проектировщики могут видеть, будут ли детали подходить друг к другу, и могут изменять конструкцию деталей без создания специальных инструментов. Электронные связи между производителями автомобилей и поставщиками уже снизили частоту ошибок в поставляемых деталях на 72 процента и сэкономили до восьми часов в неделю на каждый автомобиль в затратах на рабочую силу.\n\nКлиенты выигрывали от более качественных автомобилей, производимых быстрее. Достижения Ford в производстве являются репрезентативными для всей автомобильной промышленности. В 1990 году компании потребовалось пять или более лет, чтобы довести автомобиль от концепции до клиента, и она испытала 150 неисправностей на каждые 100 автомобилей, или 1,5 неисправности на автомобиль. К 1998 году Ford сократил время своего цикла более чем наполовину, до менее чем двадцати четырех месяцев. Уровень неисправностей снизился со 150 до 81 неисправности на 100 автомобилей.\n\nВ некоторых отраслях проблема быстро выходит на рынок, когда изменения становятся все более сложными. Intel, например, всегда имела девяностодневный производственный цикл для своих чипов, которые питают большинство ПК. Intel рассчитывает сохранить этот девяностодневный темп производства, хотя процессор становится все более и более сложным. Количество транзисторов в чипе увеличилось с 29 000 в чипе 8086 до 7,5 миллионов в Pentium в 1998 году, а то, на что способен процессор, выросло на 10 000 за те же двадцать лет. К 2011 году Intel планирует поставить чипы с одним миллиардом транзисторов. Закон Мура гласит, что мощность чипов удваивается каждые восемнадцать-двадцать четыре месяца. Если бы машины и хлопья шли одним и тем же путем, то по закону Мура машина стоила бы двадцать семь долларов, а коробка хлопьев-Пенни.\n\nIntel использует различные методы управления, производства и цифровые методы для поддержания эффективности, помещая все больше и больше транзисторов на чип размером с миниатюру. Каждый раз, когда меняется производственный процесс, строятся новые заводы, стоимость каждого из которых превышает миллиард долларов.\n\nВ 1998 году Intel внедрила стратегию \"точной копии\", чтобы поддерживать одинаковый уровень эффективности и качества на всех своих заводах по производству чипов. Программа под названием D2000 позаботилась о том, чтобы каждый инженер-проектировщик получил преимущества передового опыта всей организации. Intel обнаружила, что более 60 процентов проблем, с которыми столкнулись дизайнеры, уже были решены другой командой разработчиков. Очень вероятно, что любая крупная компания, использующая ручные процессы, найдет такое же количество повторной работы. D2000 помог Intel почти удвоить скорость производства новых продуктов с 1994 года, и он помог Intel достичь своей цели массового производства с первого дизайна чипа, не проходя через несколько версий дизайна, чтобы получить его правильно.\n\nХотя банки всегда были крупными пользователями информационных технологий, у них не было репутации быстрого выхода на рынок с новыми продуктами или услугами, за исключением Banco Bradesco, крупнейшего банка Бразилии. Имея почти 2200 филиалов и двадцать миллионов клиентов, Banco Bradesco имеет активы в размере 68,7 миллиарда долларов и обслуживает три миллиона человек в день. Это был первый бразильский банк, который использовал компьютеры в 1962 году, и это был первый банк, который предложил автоматизированные банкоматы в 1982 году. Banco Bradesco использует технологии, чтобы оставаться впереди конкурентов. Даже шесть месяцев-это слишком долго, чтобы вывести идею на рынок; обычный цикл развития составляет недели или, самое большее, несколько месяцев. Банк также стремится одновременно донести новый продукт или услугу до всей своей клиентской базы.\n\nДля одного клиента из малого бизнеса компания Bradesco разработала программное обеспечение, помогающее вкладывать деньги в бизнес и выводить их из него. Сейчас этой программой пользуются около 4100 предприятий. Для другого клиента Bradesco разработала зарплатную карту, которую сотрудники могли использовать в банкомате Bradesco, даже если у них не было счета в банке. В настоящее время эта карта используется примерно в 1300 компаниях и вскоре будет использоваться в 2000 компаниях с миллионом сотрудников. В каждом случае Брадеско был первым банком, предложившим эту услугу.\n\nВ 1996 году Banco Bradesco стал первым банком в Бразилии и только пятым в мире, который использовал Интернет для предоставления банковских услуг. К 1998 году число онлайн-клиентов росло на 12% в месяц. Интернет-банкинг в Бразилии более популярен, чем в любой другой стране. Веб-сайт банка BradescoNet предлагает полный спектр финансовых услуг. Будучи первым важным коммерческим интернет-сайтом в Бразилии, банк имеет возможность стать сайтом, через который бразильцы проходят, чтобы попасть на другие сайты. Какой лучший способ сохранить лояльность клиентов к вашей компании?\n\nНо банк признает, что в будущем ему необходимо еще лучше использовать свою цифровую нервную систему. Банк хочет собрать больше информации о каждом клиенте, чтобы продавать новые финансовые продукты, ориентированные на нужных людей. Например, если программа находит клиента, оплачивающего страхование автомобиля, банк может предложить кредит на покупку нового автомобиля, даже если клиент финансировал свой нынешний автомобиль в другом банке. Данные о клиентах - один из лучших активов банка. Брадеско потребуется несколько лет, чтобы собрать воедино всю имеющуюся у них информацию, но когда они это сделают, они смогут предложить гораздо больше финансовых услуг, ориентированных на нужных людей.\n\nВремя выхода на рынок в индустрии ПК прошло быстрее, чем где-либо еще. В этой ситуации лучший поток цифровой информации не просто улучшает компанию, он необходим для ее успеха.\n\nВсего за несколько лет производственный цикл компьютеров Compaq сократился с восемнадцати до двенадцати месяцев. К концу 1998 года он снизился до шести-девяти месяцев для бизнес-продуктов и до четырех месяцев для потребительских товаров. Но с более старыми информационными системами Compaq потребовалось сорок пять дней, чтобы собрать информацию о продажах по всему миру и свести ее к единому набору цифр, необходимых для планирования продукта. К тому времени, когда она сможет сообщить о своих производственных потребностях своим поставщикам, компания пройдет половину четырехмесячного жизненного цикла важных продуктов.\n\nCompaq запустила систему планирования корпоративных ресурсов (ERP). Все его заводы теперь используют одно и то же программное обеспечение, поэтому все данные, поступающие в ERP, совместимы. Сорокапятидневный цикл планирования теперь сократился до недели. Хотя недельные продажи необходимы для того, чтобы увидеть долгосрочные тенденции продаж, в будущем он будет иметь данные о продажах за день.\n\nCompaq также использует системы реального времени, которые помогают ей реагировать на незапланированные изменения спроса. Используя те же данные, которые поступают в ERP, Compaq хочет трижды за ночь, с интервалом в восемь часов, посмотреть на свои позиции по поставкам и заказам в США, Европе и Азии. Используя данные в режиме реального времени вместо данных недельной или даже дневной давности, Compaq хочет иметь возможность видеть и реагировать, например, на незапланированный заказ на 7000 ПК, а также работать с поставщиками, чтобы сразу увидеть, сможет ли компания доставить заказ вовремя.\n\nЧтобы иметь возможность двигаться как можно быстрее, компания Compaq перенесла все свои информационные системы в интернет. Система электронной коммерции означает, что, когда приходит заказ, поставщик видит это одновременно с планировщиком Compaq. Но все это должно быть сделано, пока производство еще продолжается. Джон Уайт, главный информационный директор Compaq в 1998 году, сказал, что это все равно что менять крылья и двигатель реактивного самолета, пока он еще летает.\n\nДругое программное решение: получаете ли вы все ERP-программное обеспечение от одной компании или получаете лучшее от множества разных компаний? Поскольку совместимость очень важна, большинство компаний обращаются к одной компании для удовлетворения всех своих потребностей в ERP. Но Microsoft заинтересована в том, чтобы ERP работала либо в разных версиях, либо с одним набором программного обеспечения. Решения Compaq-хороший пример того, как технологии и бизнес зависят друг от друга и помогают друг другу.\n\nЦифровые процессы позволяют каждой компании значительно сократить время выхода на рынок, хотя для доставки физических товаров всегда требуется определенное количество времени и энергии. Николас Негропонте из Массачусетского технологического института описывает разницу между физическими продуктами и информационными продуктами в цифровую эпоху как разницу между перемещением атомов (физические продукты, такие как автомобили и компьютеры) и перемещением битов (электронные продукты, такие как финансовый анализ и новостные передачи). Производители бит могут использовать Интернет, чтобы сократить время доставки почти до нуля. Производители атомов все еще не могут этого сделать, но они могут использовать битовую скорость-цифровую организацию всех видов-чтобы резко сократить время реакции. Почти все время, затрачиваемое на производство изделия, уходит на организацию работы, а не на само производство.\n\nХорошие информационные системы могут убрать большую часть этого времени ожидания. И производители физических продуктов обнаружат, что онлайн-сервис станет такой же частью их \"продукта\" и потребительского опыта, как и физические товары, которые они поставляют. Скорость доставки и взаимодействия с клиентом, ставшая возможной благодаря Интернету, эффективно превращает продукты в услуги. Продуктовые компании сегодня должны сравнивать себя не с лучшими из своих конкурентов, а с лучшими из всех сервисных компаний.\n\nВ конце концов, самый важный вопрос скорости для компаний-это культура. Это меняет то, что все предполагают о том, как быстро они должны двигаться. Все должны понимать, что если вы не удовлетворяете потребительский спрос достаточно быстро, не снижая качества, это сделает конкурент. Когда люди принимают необходимость действий, цифровые технологии позволяют быстро реагировать.\n\nГлава третья.\n\nУправление знаниями для улучшения.\n\nСтратегическое Мышление.\n\nПлохие новости должны распространяться быстро.\n\nУ меня есть природная способность находить плохие новости. Если он там, я хочу знать об этом. Люди, которые работают на меня, поняли это и держат меня в курсе.\n\nМногое идет не так в любой организации, даже в хорошей. Продукт выходит из строя. Вас удивляет клиент, который внезапно переключается на другую компанию. Конкурент выпускает продукт, который привлекает широкий новый рынок. Потеря доли рынка-это такая плохая новость, которую может понять каждая организация. Другие плохие новости могут касаться того, что происходит внутри компании. Может быть, продукт опоздает, или он не будет делать то, что вы ожидали, или вы не смогли нанять достаточно подходящих людей для выполнения ваших планов. Существенным качеством хорошего менеджера является желание искать плохие новости, а не отрицать их. Эффективный менеджер хочет услышать о том, что происходит не так, прежде чем он или она услышит о том, что происходит правильно. Вы не можете адекватно реагировать на неутешительные новости, если они не доходят до вас достаточно быстро.\n\nВы концентрируетесь на плохих новостях, чтобы быстро приступить к решению. Как только вы осознаете проблему, все в вашей организации должны начать действовать. Вы можете судить о компании по тому, как быстро она организует все свои мозговые силы, чтобы справиться с серьезной проблемой. Важным показателем цифровой нервной системы компании является то, как быстро люди в компании узнают о плохих новостях и реагируют на них. Цифровые технологии ускоряют время реагирования бизнеса в любой чрезвычайной ситуации.\n\nВ прежние времена реакция любой компании на плохие новости была медленной. Бизнес-лидеры часто узнавали о проблемах только после того, как они становились серьезными, поскольку единственным быстрым способом передать информацию было прервать их телефонным звонком. Прежде чем решить проблему, люди должны были найти информацию в бумажных файлах или спуститься в холл, чтобы найти кого-то, кто знал что-то о ситуации. Когда у людей была какая-то информация, они разговаривали по телефону или посылали друг другу бумаги. Каждый шаг в этом процессе занимал много времени. Сегодня, на заре информационной эры, мы можем отправлять информацию быстро, но даже сейчас большинство компаний не собирают ключевую информацию о проблемах клиентов в одном месте. Напротив, хорошо продуманная цифровая нервная система работает как система раннего предупреждения.\n\nИнтернет не всегда был главным приоритетом Microsoft. Его появление изменило наш бизнес и стало самым большим сюрпризом, на который нам когда-либо приходилось реагировать. Фактически, в 1995 году различные эксперты говорили, что интернет выведет Microsoft из бизнеса. Это были плохие новости в огромном масштабе. Мы использовали нашу цифровую нервную систему, чтобы отреагировать на этот кризис.\n\n24 августа 1995 года мы представили Windows 95, самый амбициозный программный продукт, когда-либо достигавший широкого потребителя. Это была большая новость, и сотни историй появились за несколько месяцев до выхода. Журнал Windows сказал:\"в этом году - к лучшему или худшему - Microsoft выигрывает войну\". В статье журнала Time говорилось, что Microsoft является \"центром компьютерной вселенной\". Появление Windows 95 само по себе было показано в основных телевизионных новостных передачах. Через пару месяцев, однако, все новости приняли противоположную точку зрения. Интернет ворвался в общественное сознание, и люди поверили, что Microsoft не была приглашена на новую вечеринку. Теперь в прессе появились сообщения о том, что мы не понимаем Интернета. Более мелкие и быстрые конкуренты вытеснили бы Microsoft из бизнеса.\n\n7 декабря 1995 года мы провели наш первый день Интернета, где впервые публично продемонстрировали спектр технологий, которые мы разрабатываем для внедрения интернет-поддержки в наши продукты. В течение года после этого мы \"включили Интернет\" наши основные продукты и поставили ряд новых, которые сосредоточились на интернете. Сейчас мы лидируем в нескольких крупных интернет-направлениях. Ни одна компания не будет доминировать в интернете, но Microsoft вернулась, чтобы играть важную роль.\n\nКак, часто спрашивают меня наши клиенты и пресса,мы так быстро развернули корабль? Во-первых, мы никогда не были настолько неосведомлены об интернете, как это могло бы показаться сторонним наблюдателям. Это не было похоже на то, что кто-то сказал \"Интернет\", и мы не знали, как это пишется. В нашем списке было несколько интернет-технологий. Но давайте также внесем ясность. В 1993 году мы не концентрировались на интернете. Это был пятый или шестой приоритет. В то время у нас не было общего интернет-плана для компании. Мы не ожидали, что интернет, сеть для ученых и инженеров, превратится во Всемирную коммерческую сеть, которой он является сегодня. Интернет тогда обладал такой ограниченной способностью передавать цифровую информацию, что мы рассматривали его как незначительную остановку на этом пути. Внезапный рост популярности Интернета изменил все правила. Люди знали, что у интернета есть недостатки, но он делал доступными огромные объемы информации и позволял легко общаться. Только в 1993 году число пользователей Интернета удвоилось и составило более двадцати пяти миллионов человек.\n\nДвижущая сила реакции Microsoft на интернет исходила не от меня и не от других руководителей высшего звена. Он исходил от небольшого числа восторженных сотрудников, которые видели, что происходит. Через наши электронные системы они смогли заставить всех присоединиться к ним. Их история-пример нашей практики, с самого первого дня, что умные люди в любом месте компании должны иметь власть, чтобы изменить ситуацию. Это очевидный способ работы компаний информационной эпохи: все работники умственного труда должны участвовать в создании плана. Но мы не могли бы заставить его работать без технологии, которую мы используем. В течение многих лет у каждого сотрудника Microsoft был компьютер с электронной почтой. Это известная часть нашей корпоративной культуры, и она формирует то, как мы думаем и действуем.\n\nБольшинство важных решений в ходе этого кризиса мы приняли в ходе личных бесед. Но все наши решения были основаны на обмене сообщениями по электронной почте. Совместная электронная работа не может заменить личных встреч. Это способ убедиться, что перед собраниями делается больше работы, чтобы личные встречи были более полезными. Время встречи настолько ценно, что вы хотите быть уверены, что имеете дело с фактами и хорошими идеями, основанными на твердом анализе. Вы хотите быть уверены, что на встречах вы строите планы, а не просто сидите и рассуждаете о философии. Электронная почта помогает превратить менеджеров из посредников в\"делателей\". Это побуждает людей высказываться. Это побуждает менеджеров прислушиваться. Вот почему, когда клиенты спрашивают, что они могут сделать в первую очередь, чтобы получить больше пользы от своих информационных систем, я всегда отвечаю: \"электронная почта\".\n\nНасколько быстро компания может отреагировать в чрезвычайной ситуации, является хорошим показателем того, насколько хорошо она реагирует на события. Люди в организации будут чувствовать угрозу от плохих новостей, но это нормально, если они чувствуют это как группа. Как лидер, я создал ощущение кризиса в Интернете в 1994 и 1995 годах. Не для того, чтобы оставить людей несчастными или неспособными работать, а для того, чтобы побудить их к действию. Лидер должен создать среду, в которой люди смогут проанализировать ситуацию и выработать адекватную реакцию.\n\nЯ люблю хорошие новости так же, как и любой другой человек, но они также вызывают у меня подозрения. Интересно, какие плохие новости я не слышу? Когда кто-то присылает мне электронное письмо о выигранном нами счете, я всегда думаю: \"есть много счетов, о которых никто не писал. Значит ли это, что мы все это потеряли?\n\nЭта реакция может показаться излишней,но я обнаружил, что у людей есть психологическая потребность посылать хорошие новости, когда приходят плохие. Как будто они хотят смягчить шок. Хорошая система электронной почты гарантирует, что плохие новости могут распространяться быстро, но ваши люди должны быть готовы отправить вам новости. Вы всегда должны быть открыты для плохих новостей, и тогда вы должны действовать в соответствии с ними. Иногда я думаю, что моя самая важная работа как босса-это выслушивать плохие новости. Если вы не будете действовать в соответствии с этим, ваши люди в конечном итоге перестанут сообщать вам плохие новости. И это начало конца.\n\nЧерез три года все продукты, которые производит моя компания, устареют. Вопрос только в том, заменим ли мы их или кто-то другой. В ближайшие десять лет, если Microsoft останется лидером, нам придется справиться как минимум с тремя крупными кризисами. Вот почему мы всегда должны делать лучше. Я настаиваю на том, чтобы мы следили за событиями, а также занимались долгосрочными проектами, и чтобы мы использовали \"плохие новости\", чтобы заставить нас внедрять новые функции в наши продукты. Однажды кто-нибудь застанет нас спящими. В один прекрасный день новая фирма выведет Microsoft из бизнеса. Я просто надеюсь, что это произойдет через пятьдесят лет, а не через два или пять.\n\nИзмените плохие новости на хорошие.\n\nЕсли вы относитесь к неприятным новостям не как к негативным, а как к свидетельству необходимости перемен, вы не будете побеждены ими. Ты учишься на этом. Учиться на ошибках и постоянно совершенствовать продукты-это ключ к успеху во всех компаниях. Слушание клиентов-большая часть этих усилий. Вы должны изучать то, что клиенты говорят о своих проблемах с вашими продуктами, и постоянно осознавать, чего они хотят.\n\nНо удивительно трудно получить плохие новости от клиентов, прошедших весь путь до групп дизайна продукта. Большинство компаний не имеют эффективной цепочки людей и бумаги между клиентами и людьми, которые могут сделать серьезные улучшения. Когда данные о клиентах, наконец, попадают в группу разработки продукта, команде часто бывает нелегко дать им правильный приоритет. Все эти задержки означают, что улучшения происходят не так быстро, как следовало бы.\n\nЯ рекомендую следующий подход к включению жалоб и списков пожеланий клиентов в процесс разработки продуктов и услуг:\n\n1. Сосредоточиться на ваши самые несчастные клиенты.\n\n2. используйте технологию, чтобы собрать богатую информацию об их неудачном опыте работы с вашим продуктом и выяснить, что они хотят, чтобы вы вложили в продукт.\n\n3. используйте технологию, чтобы быстро передавать новости нужным людям.\n\nЕсли вы сделаете эти три вещи, вы превратите эти плохие новости в захватывающий процесс улучшения вашего продукта или услуги. Недовольные клиенты всегда вызывают беспокойство. Они также являются вашей величайшей возможностью. Слушание и обучение вместо того, чтобы защищаться, могут сделать жалобы клиентов лучшим источником значительного улучшения качества. Принятие правильной технологии даст вам возможность быстро улавливать и преобразовывать жалобы в лучшие продукты и услуги.\n\nНапример, любой сотрудник Promus Hotels, базирующейся в Мемфисе, штат Теннесси, может вернуть клиентам их деньги, если они не удовлетворены. Гарантия возврата денег без вопросов от такой сервисной компании, как Promus, кое-что значит. У компании есть веская причина немедленно устранить проблему. И поскольку каждый сотрудник может действовать по гарантии, сотрудники следят за качеством. Так как же Promus останавливает клиентов, использующих гарантию бесплатного проживания и жалующихся, когда на самом деле все было в порядке? Технология. Все жалобы рассматриваются одним и тем же главным компьютером. Он может быстро идентифицировать любого, кто ходит из отеля в отель, заявляя о плохом обслуживании и получая деньги обратно. Затем промус посылает милое письмо, в котором сожалеет, что отели не могут соответствовать стандартам клиента, и приглашает его остановиться в отелях конкурента.\n\nЕсли ваши клиенты могут связаться с вами по электронной почте со своими проблемами, вы должны быть готовы ответить быстро. Когда клиент отправляет письмо в компанию, он не ожидает ответа в течение недели, но клиент знает, что письмо приходит через несколько минут, если не секунд. Обычно компании отвечают на электронную почту в течение нескольких часов или в течение ночи. Несколько дней - это \"медленно\". Если вам понадобятся недели, чтобы ответить, клиенты займутся своим бизнесом в другом месте. Поскольку электронную почту гораздо легче отправить, чем бумажную, вы, скорее всего, получите гораздо больше ответов. Поэтому, когда вы просите электронные ответы, убедитесь, что у вас есть персонал и внутренние системы, чтобы справиться с ними быстро.\n\nСлушайте своих клиентов и воспринимайте их плохие новости как возможность превратить ваши неудачи в улучшения, которые они хотят. Компании, которые рано инвестируют в цифровые нервные системы, чтобы фиксировать, анализировать и опираться на мнение клиентов, будут выделяться среди конкурентов. Вы должны рассматривать жалобы клиентов чаще, чем финансы компании. И ваши цифровые системы должны помочь вам превратить плохие новости в улучшенные продукты и услуги.\n\nЗнай свои цифры.\n\nJiffy Lube был мировым поставщиком автомобилей номер один, но он был убыточным, когда компания Pennzoil купила его в 1991 году. К 1997 году Jiffy Lube заработала 25 миллионов долларов-самый высокий заработок в своей истории и рост на 14 процентов по сравнению с 1996 годом. Jiffy Lube обслуживала 21 миллион автомобилей, что на 1,2 миллиона больше, чем в 1996 году. Движущей силой этого нового успеха был ежедневный поток информации из каждого магазина в штаб-квартиру и обратно. Информация об обслуживании клиентов из всех 1600 магазинов Jiffy Lube отправляется в штаб-квартиру в Хьюстоне каждую ночь. Штаб-квартира немедленно анализирует цифры. Начиная с 5 часов утра, последние данные доступны для каждого выхода смазки Jiffy. Например, если люди в одном районе не используют свою розетку Jiffy Lube так часто, как ожидалось, менеджер этой розетки будет знать об этом.\n\n\"Знай свои цифры\" - это основной бизнес-принцип. Вам нужно собирать данные о вашем бизнесе на каждом этапе и при каждом взаимодействии с вашими клиентами - и с вашими партнерами тоже. Тогда вам нужно понять, что означают эти данные. Цифры не должны быть вашей единственной заботой, но вы должны объективно понимать все возможное о вашем бизнесе. Например, если вы рассматриваете возможность обмена краткосрочной прибыли на долгосрочную прибыль, вам нужно как можно точнее знать стоимость этой сделки. Компании могут использовать собранные ими данные для повышения эффективности своего бизнеса, укрепления отношений как с клиентами, так и с партнерами, расширения своего бизнеса новыми способами и разработки более качественных услуг и новых продуктов.\n\nСуществует два способа использования данных клиентов. Во-первых, собрать цифры, которые показывают тенденции и закономерности, на которых основываются анализ, планирование и принятие решений. Второй - это сбор подробной информации об индивидуальном клиенте, чтобы вы могли предоставить персональное обслуживание. Создавая цифровой поток информации от начала до конца, компании могут создавать тесные связи между управлением знаниями, коммерцией и бизнес-операциями. В Microsoft мы показали большие улучшения, как только начали использовать MOET (Microsoft Order Entry Tool) для приема заказов клиентов, и MOET теперь является передовым веб-сайтом для электронной коммерции по всему миру.\n\nЧтобы хорошо использовать информацию, вам нужно с самого начала фиксировать ее в цифровом виде и анализировать в цифровом виде на каждом этапе ваших бизнес-процессов. \"Каждый этап\" включает в себя не только то, что происходит в стенах вашей компании, но и то, что происходит как с вашими клиентами, так и с вашими поставщиками. Знание ваших цифр может привести к большим изменениям во всех ваших деловых отношениях и дать вам значительное конкурентное преимущество.\n\nДеловая сторона любой компании начинается и заканчивается глубоким анализом ее численности. Что бы вы ни делали, если вы не понимаете, что происходит в вашем бизнесе на самом деле, и вы принимаете решения, основанные на мягких данных или эмоциях, вы в конечном итоге заплатите большую цену. Цифры дают вам фактическую основу для направления, в котором вы принимаете свои продукты. Они объективно говорят вам, что нравится клиентам, а что нет. Они помогают вам определить свои высшие приоритеты, чтобы вы могли быстро действовать. Ничто другое не может заменить понимание ваших чисел на рабочем уровне. Иногда мой друг Стив Балмер, президент Microsoft, удивляет членов продуктовой группы тем, что знает их ценовую структуру и показатели продаж - и конкурентов - лучше, чем люди, представляющие ему план. У него есть манера входить в комнату и сразу же задавать один вопрос, на который у команды нет ответа. Он выполнил свою работу, и он много думал о проблемах, которые вытекают из цифр. Он придает большое значение решениям, основанным на фактах.\n\nМенеджеры среднего звена в компании - это люди, которые должны анализировать цифры. Другие группы могут помочь, но люди, которые имеют дело с клиентами и конкурентными проблемами, должны каждый день смотреть на свой бизнес всеми возможными способами. Анализ должен поддерживать действия, а не просто еще больше анализа. Анализ должен шаг за шагом привести вас к решению и действию. Вы должны думать, действовать, судить, приспосабливаться.\n\nНачало работы с цифровыми числами не просто предотвращает ненужные усилия и ошибки. Это также приводит в движение лучшие способы последующей обработки данных. Будучи цифровым с самого начала, он повышает эффективность производства, доставки, выставления счетов и других операционных процессов. Получение данных в цифровом виде также является единственным способом убедиться, что вы получаете информацию достаточно быстро, чтобы реагировать на потребности клиентов до того, как это сделает ваш конкурент.\n\nЭта потребность в хорошей информации, чтобы побудить сотрудников к быстрым действиям, является одной из причин того, что \"бумажные номера\" беспокоят меня так же сильно, как бумажные формы. Напечатанная цифра объема продаж или напечатан номер на направления заказчиком является фиксированной. У вас нет возможности войти и проанализировать детали, стоящие за номером, или отправить его кому-нибудь по электронной почте, чтобы поговорить об этом. С номером бумаги, который выглядит неправильно, вы должны связаться с кем-то и сказать: \"я смотрю на этот отчет, и этот номер меня удивляет\". В большинстве случаев этому есть простое объяснение: клиент сделал большой заказ или отменил его. Вам ничего не нужно делать, но вы все равно хотите быстро узнать, почему результаты месяца выглядят странно. Если вы заметили тенденцию в бумажном отчете,трудно разослать бумагу и заставить людей проанализировать ее. Со временем вы перестаете обращать внимание, потому что это так трудно исследовать. Когда цифры находятся в цифровой форме, работники умственного труда могут изучать их, прикреплять к ним заметки, рассматривать их в любом количестве деталей или в любом виде, который они хотят, и передавать их, чтобы получить помощь. Число в цифровой форме-это начало мысли и действия.\n\nЦифровые технологии также позволяют компании создавать сеть партнеров, которая лучше обслуживает своих клиентов. Вы можете создать виртуальную компанию, в которой все объединены коммерцией, управлением знаниями и операционными системами. Ваши партнеры лучше связаны с вами, больше выигрывают от вашего успеха и естественно реагируют на те же модели поведения клиентов, что и вы.\n\nКогда ваши информационные системы предназначены для создания потока информации к вашим клиентам и от них, бизнес-процессы всей системы снабжения станут более эффективными. Своевременная доставка может стать реальностью для любой отрасли.\n\nЦифровой информационный поток позволяет создать организацию без ограничений, но требуется новая корпоративная культура, чтобы превратить поставщиков из \"них\" в \"нас\". Традиционно компании не рассматривали поставщиков как истинную часть общего бизнес-процесса, необходимого для обслуживания клиентов. Сегодняшний подход-это подход \"сети ценностей\", сети партнеров, поддерживаемой цифровым информационным потоком. Каждый, кто прикасается к продукту, должен добавлять ценность, и коммуникации идут как вперед, так и назад. Компании в сети создания ценности не ограничены тяжелыми цепочками процессов, но могут взаимодействовать и вести бизнес со многими различными продавцами по мере необходимости.\n\nЕсли преимущества знания ваших цифр и создания сети ценностей настолько убедительны, почему же больше компаний не делают этого? Почему все больше компаний не создают цифровой информационный поток для наблюдения за тенденциями? Почему они не следят за историей клиентов? Основная причина заключается в том, что слишком мало компаний начинают с цифровой информации. Существующие бумажные системы заставляют людей предполагать, что данные трудно получить и работать с ними. Им приходится работать с кипами бумаг, которые они не могут организовать или проанализировать. Они не могут найти закономерности в своих данных. Они не могут превратить свою бумажную информацию в действие. Поскольку сегодня так мало компаний используют цифровые инструменты внутри компании или с партнерами, те фирмы, которые действуют быстро, чтобы создать цифровую нервную систему, имеют возможность опередить своих конкурентов.\n\nЧтобы сделать переход к более эффективной виртуальной компании, нужно сначала посмотреть на все бумаги на столах работников умственного труда и спросить: как цифровые системы могли бы избавиться от этих кип бумаг? В рамках этого исследования подумайте о том, что ваши бизнес-процессы выходят далеко за пределы ваших стен и охватывают всю сеть ваших партнеров и клиентов. Вам нужно разработать бизнес-процессы, поддерживаемые быстрым и надежным потоком информации, который позволит клиенту управлять вашими ответами и ответами всех ваших продавцов, как если бы Вы были единым целым.\n\nВовлекайте людей в мыслительную работу.\n\nНеизбежным результатом совершенствования компьютерных систем является более разумное использование времени людей. Благодаря интеллектуальному программному обеспечению, постоянно просматривающему данные о продажах, отслеживающему тенденции и замечающему, что продается, а что нет, британская сеть магазинов Marks & Spencer может гораздо эффективнее использовать своих 500-600 покупателей.\n\nВместо того чтобы работать с толстыми бумажными отчетами за предыдущий день, пытаясь выяснить, хорошо ли идут продажи, покупатели могут использовать свое время более эффективно, используя то, что говорят им последние данные. Если продажи идут хорошо, никаких человеческих действий не требуется, но система проверяет данные о продажах и замечает любые товары, продажи которых выше или ниже ожидаемых. Отчеты по этим товарам создаются автоматически, и это все, с чем должны иметь дело покупатели.\n\nИспользование программного обеспечения для обработки рутинных задач обработки данных дает вам возможность обеспечить человеческое прикосновение там, где это действительно важно. Существует огромная разница между получением записки, которая была явно написана человеком, а не компьютером. Чрезвычайно ценно иметь человека, работающего с любым клиентом, который недоволен чем-то действительно важным или у которого есть особые потребности. Например, в отеле интеллектуальное программное обеспечение может значительно сократить время регистрации заезда и отъезда. Затем персонал может помочь клиентам, а не заполнять бланки, и в результате гости будут получать больше удовольствия от своего пребывания.\n\nОднако электронная торговля порождает новые проблемы. В физическом магазине продавец может использовать такие подсказки, как вопросы клиента, стиль одежды и язык тела, чтобы оценить его или ее интересы. Однако в интернет-магазине никто не видит клиента, и цель состоит в том, чтобы позволить клиенту сделать как можно больше покупок для себя. Владельцы интернет-магазинов тогда имеют некоторую интересную информацию, чтобы узнать. Основываясь на поведении клиента, как вы строите модель того, кто является покупателем? Это требует интеллектуального анализа данных.\n\nЦифровые инструменты анализа меняют характер работы. Работники умственного труда могут сосредоточиться на необычных событиях, а не на рутине. Конечно, людям не нравится, когда машины принимают за них решения. Но когда база данных становится достаточно большой и достаточно сложной, компьютер может выполнить первоначальный поиск и сортировку гораздо лучше, чем человек. Мы просто не способны распознавать закономерности в больших объемах данных. И доступные данные-в базах данных, файловых системах, системах сообщений и веб-сайтах-постоянно растут. Единственный способ получить полную ценность всех этих данных - использовать компьютерные инструменты для поиска полезной информации.\n\nИздательская компания HarperCollins использует компьютерную систему для отслеживания продаж книг, чтобы печатать достаточно книг, чтобы удовлетворить спрос. Таким образом, он не будет пойман с большими запасами непроданных книг в магазинах, которые издатели должны забрать обратно. После всего лишь года работы новая система помогла HarperCollins снизить доходность непроданных экземпляров своих самых популярных книг с более чем 30 процентов до примерно 10 процентов. Каждый процентный пункт представляет собой миллионы долларов сбережений.\n\nИспользование программного обеспечения для поиска полезных шаблонов в больших объемах данных называется интеллектуальным анализом данных. Это может помочь предсказать, будут ли покупатели покупать товар из-за их возраста, пола, родного города и других характеристик. Он также может идентифицировать клиентов с похожим поведением при совершении покупок и клиентов со специфическими вкусами, чтобы обеспечить улучшенное индивидуальное обслуживание. Австралийская медицинская компания использовала интеллектуальный анализ данных для отслеживания моделей покупок и обнаружила мошенничество на 10 миллионов долларов.\n\nЧаще всего интеллектуальный анализ данных используется для маркетинга баз данных, в котором компании анализируют данные, чтобы выявить вкусы клиентов, а затем делают предложения определенным группам людей. Например, American Airlines использует информацию о двадцати шести миллионах участников своей программы частых полетов - таких как компании по прокату автомобилей, отели и рестораны, которыми они пользуются, - для разработки целевых маркетинговых мероприятий, которые позволили сэкономить более 100 миллионов долларов.\n\nИнтеллектуальный анализ данных является частью системы управления взаимоотношениями с клиентами (CRM), в которой информационные технологии помогают компаниям управлять отношениями с клиентами индивидуально, а не все вместе. Используя паттерны, выявленные с помощью интеллектуального анализа данных, вы можете представить свои продукты клиенту таким образом, который, скорее всего, повысит вашу ценность для клиента и его ценность для вас. Экономия средств достигается за счет более точных моделей клиентов, и поэтому количество рассылок сокращается. Прямая маркетинговая кампания для чего-то вроде кредитных карт, например, обычно приносит доход около 2 процентов. Mellon Bank USA в 1997 году имел целевую аудиторию в 200 000 новых клиентов,что обычно означало рассылку до 10 миллионов человек. Вместо этого банк использовал интеллектуальный анализ данных для создания моделей наиболее вероятных новых клиентов. Тогда банк смог достичь своей цели в 200 000 новых клиентов с почтовой рассылкой в 2 миллиона, а не в 10 миллионов. В дополнение к снижению затрат, каждый новый клиент был в три раза выгоднее, чем обычно, потому что интеллектуальный анализ данных был нацелен на клиентов, чьи потребности лучше всего соответствовали услугам Mellon Bank.\n\nТакая персонализация глубоко повлияет на все формы рекламы. По мере того как цифровое телевидение становится все более популярным, а электронные книги становятся предпочтительным способом чтения журналов и газет, почти вся реклама будет переходить от массовой рекламы к персонализированной. Рекламные ролики, которые появляются на экране, будут отличаться в зависимости от того, кто на них смотрит; разные районы или даже разные дома в одном и том же районе могут видеть разные рекламные ролики. Крупные компании могут стать более эффективными со своей рекламой, а небольшие компании могут впервые рассмотреть рекламу на телевидении и в журналах. Сегодня многие виды рекламы слишком дороги для любой, кроме истинно массовой продукции. Скоро даже местный бакалейщик сможет позволить себе рекламу для людей, живущих рядом с магазином.\n\nТаргетированная реклама должна радовать клиентов. Они с большей вероятностью увидят рекламу, имеющую к ним отношение. Некоторые люди могут быть обеспокоены тем, что рекламодатели имеют слишком много информации о них, но программное обеспечение позволит людям раскрывать только ту информацию, которую они хотят раскрыть. Например, большинство людей не возражали бы, если бы рекламодателям давали шаблоны просмотра. Большинство постоянных читателей специализированных журналов - будь то спорт, еда, наука, садоводство или автомобили-смотрят на рекламу так же внимательно, как и на статьи. Если вы смотрите телевизор таким же образом, в основном для одного или двух интересов, вы, вероятно, не будете возражать против просмотра рекламных роликов, которые концентрируются на этих интересах.\n\nСегодня большинство систем интеллектуального анализа данных стоят довольно дорого - от 25 000 до 150 000 долларов для малого или среднего бизнеса и до миллионов долларов для крупного клиента, такого как Wal-Mart. Пять лет назад одна страховая компания потратила 10 миллионов долларов на систему интеллектуального анализа данных. Босс сказал, что он знает, что может получить те же результаты за гораздо меньшие деньги с сегодняшней технологией, но преимущества стоили инвестиций.\n\nЭто замечание указывает на ценность интеллектуального анализа данных, но эти высокие цены отражают старые времена сложного программного обеспечения, в котором только крупнейшие организации, используя много сотрудников или нанимая специалистов, могли хорошо использовать данные. С ростом конкуренции в нашей информационной экономике данные о клиентах становятся все более важным активом. Каждая компания и каждый работник, работающий в сфере знаний, должны стараться получить максимальную отдачу от информационных активов компании. Эти новые пользователи не могут позволить себе большие бюджеты баз данных или специализированных экспертов по базам данных.\n\nК счастью, по мере того, как системы интеллектуального анализа данных станут доступны для ПК, вы увидите, что цены резко упадут, а использование интеллектуального анализа данных взорвется в компаниях и отделах всех размеров. Скоро каждая компания сможет проводить тот анализ, который раньше был зарезервирован для самых богатых организаций.\n\nНаибольшая ценность интеллектуального анализа данных будет заключаться в том, чтобы помочь компаниям выбрать правильные продукты для создания и правильный способ их оценки. Компании смогут посмотреть на различные варианты упаковки и цены, чтобы увидеть, какие из них наиболее привлекательны для клиентов и выгодны для них самих. Эти возможности представляют особый интерес для компаний, продающих информационные продукты. В отличие от автомобиля или кресла, такие продукты, как страхование, финансовые услуги и книги, стоят гораздо дороже, чем их производство, и имеют ценность, фиксируемую больше потребителем, чем физической стоимостью товаров. Секрет успеха информационных продуктов заключается в понимании особенностей и покупательских привычек ваших наиболее вероятных клиентов.\n\nСила интеллектуального анализа данных поможет компаниям решить, как приобретать новых клиентов, кому продавать, как оценивать свои продукты и как привлекать отдельных клиентов. Чтобы использовать эту информацию для создания новых идей по упаковке и ценообразованию, видеть новые продукты в шаблонах компьютерных результатов и разрабатывать новые захватывающие предложения, необходимы творческие способности и навыки человека. Чем лучше инструмент, тем более творческими они могут быть.\n\nМенеджеры должны инвестировать в передовые инструменты, которые помогают людям работать. Вы должны выделять от 3 до 4 процентов от зарплаты ваших работников умственного труда, чтобы убедиться, что у них есть лучшие инструменты, которые позволяют людям использовать свою энергию для творческих реакций на паттерны и тенденции, выявленные компьютером. Использование информации для разработки новых продуктов и услуг, а также для более тесного сотрудничества с партнерами и клиентами всегда будет оставаться исключительно человеческой задачей.\n\nПовысьте свой корпоративный IQ.\n\nКак и реинжиниринг до него, \"управление знаниями\" получило так много значений, что иногда кажется, что оно означает все, что кто-то хочет. Регулярно появляются новостные статьи на эту тему. Консалтинговые компании и веб-сайты специализируются на управлении знаниями, а в 1998 году появился журнал\" Управление знаниями\". Если репортеры поговорят с компанией, занимающейся базами данных, они обнаружат, что управление знаниями-это новейшая вещь в базах данных. Если журналисты общаются с сетевой компанией, они обнаруживают, что управление знаниями означает будущее сетей. Но как общая концепция-собирать и систематизировать информацию, передавать ее людям, которые в ней нуждаются, и постоянно совершенствовать информацию посредством анализа и совместной работы - управление знаниями полезно.\n\nТак что давайте сначала проясним пару вещей. Управление знаниями, как я здесь выражаюсь, не является программным продуктом или категорией программного обеспечения. Управление знаниями даже не начинается с технологии. Она начинается с бизнес-целей и процессов и понимания необходимости обмена информацией. Управление знаниями - это не что иное, как управление информационным потоком, передача нужной информации людям, которые в ней нуждаются, чтобы они могли действовать быстро. А управление знаниями - это средство, а не цель.\n\nЦель состоит в том, чтобы повысить корпоративный IQ. В сегодняшней быстро изменяющейся ситуации на рынке, предприятие должно высоким корпоративным IQ, чтобы добиться успеха. Под корпоративным IQ я имею в виду не только наличие большого количества умных людей в вашей компании - хотя это помогает начать с умных людей.\n\nКорпоративный IQ-это показатель того, насколько легко ваша компания может широко делиться информацией и насколько хорошо люди в вашей организации могут опираться на идеи друг друга. Корпоративный IQ предполагает обмен как историческими, так и текущими знаниями. Работники в компании с высоким корпоративным IQ работают вместе эффективно, так что все ключевые люди в проекте хорошо информированы и полны энергии. Конечная цель состоит в том, чтобы команда разработала лучшие идеи из всей организации, а затем действовала с той же целью и концентрацией, что и один энтузиаст. Цифровой информационный поток может помочь группам функционировать подобно отдельным людям.\n\nВысшие руководители компании должны верить в обмен знаниями, иначе даже серьезные усилия по обмену знаниями потерпят неудачу. Лидеры также должны показать, что они сами не заперты во дворце, изолированы от всех остальных, но готовы взаимодействовать с сотрудниками. Жак (Jac) Насер, операционный президент Ford, каждую пятницу после обеда рассылает электронное письмо 89 000 сотрудников Ford по всему миру, делясь новостями недели-хорошими и плохими - со всеми. Никто не проверяет электронную почту. Он разговаривает прямо с сотрудниками. Он также читает сотни ответов, которые получает каждый месяц, и назначает члена своей команды, чтобы ответить на любой, который нуждается в ответе.\n\nЯ не рассылаю еженедельные отчеты, но рассылаю по электронной почте сотрудникам по всему миру важные темы. Как и Джак Насер, я читаю всю электронную почту, которую мне присылают сотрудники, и передаю людям информацию для действий. Я нахожу электронную почту, которую мне присылают люди, удивительно хорошим способом оставаться в курсе отношений и проблем, затрагивающих многих людей, работающих в Microsoft.\n\nКогда бизнес-лидеры создают атмосферу, которая поощряет командную работу и обмен знаниями, им необходимо создать конкретные проекты по обмену знаниями в рамках всей организации и сделать обмен знаниями ключевой частью самой работы, а не дополнительной, которую можно безопасно игнорировать. Тогда лидеры должны быть уверены, что люди, которые делятся знаниями, будут вознаграждены. Старая поговорка\" Знание-сила \" иногда заставляет людей держать Знание при себе. Они считают, что это делает их более ценными для компании. Сила приходит не от знания, которое хранится, а от знания, которым делятся. Ценности и система вознаграждения компании должны отражать эту идею.\n\nУправление знаниями может помочь любому бизнесу в четырех основных областях: планирование, обслуживание клиентов, обучение и совместная работа над проектами. Если вы еще не занимались управлением знаниями в своей компании, подумайте о том, чтобы выбрать одну или две области, в которых можно начать проекты по управлению знаниями. Вы можете использовать успех своих проектов в этих областях для поощрения проектов по управлению знаниями в других областях вашего бизнеса. В течение нескольких лет все ведущие компании достигнут высокого уровня цифрового обмена знаниями.\n\nОбмен знаниями может помочь в планировании бренда в разных странах. В 1980-х годах Coca-Cola установила всемирную коммуникацию со своей собственной системой электронной почты, но она рассматривала ее как расходы, которые нужно контролировать, а не как инструмент для улучшения бизнеса. Когда это изменилось, все системы и функции стали совместимыми во всем мире, и самым большим потребителем технологий стал маркетинг, а не финансы. Маркетинговый инструмент Inform (информация для маркетинга) рассматривает данные о потребительских предпочтениях в каждой стране. Из данных о продажах он может сказать вам, какие типы людей в маленьком городке в Южной Африке пьют Спрайт каждый день и сколько они выпили в марте прошлого года.\n\nУправление знаниями может быть использовано для более быстрого реагирования на запросы клиентов. Компания Yamanouchi Pharmaceuticals, имеющая 3,9 миллиарда долларов, является третьей по величине фармацевтической компанией в Японии. Они и Microsoft сделали веб-информационные системы важной частью повышения качества и скорости ответов на технические вопросы клиентов. Служба поддержки продуктов компании Yamanouchi может немедленно ответить примерно на половину вопросов, поступающих от врачей. Чтобы найти ответы на более сложные вопросы, они используют веб-систему поддержки информационного центра продуктов Yamanouchi или PRINCESS. При этом используется электронный поиск по продукту и по слову. Ответы вводятся в систему для использования в следующий раз. В 1998 году PRINCESS была предоставлена в распоряжение отдела продаж. Следующим шагом могло бы стать предоставление ее в распоряжение самих врачей.\n\nОнлайн-обучение-это еще одна область, где управление знаниями может сделать вещи быстрее и лучше. Американский веб обучает людей использовать технологии в бизнесе. Он разработал SiteCast для интерактивных семинаров. Онлайн-обучение было очень популярно в Microsoft. В 1998 году в интернете обучалось вдвое больше людей, чем в классе.\n\nЦифровой информационный поток также может помочь в разработке продукта. В набиско есть одни из самых популярных продуктов в мире. Около трети его новых продуктов пользуются успехом во всем мире, треть делает все хорошо, а еще треть отстает. Эти результаты лучше, чем в среднем, но с ростом конкуренции Nabisco решила больше использовать информационные технологии в процессе разработки продукта. Набиско не нуждался в процессе разработки нового продукта. Технология была необходима, чтобы помочь команде разработчиков продукта общаться друг с другом лучше и быстрее. Система под названием Journey теперь организует информацию, которая раньше была в любом месте на любом столе в офисе. Всем людям, участвующим в разработке любого нового продукта, достаточно лишь нажать на него, чтобы найти всю информацию о нем. Например, Nabisco разработала новый продукт, и что-то в нем изменилось. Люди, написавшие описание продукта на этикетке, увидели изменение в интернете и немедленно изменили этикетку.\n\nУправление знаниями-это причудливый термин для обозначения простой идеи. Вы управляете данными, документами и усилиями людей. Ваша цель должна состоять в том, чтобы улучшить то, как люди работают вместе, обмениваются идеями, иногда спорят и развивают идеи друг друга, а затем действуют вместе для достижения общей цели. Роль босса в повышении корпоративного IQ компании заключается в создании атмосферы, способствующей обмену знаниями и совместной работе, в приоритете тех областей, в которых обмен знаниями наиболее ценен, в предоставлении цифровых инструментов, которые делают обмен знаниями возможным, и в вознаграждении людей за вклад в полный поток информации.\n\nБольшие победы требуют больших рисков.\n\nЧтобы быть лидером рынка, у вас должны быть большие цели. Вы не можете просто смотреть на прошлое или текущее состояние рынка. Вы также должны посмотреть, куда это может пойти, и куда это может пойти при определенных обстоятельствах, а затем направить свою компанию в соответствии с вашими лучшими прогнозами. Чтобы выиграть по-крупному, иногда приходится идти на большой риск. Большие ставки означают большие неудачи, а также успехи. Сегодня, оглядываясь назад, легко поверить, что нынешний успех Microsoft был неизбежен. Но в то время, когда мы делали большие ставки - в том числе начинали компанию как первую фирму по разработке программного обеспечения для персональных компьютеров, - большинство людей думали, что мы потерпим неудачу.\n\nМногие ведущие компании не решались перейти на новые технологии, опасаясь разрушить успех существующих. Они получили тяжелый урок. Если вы не пойдете на риск раньше, то упадете на рынке позже. Однако, если вы делаете большие ставки, только некоторые из этих рисков должны быть успешными, чтобы обеспечить ваше будущее. Текущие цели Microsoft включают в себя повышение производительности ПК за пределами всех существующих систем, разработку компьютеров, которые \"видят, слушают и учатся\", и создание программного обеспечения для питания новых персональных компьютеров-компаньонов. Эти планы являются ответом Microsoft на будущее, в котором все машины будут использовать цифровые технологии и должны работать друг с другом. Независимо от того, увенчаются ли эти планы успехом или нет, ясно одно: мы должны пойти на этот риск, чтобы иметь долгосрочное будущее.\n\nВ новой отрасли риск естественен. Компьютерная индустрия находится в таком же развитии, как автомобили в 1910-х годах и самолеты в 1930-х. Эти отрасли прошли через революционные и часто беспорядочные технические и деловые изменения, прежде чем они стали стабильными, и то же самое происходит в компьютерной индустрии.\n\nРазвивайте процессы, которые дают людям власть.\n\nБизнес имеет процессы, которые похожи на основные биологические процессы, которые поддерживают нашу жизнь. Одним из таких процессов является функция, определяющая причину существования компании - например, производственный процесс. Эта функция должна быть такой же эффективной и надежной, как биение сердца.\n\nВторым видом автоматического процесса в бизнесе является административный-процесс получения платежей, оплаты счетов и заработной платы, например. Административные процессы так же важны для бизнеса, как дыхание. Если основные операционные процессы вашего бизнеса терпят неудачу, ваша компания терпит неудачу.\n\nПоскольку основные операционные процессы так важны - и так дороги-большинство крупных компаний начали вкладывать значительные средства в их автоматизацию много лет назад. Но слишком часто автоматизированные процессы были изолированы друг от друга. Общая эффективность была далеко не так хороша, как могла бы быть. До недавнего времени, например, при изготовлении некоторых деталей самолета фактически использовалось только 10 процентов исходного металла. Производственный процесс был усовершенствован на многих отдельных этапах, а не в целом. Там было огромное количество отходов.\n\nВ других разделах я говорил о деловых операциях, таких как финансовые и другие административные системы. В этом разделе я сосредоточусь на производственных процессах. Автоматизированный производственный процесс необходим, но недостаточно сам по себе, чтобы сделать компанию конкурентоспособной сегодня. Хорошая цифровая нервная система может помочь вам превратить ваших сотрудников в работников умственного труда, превратив основные производственные процессы вашей компании в конкурентное преимущество.\n\nВо-первых, вы должны использовать информационные технологии, чтобы лучше понять внутреннюю работу самого процесса, чтобы сделать его более эффективным и более чутким к меняющимся обстоятельствам. Корпорация Entergy из Нового Орлеана повысила эффективность своих электростанций с помощью новой системы управления технологическими процессами. Это позволяет операторам установок регулировать эффективность установки и анализировать тенденции производительности по мере их возникновения. Операторы могут фактически заглянуть внутрь систем завода, чтобы точно понять, как работают машины, и решить, может ли незначительное изменение или ремонт сэкономить дорогостоящий ремонт позже.\n\nИнтеллектуальная система на базе ПК гарантирует, что наиболее приоритетные элементы будут отремонтированы в первую очередь. Система управления процессом фактически показывает операторам стоимость снижения эффективности, если температура, например, на десять градусов ниже, чем должна быть. Прилагая долларовую цифру к оперативным решениям, Entergy превращает своих операторов в деловых людей, предоставляя им информацию, необходимую для эффективного управления их подразделениями, и делая их гораздо более ответственными за свои решения. А поскольку производственные затраты на заводы Entergy доступны руководящему персоналу в электронном виде поминутно, компания может повысить свою прибыль, постоянно перемещая производство электроэнергии на те агрегаты, которые обеспечивают наиболее экономичную энергию.\n\nЗатем вы должны иметь возможность получать данные из вашего производственного процесса для информирования других бизнес-систем. Компания \"Степан\", производящая чистящие средства, разработала систему управления технологическими процессами, которая позволила увеличить производительность завода на 300 процентов и сэкономить компании миллионы долларов за счет более эффективного использования оборудования. Но повышение эффективности не так ценно для Степана, как то, как его система управления технологическими процессами справляется с меняющимися требованиями клиентов.\n\nНаконец, и это самое важное, вам нужно передать данные из вашего производственного процесса производственным работникам, чтобы они могли улучшить качество самого продукта. Если вы предоставите правильную технологию, чтобы помочь производственным работникам сделать быстрый анализ, они превратят данные в информацию, которая поможет вам улучшить дизайн и уменьшить количество ошибок. Развитие цифровой нервной системы позволяет вам дать больше энергии как можно большему числу ваших работников.\n\nВ новой организации работник больше не является частью машины, а является разумной частью общего процесса. Некоторые металлурги теперь должны знать математику, чтобы вычислять углы по компьютеризированным чертежам. Компании по очистке воды обучают работников производственных линий компьютерным измерениям и математике. Новые цифровые копировальные аппараты требуют от обслуживающего персонала понимания компьютеров и интернета, а не только умения обращаться с отверткой.\n\nЛюди по-прежнему играют важную роль в оперативных процессах, которые должны постоянно совершенствоваться и адаптироваться к меняющимся обстоятельствам. Эффективная производственная линия нуждается в людях-хорошо информированных, ответственных. Организуя задачи в процессы, мы даем работникам больше ответственности. Компьютеры возьмут на себя некоторые работы, но это будет означать, что многие другие работы больше не будут скучными.\n\nКогда люди могут сосредоточиться на целых процессах, их работа становится более интересной и сложной. Простые задачи исчезнут, будут автоматизированы или встроены в более масштабный процесс. Работа, которая включает в себя повторение одной и той же задачи снова и снова, - это именно то, что лучше всего удается компьютерам и другим машинам, а человеческие работники плохо приспособлены и почти всегда ненавидят. Управление процессом вместо выполнения задачи делает человека работником знаний, а хороший цифровой информационный поток позволяет работникам знаний играть свои уникальные роли.\n\nБольшинство компаний готовы предоставить информационные инструменты своим высокооплачиваемым офисным сотрудникам,чья работа-информационная. Энтерги и Степан доказывают, что построение систем вокруг информационных потоков и предоставление информационных инструментов линейным работникам также может обеспечить огромную ценность. Entergy меняет все свои ключевые бизнес-процессы и продвигает информацию и принятие решений на операционный уровень. Степан использует информацию для управления своими заводами в целом, чтобы адаптироваться к меняющимся потребностям клиентов. Обе эти компании применяют управление знаниями к бизнес-операциям для анализа и улучшения производства, качества и частоты отказов. Цифровые инструменты привносят больше интеллекта в их бизнес-операции.\n\nДайте своим работникам лучшую работу с лучшими инструментами, и вы обнаружите, что ваши сотрудники станут более ответственными и привнесут больше интеллекта в свою работу. В цифровую эпоху вам нужно сделать работников умственного труда из каждого сотрудника, которого вы можете.\n\nГлава четвертая.\n\nСпециальные Проекты.\n\nНикакая система здравоохранения не является островом.\n\nНесколько лет назад новый сотрудник Microsoft был вызван обратно в свой родной штат, потому что его мать перенесла легкий инсульт. Когда она достаточно поправилась, чтобы выписаться из больницы, Миссис Джонс (не настоящее ее имя) осталась с сестрой, пока ее сын завершал планы по переезду ее к нему. Миссис Джонс в значительной степени выздоровела, но больше никогда не могла жить самостоятельно, и ее периоды хорошего здоровья прерывались больницами для лечения все более и более серьезных проблем.\n\nМедицинские события последних двух лет жизни миссис Джонс показывают лучшие и худшие стороны американской системы здравоохранения. Она получила хороший уход, включая ряд очень новых методов лечения, из трех разных больниц и более дюжины врачей в двух разных штатах. По мере того как ее физические способности снижались, ее семья из среднего класса смогла найти хорошие учреждения, обеспечивающие большую степень ухода. \"Медикэр\" и ее собственная частная страховка оплачивали большую часть счетов; она и ее семья оплачивали остальное. Ее многочисленные врачи, медсестры и другие воспитатели были профессиональными и добрыми.\n\nНо система была далека от совершенства. Когда миссис Джонс уехала из первой больницы в родной город своей сестры, находившийся в пятидесяти километрах отсюда, сбой связи между врачами означал, что ее лекарство поддерживалось в полной силе, в то время как Миссис Джонс должна была принимать уменьшающуюся дозу. К тому времени, когда она прибыла на Северо-Запад, побочные эффекты высокой дозы привели к тому, что ей пришлось немедленно лечь в больницу. Поскольку ее записи не пришли вместе с ней, пришлось повторить ряд дорогостоящих тестов.\n\nТо же самое произошло, когда год спустя она сменила больницу. Ее заключительное трехнедельное пребывание в больнице, которое не предполагало никакой операции, все еще стоило 25 000 долларов. В какой-то момент врач перепутал ее с другим пациентом и сказал ее следующему врачу, что ее недавнее пребывание в больнице было \"злоупотреблением системой\". Это было меньше чем за неделю до смерти миссис Джонс.\n\nЭти и другие проблемы продолжались, несмотря на то, что у миссис Джонс была семья, которая помогала ей работать в запутанных медицинских и социальных службах. Ее сын и невестка по очереди часами стояли в очереди в одном агентстве или разговаривали по телефону с другим. И прошел год, прежде чем они смогли убедить одну больницу прекратить выставлять им счета за услуги, которые были оплачены полностью.\n\nИз-за большого количества больниц, врачей, медицинских учреждений, государственных и частных агентств, связанных с этим, объем бумажной работы был огромным. Подумайте о количестве людей, которых представляли эти документы. На каждого врача и медсестру, которые лечили Миссис Джонс, приходилось не меньше дюжины человек в разных организациях. Это было похоже на старомодную военную операцию. На каждого солдата в тылу приходилось по двадцать человек, управлявших администрацией.\n\nПо оценкам большинства экспертов, от 20 до 30 процентов ежегодных триллионных расходов американской системы здравоохранения тратится на бумажную работу. В больницах это число может достигать 40-40 процентов. Одна неделя пребывания может создать до ста листов бумаги. И, что еще хуже, около 13 процентов от одного до двух миллиардов претензий каждый год в Соединенных Штатах возвращаются за ошибки.\n\nБумажная волокита и сложность возросли даже тогда, когда индустрия здравоохранения США перешла на \"управляемый уход\" в попытке сократить расходы, предотвратить мошенничество и обеспечить надлежащий уход. При управляемом уходе организация заключает контракт с группой врачей на оказание медицинских услуг с целью достижения управляемых результатов и за фиксированную плату. Более 160 миллионов человек в Соединенных Штатах были охвачены планами управляемого ухода в начале 1997 года-последнего года, по которому имеются данные.\n\nВрачи понимают необходимость контролировать расходы, но чувствуют себя похороненными в правилах и слоях управления. Они боятся, что их медицинские возможности могут быть ограничены и что уход за пациентами может пострадать. Они также усложнили ситуацию, рассматривая файлы пациентов как деловые записи и часто не решаясь поделиться ими с конкурирующими врачами. И они в основном были против компьютеров, хотя это в основном потому, что ранние медицинские системы были неуклюжими и дорогими. Как ни странно, управляемая забота, которую многие врачи любят ненавидеть, может стать основной силой, которая распространяет информационные системы на уход за пациентами и возвращает контроль над уходом за пациентами врачам. Когда вы предоставляете врачам достаточно клинически полезной информации, они видят преимущества и просят больше.\n\nПациенты, тем временем, осознают, насколько больше информации доступно им в интернете и как эта информация дает им чувство контроля и ответственности в поддержании собственного здоровья.\n\nКлинические преимущества также побудили руководителей здравоохранения настаивать на совершенствовании информационных систем. До сих пор здравоохранение использовало только 2-3 процента своих доходов на информационные технологии, по сравнению с 15 процентами банковской отрасли. Хотя здравоохранение является высокотехнологичной областью, эта технология применяется к индивидуальным системам лечения, а не к информационным потокам. Часто используемое информационное программное обеспечение не предназначено для работы с другими информационными программами, несмотря на все области здравоохранения, которые должны обмениваться данными: лаборатория, банк крови, картографические системы, биллинговые системы и машины, которые следят за пациентами.\n\nОрганизациям приходилось создавать специальные интерфейсы между различными программами. Типичная организация здравоохранения может иметь сотни таких интерфейсов. В настоящее время одна организация управляет 1800 различными интерфейсами. Эта сложность является одной из причин, по которой организации здравоохранения обычно требуется два года, чтобы купить новую систему, и еще два года, чтобы установить ее-слишком медленно по любым стандартам.\n\nСегодня ситуация более обнадеживающая. Правительство США приняло законы, которые требуют определения стандарта для электронных финансовых и административных операций, включая компьютерные записи пациентов. Улучшение обработки информации в медицинских организациях станет обязательным требованием в будущем. Некоторые организации здравоохранения, признавая, что потребности их пациентов не могут ждать, демонстрируют сильное лидерство. Они доказывают, что цифровая нервная система может быть чрезвычайно полезна во всех областях ухода за пациентами: от экстренных служб до стационарного лечения, поддержания связи с пациентами и долгосрочного анализа тенденций.\n\nПредставьте себе, что у вас есть система здравоохранения в вашем местном сообществе, построенная из цифровых частей. Интеллектуальная система экстренной помощи быстро доставит вас в больницу, и вся важная информация о вашей истории болезни и текущем состоянии здоровья немедленно поступит в компьютеры больницы. Врач использует сенсорный экран, клавиатуру или ручку, чтобы заказать ваше лечение. Цифровые инструкции отправляются в лаборатории. Компьютеры поставляют лабораторные результаты в электронном виде. Эти и другие отчеты находятся в интернете для удобного просмотра любым врачом, как на месте, так и вне его. Система будет сообщать врачам о любых возможных проблемах с лечением или отклонениях от утвержденного клинического пути. Выставление счетов осуществляется автоматически. Системы, обрабатывающие компьютерные сделки, обнаруживают мошенничество или необычное использование.\n\nВместо того чтобы тратить половину своего времени на бумажную работу, врачи и медсестры тратят почти все свое время на лечение вас и других своих пациентов. Результаты тестов и счета доходят до вас простым, понятным языком. Вся информация о вашем лечении и лекарствах автоматически оценивается в долгосрочной перспективе, чтобы помочь предотвратить проблемы.\n\nВаш уход после больницы также запланирован автоматически. Вы находите медицинскую информацию в интернете, и поэтому ваши встречи с медицинскими работниками более информированы, независимо от того, общаетесь ли вы с ними через Интернет, по электронной почте или встречаетесь лично. Вы используете электронную почту, чтобы задавать обычные вопросы своему врачу и получать напоминания о продолжающихся программах здравоохранения.\n\nКогда вы меняете планы здоровья, вся ваша история болезни идет с вами, а не теряется или следует за вами несколько месяцев спустя. Врачи используют ваш анамнез, чтобы определить тенденции в кровяном давлении, весе и других моделях, которые могут выявить серьезную развивающуюся проблему. Систематический медицинский анализ всего общества позволяет властям узнавать о любых тревожных тенденциях в области общественного здравоохранения гораздо раньше и точнее, чем это было возможно раньше.\n\nЕсли медицинские сообщества используют подход, основанный на компьютерных и веб-технологиях, такие способности не должны стоить целое состояние. ПК обеспечивают пошаговый подход с использованием стандартизированного программного обеспечения. В настоящее время ПК также используются для управления специализированными машинами, такими как анализаторы крови и тканей, что снижает их стоимость и позволяет обмениваться данными.\n\nПК достаточно мощны, чтобы обрабатывать сотни тысяч заявлений или запросов в час. Все вместе технологии, описанные в этой главе, обойдутся типичной организации здравоохранения менее чем в 5 миллионов долларов. Это немалая сумма, но она незначительна по сравнению с той суммой, которую большинство медицинских организаций тратят сегодня на бумажную работу и автономные компьютерные системы. С учетом того, что бумажная работа составляет от 20 до 30 процентов годового дохода системы здравоохранения США в размере 1 триллиона долларов, текущие расходы составляют от 200 до 300 миллиардов долларов в год - больше, чем весь доход многих стран.\n\nСегодня отсутствие информационных систем в кабинетах врачей является самым большим препятствием для улучшения ухода за пациентами. Только около 5% офисов в Соединенных Штатах используют компьютерные системы в своей клинической работе. Компьютеризация кабинета врача будет стоить от 10 000 до 50 000 долларов за каждый, но врачи могут быстро возместить затраты. Офис с пятью врачами в Хаммонде, штат Луизиана, инвестировал около 50 000 долларов в компьютерные системы для пациентов, которые облегчали врачам ввод данных; офис сэкономил 60 000 долларов в первый год только на расходах на набор текста.\n\nМедицинские работники приложат большие усилия для улучшения медицинского обслуживания с помощью цифровой информации. Технология доступна и сегодня. Инвестиции в общую инфраструктуру и инструменты позволят не только значительно сократить расходы, но и улучшить медицинское обслуживание для всех. Перемены будут вызваны двумя группами: пациентами, которые настаивают на том, чтобы быть лучше информированными и более вовлеченными в свое собственное здоровье, и медицинскими работниками, которые используют эти новые инструменты для обеспечения лучшего ухода. Вместе они будут использовать цифровую нервную систему, чтобы превратить острова здравоохранения в единый континент.\n\nВозьмите правительство к народу.\n\nПравительство, возможно, больше, чем любая другая организация, может извлечь выгоду из эффективности и улучшения обслуживания, которые вытекают из цифровых процессов. Развитые страны будут лидировать в создании безбумажных процессов для сокращения административных расходов. Развивающиеся страны смогут предоставлять новые услуги, не прибегая к неуклюжим бумажным методам.\n\nНо большинство правительств далеко отстают от бизнеса в использовании инструментов цифровой эпохи. Компании, переходящие на цифровые технологии, застряли со многими бумажными формами, потому что правительства еще не подключены к интернету. Причина этой задержки - отсутствие организационной цели. Поскольку в государственных процессах используется много бумаги и людей, в прошлом повышение их \"эффективности\" часто означало сокращение обслуживания. Обычно правительства запрещают агентствам закрывать какие-либо офисы, что просто заставляет их бороться за то, чтобы делать больше с меньшими затратами.\n\nВ то же время существует небольшое давление, чтобы обеспечить лучшее обслуживание. Граждане не могут сдать свой бизнес в другой налоговый орган или в Бюро регистрации транспортных средств. Государственные учреждения, как правило, концентрируются на собственных внутренних организационных потребностях, а не на широких потребностях граждан и бизнеса. В качестве примера рассмотрим документы, связанные с наймом поставщика услуг по уходу за детьми в Соединенных Штатах. Работодатель должен знать, что существует пять агентств, каждое из которых имеет свой набор форм. Это осложнение, а не желание избежать уплаты налогов, объясняет, почему так мало людей следуют правилам. В этом и многих других случаях для среднего гражданина правительство остается угрожающим узлом отдельных учреждений и правил.\n\nНо цифровые процессы и веб-образ жизни дают правительству возможность измениться так, чтобы оно было организовано вокруг граждан, а не администрации. Правительства могут предпринять пять основных шагов, чтобы помочь сделать цифровую эпоху реальностью в своих странах. Первые два связаны с улучшением государственных услуг; последние три связаны с созданием инфраструктуры, позволяющей предприятиям страны конкурировать в цифровую эпоху:\n\n1 Поставьте государственных служащих на электронную почту и избавьтесь от бумажной картотеки. Убедитесь, что вся информация внутри правительства является цифровой.\n\n2 Разместите государственные услуги в интернете с интерфейсом, предназначенным для пользователя. Публикуйте все в Интернете.\n\n3 привлечение инвестиций технологическими компаниями и стимулирование электронной коммерции, иногда с финансовой помощью, но чаще с помощью совместных проектов. Создать стандарт электронной идентификации предприятий и граждан.\n\n4 устраните правила, которые мешают индустрии связи эффективно работать. Поощрять крупные инвестиции в инфраструктуру связи.\n\n5 повышение квалификации граждан путем использования технологий в рамках систем образования и профессиональной подготовки на всех уровнях.\n\nПравительство, как и бизнес, может лучше использовать программные средства и электронную почту, чтобы получить гораздо больше выгод от инвестиций в технологии. В развитых странах многие государственные служащие и государственные чиновники уже имеют компьютеры на своих столах, а развивающиеся страны могут создать инфраструктуру ПК за небольшую плату. Использование только электронной почты способствует сотрудничеству между учреждениями и позволяет государственным служащим лучше реагировать на запросы. Некоторые американские политики начинают использовать электронную почту, чтобы поддерживать связь с гражданами, а национальный парламент Австралии использует цифровой рабочий поток, чтобы убедиться, что запросы выполняются.\n\nПравительствам необходимо принять решение об использовании цифровых информационных потоков вместо бумажных. Публикация в интернете должна быть стандартной. Печатные документы должны быть редкостью. Экономия была бы огромной. Только правительство США тратит один миллиард долларов ежегодно на печать документов, которые уже доступны в Интернете. Большинство копий этих документов предназначены для государственных служащих, чьи офисы уже находятся в сети. Большая часть печатных экземпляров оказывается в мусорном баке в столице страны. Веб-публикация всех правительственных документов может снизить затраты и значительно облегчить поиск информации. Цифровые системы также лучше подходят для сложных документов. Правительственное описание транспортного самолета, которое нужно компаниям, если они хотят участвовать в тендере на его строительство, весит больше, чем дом в печатном виде, но данные легко поместятся на пару компакт-дисков.\n\nОнлайн-подход делает больше, чем просто сокращает расходы на бумагу. Веб-технология позволяет правительствам обеспечить единую точку контакта для общественности, единое онлайн - \"лицо\" для структурирования информации в соответствии с тем, что важно для гражданина.\n\nВ некоторых шведских городах, например, веб-страницы организуют различные услуги от различных уровней власти. Граждане могут быстро найти паспортные столы, налоговые органы и офисы национального страхования. Они могут получать отчеты с публичных собраний и другие публичные документы. Они даже могут получать отчеты в режиме реального времени об общественном транспорте, основываясь на электронной информации от транспортных средств, либо используя Интернет, либо киоски. Киоск - это просто компьютер, предназначенный для общественного пользования.\n\nПоскольку интернет обеспечивает наилучший способ взаимодействия с правительством, все граждане должны использовать его, даже если у них самих нет компьютеров. Если электронные киоски, работающие как банковские банкоматы, разместить в почтовых отделениях, библиотеках, школах и других общественных зданиях, они могут помочь правительствам улучшить качество услуг при одновременном снижении стоимости доставки.\n\nОнлайн-системы наиболее полезны для граждан и наиболее эффективны для правительства, когда они имеют более чем одну цель. Правительства должны пересмотреть все свои отношения с гражданами, которые требуют от них стоять в очереди или заполнять бланки. Правительство должно объединить все задействованные ведомства для разработки единой системы управления всеми контактами с гражданами.\n\nИрландское правительство, используя почту, ирландскую почтовую службу, сделало это лучше всего. Почтовые киоски обрабатывают оплату счетов, выдают паспорта, выдают лицензии на транспортные средства, выплачивают пособия, предлагают сберегательные и инвестиционные планы-даже продают марки. Каждый киоск - это крошечная городская ратуша, освещающая работу полудюжины агентств. Поскольку многие из 1000 почтовых отделений An расположены в небольших городах с населением менее 2000 человек, киоски обслуживают 1,26 миллиона человек в неделю-половину населения Ирландии - и обрабатывают более 9 миллиардов долларов в год. Изменить или добавить новые операции очень просто.\n\nДля государственных сделок, подобных этим, как и для всех коммерческих сделок, безопасность имеет важное значение. Безопасность состоит из двух элементов: защита персональных данных во время их перемещения по сети и идентификация лица, осуществляющего операцию. Сегодня существует технология шифрования, которая достаточно сильна, чтобы защитить безопасность любого электронного движения в сети, но американский экспортный контроль над технологией шифрования ограничивает американские фирмы от внедрения ее в свои продукты. Поскольку это не удерживает технологию шифрования от рук преступников, индустрия программного обеспечения работает над тем, чтобы изменить мнение правительства США по этому вопросу. На практике шифрование, которое можно использовать, достаточно сильно, чтобы в большинстве случаев безопасность данных в сети не была слабым звеном. Электронные данные так же безопасны, как и данные в других формах.\n\nИдентификация пользователя не менее важна. Вы же не хотите, чтобы кто-то еще проник в ваши правительственные документы или на ваш банковский счет. Смарт-карты-это решение проблем с идентификацией личности, как и карты для банковских банкоматов. В Испании новая система киосков позволит любому желающему узнать общую информацию о социальных льготах, пройдя через сенсорное меню, но для поиска любой личной информации человеку нужна смарт-карта.\n\nХотя такие карты похожи на банковские карты, используемые во всем мире, некоторые люди обеспокоены тем, что правительство может собрать слишком много информации о гражданах. Некоторые страны имеют законы о конфиденциальности, которые запрещают одной карте или базе данных содержать всю информацию о гражданине, поэтому в некоторых странах будет две карты: одна для финансовых операций с бизнесом или правительством, а другая для здравоохранения.\n\nШироко доступная информация и возможность размещать большое количество информации на смарт-картах заставят общества снова взглянуть на вопрос о том, как можно использовать информацию. Должен ли любой работодатель иметь возможность видеть полицейское досье кандидата на работу? Или просто такие организации, как школы, которые нанимают людей, тесно работающих с детьми? В конце концов, это политические вопросы, а не технологические. Каждая страна должна будет принять решение о том, какие виды личной информации будут разрешены на смарт-картах. Даже если их использование ограничивается только идентификацией личности, повышение эффективности и предотвращение мошенничества стоят вложенных средств. В Лондоне 200 пробных киосков такой системы, как \"Почта\", сократили мошенничество с выплатой пособий на 750 000 фунтов в первый год. При установке во всех 1500 почтовых отделениях киоски, как ожидается, сэкономят 150 миллионов фунтов стерлингов в год.\n\nМенее развитые страны могут считать, что цифровой подход к управлению недосягаем, но страны без систем могут начать все сначала с новой технологии, которая будет дешевле, чем ручной подход. Развитые страны имеют более старые системы,которые часто должны быть объединены.\n\nПримеры со всего мира ясно показывают, что многие из достижений происходят в небольших правительствах-небольших странах и городах, округах и провинциях, а также на государственном уровне больших стран. Меньшие правительства менее сложны, и они могут экспериментировать и разрабатывать решения в меньшем масштабе. Для более крупных правительств урок состоит в том, чтобы начать с небольших проектов, чтобы развить необходимые навыки и посмотреть, как реагируют граждане. Сначала сосредоточьтесь на проектах, которые непосредственно касаются граждан, и особенно на тех, которые избавляют общественность от организационных сложностей.\n\nОкруг Кинг в моем родном штате Вашингтон, вероятно, опережает многие правительства по количеству информации, которую он публикует в интернете,но округ еще не упаковывает информацию или операции просто. Чтобы получить разрешение на строительство в сельской местности округа Кинг, Вы должны получить информацию из многих источников: телефонная книга, телефонные звонки в офис округа, два или три печатных документа и веб-сайт департамента. Единый хорошо структурированный веб-сайт со всей информацией и ссылками, включающими все этапы процесса получения разрешения на строительство, устранит большинство сложностей и может автоматизировать некоторые этапы.\n\nЭкономия от новых цифровых систем составит значительную часть бюджета каждого правительства. Американские военные недавно обнаружили, что они тратят больше денег на обработку и утверждение разрешений на поездки, 2,3 миллиарда долларов, чем на сами поездки, 2 миллиарда долларов. Государственный бюджет США составляет 27 миллиардов долларов на продовольственные талоны, 25 миллиардов долларов на социальные пособия и 13 миллиардов долларов на государственное жилье. Все эти программы имеют чрезвычайно дорогие бумажные административные системы, которые съедают 30 процентов денег. Хорошие цифровые системы могут подтолкнуть это ниже 10 процентов.\n\nГраждане все больше осознают мощь интернета и больше не желают принимать идею о том, что Государственная служба должна быть медленной или запутанной. Ни один клиент не станет стоять в очереди в течение двух часов, чтобы получить обслуживание от частного бизнеса. Почему рабочий должен стоять в очереди в течение двух часов в правительственном офисе и терять два часа зарплаты, когда с помощью интернета он может получить лицензию или оплатить свои гонорары и быть на работе вовремя?\n\nОдно только правительство, создав ключевые сервисы вокруг Интернета, даст большую причину для перехода граждан к веб-образу жизни. Если правительство, как правило, крупнейший \"бизнес\" в любой стране, является лидером в использовании технологий, оно автоматически поднимет технические навыки страны и приведет к переходу на информационный рынок. Построение информационной экономики сделает все компании в стране более конкурентоспособными. Информационный век выигрывает от того, что в него вовлекается больше людей. По мере того как все больше и больше стран присоединяются к этому процессу, его значение возрастает для всех стран. Мировая торговля будет осуществляться в цифровом формате.\n\nНи одно правительство не может сразу внедрить полностью цифровой подход, но каждое правительство может начать сейчас с решительных первых шагов, которые принесут пользу гражданам и заставят их почувствовать, что правительство работает на них. Главный принцип должен заключаться в том, чтобы гражданам никогда больше не приходилось заполнять множество формуляров или ходить во множество мест, чтобы получить информацию.\n\nКак сказал один правительственный чиновник в разговоре о своем новом веб-сайте, который позволяет людям скачивать в интернете столетние записи округа, \"люди могут сказать, когда вы пытаетесь помочь. Они знают разницу между правительственным учреждением, пытающимся им помочь, и тем, которое просто мешает\".\n\nСоздавать сетевые образовательные сообщества.\n\nПК могут дать больше власти учителям и студентам, чем любая другая группа работников умственного труда. Студенты являются чистыми \"работниками знаний\", поскольку обучение-это все о приобретении знаний. Учителя смогут использовать Интернет, чтобы делиться друг с другом и позволить студентам исследовать предмет по-новому. При наличии прочной инфраструктуры некоторые школы уже получают выгоду от использования ПК в классе. Многие школы изо всех сил пытаются найти ресурсы для этих новых инструментов, но умные программы показали, что есть вознаграждение за усилия.\n\nУспех ПК как учебного инструмента требует участия учителя. Без подготовки учителей и превращения ПК в центр учебной программы они не будут иметь большого эффекта. Многие ПК ушли в компьютерные \"лаборатории\", где они сидят, редко используются. Школы должны перейти от рассмотрения ПК как предмета - преподавания технологии-к включению его во все области учебной программы: обучение с использованием технологии. Все больше и больше школ в настоящее время показывают, что ПК, используемые в качестве инструментов обучения, могут оказывать сильное влияние.\n\nВ независимом школьном округе Вестерн-Хайтс, расположенном к западу от Оклахома-Сити, штат Оклахома, учителя были полны энтузиазма, когда округ проводил обучение летом, прежде чем ввести ПК. Более 200 из 230 его учителей записались. Большинство учителей очень любят учиться, и они будут в восторге от всего, что поможет детям учиться. Чего учителя не хотят, так это быть брошенными во что-то, о чем они не имели возможности узнать и освоиться.\n\nВестерн-Хайтс-небольшой семишкольный округ с умеренной налоговой базой для промышленности. Студенческое население представляет собой смесь культур. Около 65 процентов детей имеют право на бесплатные или льготные школьные обеды, потому что они родом из семей с более низкими доходами. Это не тот школьный округ, который, как вы могли бы ожидать, возглавит продвижение в информационную эпоху. Но за последние три года округ трижды голосовал за то, чтобы потратить в общей сложности более 6,8 миллиона долларов местных средств на создание, возможно, ведущей технологической образовательной программы в стране. Сообщество рассматривает инвестиции как единственный способ разорвать порочный круг бедности, который может заманить этих детей в ловушку, если они окажутся неподготовленными к цифровому миру.\n\nПК может стать мощным новым учебным пособием для учителей. Они находят, что могут сделать детей более заинтересованными в уроках, включив фотографии, фильмы и ссылки на интернет-страницы. Один учитель в Вестерн-Хайтс каждый день начинает свой урок со свежих новостей из интернета. Компьютеры - это часть жизни каждого учителя в классе Вестерн Хайтс. Учителя также используют электронную почту для общения друг с другом по общим вопросам. Им не нужно ждать районных собраний, которые проходят пару раз в год. Они могут обратиться к коллегам-учителям с вопросами и быстро получить ответы.\n\n\"Люди могут не осознавать, насколько одиноки учителя в классе\", - говорит Джо Китченс из отдела школ в Вестерн-Хайтс. - Большинство учителей целыми днями остаются за закрытыми дверями. У них мало времени для обмена опытом или взаимодействия с другими учителями. Есть только несколько раз в году, когда они могут собраться вместе. Электронная почта останавливает их изоляцию\". Он также шутит, что учителя могут жаловаться ему больше, чем раньше. Они ожидают, что он немедленно ответит на их вопросы по электронной почте.\n\nВажным способом использования преимуществ инвестиций в технологии является использование школьной инфраструктуры на благо всего общества. Базовые компьютерные навыки - это один из видов образования, который может быть применен в любой работе. В большинстве стран одна из каждых десяти вакансий в сфере информационных технологий (ИТ) не заполнена. В ближайшие несколько лет Соединенным Штатам и Европе потребуется более полумиллиона новых обученных ИТ-специалистов. Быстро развивающиеся регионы, такие как Индия и Латинская Америка, могут испытывать больший дефицит.\n\nСредняя школа в Рединге, Англия, оплачивает инфраструктуру, в которой она нуждается, за счет сочетания частных и государственных денег. Старшая школа ожидает, что сообщество внесет свой вклад. Взрослые могут получить онлайн-техническую подготовку либо в школах чтения, которые открываются для этой цели по вечерам и выходным, либо дома. Плата за эту услугу идет на поддержание и расширение ИТ-системы.\n\nБольшинство работников умственного труда в Соединенных Штатах имеют свой собственный компьютер, но даже в лучших школах на каждый компьютер обычно приходится более семи учеников. Для школ дорого покупать компьютеры для каждого ученика, особенно когда компьютеры устаревают каждые три года или около того. По этой причине существует опасение, что разрыв между \" имущими \"-теми семьями, которые могут позволить себе ПК дома, и\"неимущими\" -теми, кто не может позволить себе ПК дома,-создаст серьезный разрыв в возможностях. Творческие подходы в предоставлении ПК каждому студенту начинают помогать решать эту проблему.\n\nОдин проект был начат в начале 1990-х годов в Мельбурне, Австралия, где Брюс Диксон, учитель, интересующийся технологиями, увидел значительные различия в результатах преподавания, когда он мог использовать полдюжины компьютеров для своих занятий вместо одного. Он понял, что для достижения наилучших результатов учащиеся должны использовать ПК в качестве инструмента для всей своей работы - во всех классах и дома, а также в школе.\n\nИз многих встреч возникла идея, чтобы все студенты финансировали свои собственные машины. Диксон, к тому времени уже консультант по технологиям, разработал финансовый план. За ежемесячную плату студенты получают машину и программное обеспечение. Продавец оказывает услуги, а когда студент заканчивает учебу, машина остается у семьи. Все еще трудно всем семьям позволить себе такие сборы. Более состоятельные семьи могут позволить себе типичную ежемесячную плату в сорок долларов в течение трех лет. Многие семьи могут позволить себе заплатить небольшую сумму. Бизнес и общественные организации могут компенсировать разницу. Какой бы ни была сумма, семейный вклад является основным для этой программы, поскольку он дает студентам и их родителям чувство владения и ответственности за компьютер и за его роль в образовании студентов.\n\nПодобные программы распространились на школы по всему миру. Эффект был впечатляющим. Недавний отчет показывает, что студенты, которые регулярно используют компьютеры, приобретают много навыков. Они пишут чаще и лучше; у них лучше навыки анализа; они выражают себя более творчески; они работают более независимо, и они лучше решают проблемы и критическое мышление.\n\nОдна из самых перспективных идей заключается в том, чтобы использовать ПК, чтобы предложить различные способы обучения. Около пятидесяти различных основных теорий пытаются описать индивидуальные стили обучения. Большинство теорий идентифицируют сходные качества. Проще говоря, некоторые люди учатся лучше, читая, некоторые слушая, некоторые наблюдая, как кто-то другой выполняет задание, некоторые выполняя задание. Большинство из нас учится с помощью сочетания всех этих методов. И все люди имеют разные уровни способностей, разные личности и жизненный опыт, которые влияют на то, насколько хорошо они учатся. Новое программное обеспечение помогает студентам учиться, независимо от их стиля обучения или способностей. Программное обеспечение может представлять информацию во многих различных формах, которые могут быть адаптированы к индивидуальному студенту гораздо легче, чем бумажные методы.\n\nПК могут помочь изменить опыт обучения от традиционного подхода-учитель говорит перед классом, с заданиями на чтение-к более практическому подходу, который использует естественное любопытство студентов всех возрастов. ПК позволяют учащимся изучать информацию с их собственной скоростью, учиться на звуке и изображениях, а также на тексте, проводить эксперименты и работать вместе с другими учащимися.\n\nПК являются основными инструментами для работы и общения в цифровую эпоху. Компьютер и интернет полностью меняют одно: они обеспечивают каждого ученика в каждой школе и сообществе информацией и способами работы, которые до сих пор были недоступны даже ученикам лучших школ. Педагоги воспользуются этим, чтобы помочь своим общинам. ПК-это новый инструмент преподавания и обучения, и преподаватели, которые используют их, будут агентами перемен.\n\nГлава пятая.\n\nОжидайте неожиданного.\n\nГотовьтесь к цифровому будущему.\n\nКлиенты-это основные люди, которые получают выгоду от повышения эффективности информационных технологий, и эти выгоды будут увеличиваться по мере того, как экономика становится все более цифровой. Другие люди, которые выигрывают, - это бизнесмены, которые используют цифровые методы быстрее, чем их конкуренты. Решения, о которых я говорил в этой книге, являются результатом видения и лидерства деловых людей, которые использовали его, чтобы лучше обслуживать своих клиентов.\n\nБизнес-лидеры, добившиеся успеха, воспользуются преимуществами нового способа ведения бизнеса, основанного на растущей скорости распространения информации. Новый способ заключается не в том, чтобы применять технологию ради нее самой, а в том, чтобы использовать ее для изменения поведения компаний. Чтобы в полной мере воспользоваться преимуществами технологий, бизнес-лидеры сделают свои процессы и организации проще и современнее. Цель состоит в том, чтобы сделать реакцию бизнеса почти мгновенной и сделать стратегическое мышление процессом, который происходит постоянно, а не чем - то, что делается каждые двенадцать-восемнадцать месяцев, отдельно от ежедневного потока бизнеса.\n\nНовая технология должна предоставлять лучшую информацию каждому работнику, который может ее использовать. Работники умственного труда-это мозги компании. Если они отключены от важных данных компании, как они могут работать, как они могут взять на себя ответственность? Вы можете давать людям задания и полномочия, но без информации они ничего не смогут сделать. Знание-лучший инструмент власти. Если важная информация о производственных системах, проблемах продукта, кризисах и возможностях клиентов, потерянных продажах и других важных деловых новостях проходит через организацию в течение нескольких минут, а не дней, и если правильные люди могут работать над проблемами в течение нескольких часов, а не дней, бизнес получает огромное преимущество. Это изменение в структуре процессов является более важным, чем любое другое изменение со времен массового производства.\n\nКаждая компания может выбрать, быть ли ей лидером или следовать цифровым тенденциям. Интернет меняет основу отраслей в реальном времени. Победить нелегко. Цифровой информационный поток и предоставление власти сотрудникам - это часть достижения и поддержания конкурентного преимущества. Вера в то, что люди наделены властью, является ключом к получению максимальной отдачи от цифровой нервной системы. Работники умственного труда и бизнес-менеджеры получают больше и лучше информации, а не только высшее руководство. Когда сотрудники получают пару хороших инструментов, которые дают лучшие результаты, они требуют больше. Это позитивный цикл.\n\nКак бы вы ни организовывали свою компанию, ясно одно: полностью управлять компанией из центра невозможно. Невозможно, чтобы один человек или группа людей оставались в курсе всех вопросов в каждой области бизнеса. Лидеры должны обеспечивать планирование и руководство, а также предоставлять сотрудникам инструменты, позволяющие им собирать информацию и понимание со всего мира. Компании, которые пытаются направлять каждое действие из центра, просто не смогут двигаться достаточно быстро, чтобы справиться со скоростью новой экономики.\n\nВ бизнесе спор между центральной властью и индивидуумом заключается в различии между старым стилем мышления, который рассматривал рабочих как ленивых людей, нуждающихся в контроле, и теорией о том, что рабочие являются творческими и должны нести ответственность. Цифровые процессы поддерживают идею о том, что работники могут - и будут - делать больше, если им позволят, позволят и поощрят думать и действовать.\n\nЭтот спор о центре и индивидууме не просто академический. Выбор влияет на дизайн компаний и систем. Конструкция первого пилотируемого космического корабля потрясла первых пилотов много лет назад. Ручного управления полетом не было. Не волнуйтесь, сказали ученые. Система будет управлять кораблем. Пилоты, как и обезьяны до них, были там только для поездки. Пилоты сопротивлялись. Все они имели опыт работы с \"продвинутыми\" системами, которые выходили из строя, когда становилось трудно. Пилоты победили, и в нескольких полетах мастерство пилотов благополучно доставило их домой, когда центральная запрограммированная система отказала. Вопрос не в том, могут ли компьютеры летать лучше пилотов. Сегодня самолеты и космические корабли используют большое количество компьютерных технологий для расширения возможностей человека летать. Вопрос в том, может ли кто - то \"в центре\", вдали от реальных обстоятельств, предсказать все, что может измениться или пойти не так-будь то в космосе или в деловом офисе.\n\nМногие части бизнеса могут быть улучшены с помощью цифровых систем, но потребуется много лет, чтобы улучшить каждую отдельную часть. Каждый бит данных в компании должен быть в цифровой форме, и его легко найти, включая каждый файл, каждую запись, каждый фрагмент электронной почты, каждую веб-страницу. Каждый внутренний процесс должен быть цифровым и связанным с любым другим процессом. Каждая операция с партнерами и клиентами должна быть цифровой. Вы должны позволить партнерам и клиентам иметь все данные, которые им подходят, и они должны сделать то же самое для вас.\n\nЛюди-не самые большие животные, не самые сильные и быстрые, не самые острые на вид и обоняние. Мы выжили и добились успеха благодаря своему мозгу. Мы научились пользоваться инструментами, строить жилища, изобретать сельское хозяйство, держать сельскохозяйственных животных, развивать цивилизацию и культуру, лечить и предотвращать болезни. Наши инструменты и технологии помогли нам сформировать окружающую среду.\n\nЯ позитивный человек. Я верю в прогресс. Я бы предпочел остаться в живых сегодня, чем когда - либо в истории-и не только потому, что в более ранние времена мои навыки не были бы столь ценны, и я был бы хорошим кандидатом на обед животного. Орудия индустриальной эпохи расширили возможности наших мышц. Инструменты цифровой эпохи расширяют возможности нашего разума. Я еще счастливее за своих детей, которые вырастут в этом новом мире.\n\nС энтузиазмом вступая в цифровую эпоху, мы можем ускорить положительные эффекты и лучше справляться с такими проблемами, как конфиденциальность и проблема \"имущих\" и \"неимущих\". Если мы будем сидеть сложа руки и ждать, пока цифровой век придет к нам на условиях, определенных другими, мы не сможем сделать ни того, ни другого. Веб-образ жизни может повысить вовлеченность граждан в управление государством. Многие решения, которые необходимо принять, носят политический и социальный характер, а не технический. Они включают в себя то, как мы делаем так, чтобы каждый мог попасть в Интернет, и как мы защищаем детей. Граждане любой культуры должны присоединиться к дискуссии о влиянии цифровых технологий, чтобы убедиться, что новая цифровая эпоха отражает общество, которое они хотят создать.\n\nЦифровой мир, конечно, делает его жестким и неопределенным для бизнеса, но мы все выиграем. Мы получим улучшенные продукты и услуги, лучшие ответы на жалобы, более низкие затраты и больше возможностей выбора. Мы получим лучшие государственные и социальные услуги, которые будут стоить намного дешевле. Этот мир приближается. Большая часть этого происходит благодаря бизнесу, использующему цифровую нервную систему для улучшения своих процессов. Цифровая нервная система может помочь бизнесу определить себя и свою роль в будущем, но успех или неудача зависят от лидеров бизнеса. Только вы можете подготовить свою организацию и инвестировать таким образом, чтобы воспользоваться преимуществами быстро наступающего цифрового века.\n\nЦифровые инструменты расширяют возможности, которые делают нас уникальными в мире: способность думать, способность выражать свои мысли, способность работать вместе, чтобы действовать в соответствии с этими мыслями. Я твердо верю, что если компании дадут своим сотрудникам возможность решать проблемы и дадут им мощные инструменты для этого, они всегда будут поражены тем, как много творческого и независимого мышления появится.",
