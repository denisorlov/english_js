On my lap lay the large envelope, I had received from my father that morning, still unopened, because when Dad phoned to tell me about it, my mind had been elsewhere. My girlfriend was leaving me.\n\nI opened Dad's envelope. A large-format paperback book slipped out, with a note inside and a used envelope folded in half.\n\nThe note said, \"Dear Andy, Here is the book I told you about. I think it was sent by the same woman who rang me. She asked me if I knew where you were. I'm enclosing the envelope the book arrived in. The postmark is a bit blurred, but maybe you can make it out. Your mother would love to know when you are coming to stay with us again. How about next weekend? With love, Dad\".\n\nAt last, I remembered some of my father's phone call. He told me the book had arrived, and that the woman who had sent it appeared to be a distant relative, because she had been talking about my family.\n\nHere, though, was the book. It was called Secret Methods of Magic, and the author was one Alfred Borden. It was one of instructional books of card tricks, illusions involving silk scarves, and so on. The only aspect of it that interested me at first glance was that although it was a recently published paperback, the text itself looked like a reproduction of a much older edition: the typography, the illustrations, the chapter headings and the writing style all suggested this.\n\nI couldn't see why I should be interested in such a book. Only the author's name was familiar: Borden was the surname I had been born with, although when I was adopted as a small child my name was changed. My name now, my full and legal name, is Andrew Westley, and although I have always known that I was adopted I grew up thinking of Duncan and Jillian Westley as Dad and Mum, loved them as parents, and behaved as their son. All this is still true. I feel nothing for my natural parents. I'm not curious about them, and have no wish to trace them now that I am an adult.\n\nThere is, though, one matter concerning my background that is almost obsessive.\n\nI am almost certain, that I was born one of a pair of identical twins, and that my brother and I were separated at the time of adoption. I have no idea why this was done, nor where my brother might be, but I have always assumed that he was adopted at the same time as me. I only started to suspect his existence when I was thirteen. By chance, I came across a passage in a book, an adventure story, that described the way in which many pairs of twins are linked by an inexplicable, psychic contact. Even living in different countries, such twins will share feelings of pain, surprise, happiness, depression, one twin sending to the other, and vice versa. Reading this was one of those moments in life when suddenly a lot of things become clear.\n\nAll my life, as long as I can remember, I have had the feeling that someone else is sharing my life. As a child, I thought little of it and assumed everyone else had the same feelings. As I grew older, and I realized none of my friends was going through the same thing, it became a mystery. Reading the book therefore came as a great relief as it explained everything. I had a twin somewhere.\n\nThe feeling of link is generally vague. It is a sense of somebody caring for you. More direct \"messages\" come only occasionally. Once or twice when I have been drunk, for example, I have felt my brother's anxiety growing in me, a fear that I might come to some harm. On one of these occasions, when I was leaving a party late at night and was going to drive myself home, the flash of concern that reached me was so powerful that I drove home inexplicably sober that night.\n\nSometimes I have also sensed my brother in pain, or frightened, or threatened in some way, and have been able to \"send\" feelings of calm, or sympathy, or reassurance towards him. It is a psychic mechanism I can use without understanding it. No one has ever explained it, even though it is common and well documented.\n\nThere is in my case, however, an extra mystery.\n\nAs far as records are concerned, I never had a brother of any kind. I have some memories of my life before adoption, although I was only three when that happened, and I can't remember my brother at all. Dad and Mum knew nothing about it.\n\nAs an adoptee, you have certain legal rights. The most important of these is protection from your natural parents: they cannot contact you by any legal means. Another right is that when you reach adulthood you are able to ask about some of the circumstances of your adoption. You can find out the names of your natural parents and the address of the court of law where the adoption was made, and therefore where important records can be examined.\n\nI followed all this up soon after my eighteenth birthday, anxious to find out what I could about my brother. I discovered that I had been put up for adoption by my father, whose name was Clive Alexander Borden. My mother's name was Diana Ruth Borden (nee Ellington), but she had died soon after I was born. I assumed that the adoption happened because of her death, but in fact, I was not adopted for more than two years after she died, during which period my father brought me up by himself. My own original name was Nicholas Julius Borden. There was nothing about any other child.\n\nEven so, my psychic contacts with my twin remained through all this, and have continued ever since.\n\nThe book had been published in the USA. The cover painting depicted a stage magician pointing his hands expressively towards a wooden cabinet, from which a young lady was emerging. She was wearing a dazzling smile and a costume, which for that time looked saucy.\n\nUnder the author's name was printed: \"Edited and annotated by Lord Colderdale\".\n\nAt the bottom of the cover, was the notice: \"The Famous Oath-Protected Book of Secrets\".\n\nA longer and much more descriptive recommendation was on the back cover:\n\nOriginally published as a strictly limited edition in 1905 in London, this book was sold only to professional magicians who swore an oath of secrecy about its contents. First edition copies are now very rare.\n\nMade publicly available for the first time, this new edition is completely unabridged and contains all the original illustrations, as well as the notes provided by Britain's Earl of Colderdale, a famous contemporary amateur of magic.\n\nThe author is Alfred Borden, inventor of the legendary illusion The New Transported Man. Borden, whose stage name was Le Professeur de la Magie, was in the first decade of this century the leading stage illusionist. Encouraged in his early years by John Henry Anderson, and as a protege of Nevil Maskelyne's, Borden was a contemporary of Houdini, David Devant, Chung Ling Soo and Buatier de Kolta. He was based in London, England, but frequently toured the United States and Europe.\n\nThis book with its broad understanding of magical methods will give both laymen and professionals startling insights into the mind of one of the greatest magicians who ever lived.\n\nIt was amusing to discover that one of my ancestors had been a magician, but I had no special interest in the subject. The illusions you sometimes see on television are impressive, but I have never felt curious about how the effects are achieved. Someone once said that the trouble with magic was that the more a magician protects his secrets, the more banal they turn out to be.\n\nAlfred Borden's book contained a long section on card tricks, and another described tricks with cigarettes and coins. Explanatory drawings and instructions accompanied each one. At the back of the book was a chapter about stage illusions, with many illustrations of cabinets with hidden compartments, boxes with false bottoms, tables with lifting devices concealed behind curtains, and other apparatus. I glanced through some of these pages.\n\nThe first half of the book was not illustrated, but consisted of a long account of the author's life and outlook on magic. It began with the following words:\n\nI write in the year 1901.\n\nMy name, my real name, is Alfred Borden. The story of my life is the story of the secrets by which I have lived my life. They are described in this narrative for the first and last time.\n\nI was born in 1856 on the eighth day of the month of May, in the coastal town of Hastings. I was a healthy, vigorous child. My father was a tradesman, a master wheelwright and cooper. Our house -\n\nI wondered what relation Alfred Borden would be to me. If he wasn't a cousin or an uncle, then he would be my great - or great-great-grandfather. If he was born in 1856, he was in his middle forties when he wrote the book; he was therefore not my father's father, but of an earlier generation.\n\nThe Introduction was written in much the same style as the main text. The book was based on Borden's private notebook, not intended for publication. Colderdale had considerably expanded and clarified the narrative, and added the descriptions of most of the tricks. There was no extra biographical information about Borden, but presumably I would find some if I read the whole book.\n\nI couldn't see how the book was going to tell me anything about my brother. He remained my only interest in my natural family.\n\nAt this point, my mobile phone began beeping. It was Sonja, the secretary of my editor, Len Wickham.\n\n\"Andy, there's been a change of plan about the car,\" she said. \"Eric Lambert had to take it in for a repair to the brakes, so it's in a garage\".\n\nShe gave me the address. This car in Sheffield, an old Ford, prevented me from driving up in my own car. Len wouldn't allow the expenses if a company car was available.\n\n\"Did Uncle say anything else\"? I said.\n\n\"Such as\"?\n\n\"This story's still on\"?\n\n\"Yes\".\n\n\"Has anything else come in from the agencies\"?\n\n\"We've had a faxed confirmation from California. Franklin is still a prisoner\".\n\n\"All right\".\n\nWe hung up. Then I spoke to my father. I told him I was on my way to Sheffield, would be driving from there into the Peak District and if it was OK with them (of course it would be) I could come and stay the night. My father sounded pleased. He and Jillian still lived in Wilmslow, Cheshire, and now I was working in London my trips to see them were infrequent.\n\nAfter we had hung up, I put the book in my case and stared through the train window at the passing countryside. I had to concentrate on the incident I was going to investigate. I worked for the Chronicle as a journalist. The true state of affairs was that Dad was himself a newspaperman, and had formerly worked for the Manchester Evening Post, a sister paper to the Chronicle. It was a matter of pride to him that I had obtained the job, even though I have always suspected him of pulling strings for me.\n\nLen Wickham, my supervising editor, had assigned me to any story that involved witches, levitation, spontaneous combustion, crop circles, and other unusual subjects. In most cases, I had already discovered, once you went into these things properly there was generally not much to say about them, and very few of the stories I wrote were ever printed.\n\nThere was an extra twist this time. With some pleasure, Wickham informed me that someone from the sect had phoned to ask if the Chronicle was planning to cover the story, and if so had asked for me in person. They had seen some of my earlier articles, thought I showed the right degree of honest skepticism, and could therefore write a proper article.\n\nA Californian religious sect called the Rapturous Church of Christ Jesus had established a community in a large country house in a Derbyshire village. One of the women members had died of natural causes a few days earlier. Her doctor was present, as was her daughter. As she lay on the point of death, a man had entered the room. He stood beside the bed and made soothing gestures with his hands. The woman died soon after, and the man immediately left the room without speaking to the other two. He was not seen afterwards. He had been recognized by the woman's daughter, and by two members of the sect who had come into the room while he was there, as the man who had founded the sect. This was Father Patrick Franklin, and the sect had grown up around him because of his claimed ability to bilocate.\n\nThe incident was newsworthy for two reasons. It was the first of Franklin's bilocations witnessed by non-members of the sect. And the other reason was that Franklin's location on that day could be firmly established: he was in prison in California, and as Sonja had just confirmed to me on the phone he was still there.\n\nCHAPTER TWO.\n\nThe community was established on the outskirts of the Peak District village of Caldlow, once a centre of slate mining, now dependent on day-trippers. There was a pony trekking club, several gift shops and a hotel.\n\nI stopped in the village for a cup of tea, thinking I might talk to some of the locals about the Rapturous Church, but apart from me, the cafe was empty, and the woman who worked behind the counter said she drove in daily from Chesterfield.\n\nWhile I was sitting there, my brother unexpectedly made contact with me. The sensation was so distinct that I turned my head in surprise, thinking for a moment that someone in the room had addressed me. I closed my eyes, lowered my face, and listened for more.\n\nNo words. Nothing I could answer or write down or even put into words for myself. But I felt anticipation, happiness, excitement, pleasure, encouragement.\n\nI tried to send back: what are you encouraging me to do? Is it something about this religious community?\n\nI was hoping another signal would come from him. I tried to reach out mentally to him, thinking perhaps his contact with me was a way of getting me to communicate with him, but in this sense, I could feel nothing of him there.\n\nI swallowed the rest of my tea, returned the cup and saucer to the counter, smiled politely, then hurried out to the car. As I sat down and slammed the door, a second message came from my brother. It was the same as the first, a direct urging of me to arrive, to be there with him. It was still impossible to put it into words.\n\nThe entrance to the Rapturous Church was barred by a pair of gates and a gatehouse. I parked my car and walked across to the gatehouse. Inside the wooden porch, a modern bell push had been attached to the wall, and beneath this was a laser-printed notice:\n\nRAPTUROUS CHURCH OF CHRIST JESUS \n\nWELCOMES YOU, \n\nNO VISITORS WITHOUT APPOINTMENT, \n\nFOR APPOINTMENTS RING CALDLOW 393960, \n\nTRADESMEN AND OTHERS PRESS BELL TWICE, \n\nJESUS LOVES YOU.\n\nI pressed the bell twice, without audible effect.\n\nI went back to the car and rested my backside against the wing while I waited. Soon the gates opened silently from some remote command, so I climbed back into the car and took it up the gravelled drive. The main house came into view: it was a huge and unattractive building of four or five main storeys, with black roofs and walls of dark-brown brick and stone. The windows were tall and narrow. The place gave me a cold feeling, yet even as I drove I felt my brother's presence in me once again, urging me on.\n\nI saw a Visitors this Way sign, and followed it along a gravel path against the main wall of the house. I pushed open a door and went into a narrow hallway. This building was in silence.\n\nI saw a door marked Reception, and knocked. When there was no answer I put my head around the door, but the room was empty. Hearing footsteps I returned to the hallway, and a few moments later a thin middle-aged woman appeared at the turn of the stairs. She was carrying several envelope wallet files. She looked enquiringly at me when she saw me there.\n\n\"I'm looking for Mrs Holloway,\" I said. \"Are you she\"?\n\n\"Yes, I am. How may I help you\"?\n\n\"My name is Andrew Westley, and I'm from the Chronicle\". I showed her my press card, but she merely glanced at it. \"I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about Father Franklin\".\n\n\"Father Franklin is in California at present\".\n\n\"So I believe, but there was the incident last week,\"\n\n\"Which one do you mean\"? said Mrs Holloway.\n\n\"I understand Father Franklin was seen here\".\n\nShe shook her head slowly. \"I think you are making a mistake, Mr Westley\".\n\n\"Did you see Father Franklin when he was here\"? I said. \"I did not. Nor was he here. Have you been in touch with our Press Office\"?\n\n\"Are they here\"?\n\n\"We have an office in London. All press interviews are arranged through them\".\n\n\"I was told to come here\".\n\n\"By our Press Officer\"?\n\n\"No... I understood a request was sent to the Chronicle, after Father Franklin made an appearance. Are you denying that that happened\"?\n\n\"Do you mean the sending of the request? No one here has been in contact with your newspaper. If you mean am I denying the appearance of Father Franklin, the answer is yes\".\n\nWe stared at each other. I was torn between irritation with her and frustration at myself. Whenever incidents like this did not go smoothly, I blamed my lack of experience and motivation. The other writers on the paper always knew how to handle people like Mrs Holloway.\n\n\"Can I see whoever is in charge here\"? I said.\n\n\"I am the head of administration. Everyone else is involved with the teaching\".\n\nI was about to give up, but I said, \"Does my name mean anything at all to you\"?\n\n\"Should it\"?\n\n\"Someone requested me by name\".\n\n\"That came not from here\".\n\n\"Hold on,\" I said.\n\nI walked back to the car to collect the notes I had been given by Wickham the day before. Mrs Holloway was still standing by the bottom of the stairs when I returned, but she had put down her bundle of files somewhere.\n\nI stood beside her while I turned to the page Wickham had been sent. It was a fax message. It said, \"To Mr L. Wickham, Features Editor, Chronicle. The necessary written details you requested are as follows: Rapturous Church of Christ Jesus, Caldlow, Derbyshire. Half a mile outside Caldlow village, to the north, on A623. Mrs Holloway, administrator, will provide your reporter Mr Andrew Westley with information. K Angier.\"\n\n\"This is nothing to do with us,\" Mrs Holloway said. \"I'm sorry\".\n\n\"Who is K Angier\"? I said. \"Mr? Mrs\"?\n\n\"She is the resident of the private wing on the east side of this building, and has no connection with the Church. Thank you\".\n\nShe had placed her hand on my elbow and was propelling me politely towards the door. She indicated that the continuation of the gravel path would take me to a gate, where the entrance to the private wing would be found.\n\nI said, \"I'm sorry if there's been a misunderstanding. I don't know how it happened\".\n\n\"If you want any more information about the Church, I'd be grateful if you'd speak to the Press Office. That is its function, you know\".\n\n\"Yes, all right\".\n\nShe retreated into the building, and closed the door behind her.\n\nI decided to refer back to the office. I rang Len Wickham's direct line and told him what had happened.\n\n\"Have you seen the informant yet\"? he said. \"Someone called Angier\".\n\n\"I'm right outside their place now,\" I said. \"I don't think it's a story. I'm thinking it might just be a dispute between neighbours. You know, complaining about something or other\".\n\nThere was a long silence.\n\nThen Len Wickham said, \"See the neighbour, and if there's anything in it, call me back. If not, get back to London for this evening\".\n\n\"It's Friday,\" I said. \"I thought I'd visit my parents tonight\".\n\nWickham replied by putting down his receiver.\n\nCHAPTER THREE.\n\nI was greeted at the main door of the wing by a woman who looked intently at my press card, then showed me into a side room and asked me to wait. The room was simply but attractively furnished with Indian carpets, antique chairs and a polished table. After about five minutes, the woman returned.\n\n\"Lady Katherine will see you now,\" she said.\n\nShe led me upstairs to a large, pleasant living room that looked out across the valley floor towards high rocks.\n\nA young woman was standing by the open fireplace, and she held out her hand to greet me as I went across to her. I had been embarrassed by the unexpected news that I was visiting a member of the aristocracy, but her manner was cordial. She was tall, dark-haired and had a broad face with a strong jaw.\n\nShe had a nervous intentness about her face, as if she were worried about what I might say or think.\n\nShe greeted me formally, but the moment the other woman had left the room her manner changed. She introduced herself as Kate, not Katherine, Angier, and told me to disregard the title as she rarely used it herself. She asked me to confirm if I was Andrew Westley. I said that I was.\n\n\"I assume you've just been to the main part of the house\"?\n\n\"The Rapturous Church? I hardly got past the door\".\n\n\"I think that was my fault. I warned them you might come, but Mrs Holloway wasn't too pleased\".\n\n\"I suppose it was you who sent the message to my paper\"?\n\n\"I wanted to meet you\".\n\n\"But why\"?\n\n\"I plan to tell you. But I haven't had lunch yet. What about you\"?\n\nI told her I had not eaten since breakfast. I followed her downstairs to the ground floor where the woman who had opened the door to me, addressed by Lady Katherine as Mrs Makin, was preparing a simple lunch of cold meats and cheeses, with salad.\n\nWhile we ate, a polite conversation went on, in which she asked me questions about the newspaper, my career, where I lived and so on. When I finally felt it was time to ask her about herself, she told me that the house we were in had been in her family for more than three hundred years. Her father was an earl, but he lived abroad. Her mother was dead and her only other close relative, an elder sister, was married and lived in Bristol with her husband and children.\n\nThe house had been a family home, with several servants, until the outbreak of the Second World War. The Ministry of Defence had then requisitioned most of the building. At this point, her family had moved into the east wing. After the war, the house was taken over by Derbyshire County Council as offices, and the present tenants (her phrase) arrived in 1980. She said her parents had been worried at first by the prospect of an American religious sect moving in, but by this time the family needed the money and it had worked out well. The Church kept its teaching quiet, and the members were polite and charming to meet.\n\nAs by this point in the conversation, we had finished our meal, and Mrs Makin had brought us some coffee, I said, \"So I take it the story that brought me up here, about a bilocating priest, was false\"?\n\n\"Yes and no. The cult makes no secret of the fact it bases its teaching on the words of its leader. Father Franklin is supposed to be able to bilocate, but he's never been seen doing it by independent witnesses, or at least not under controlled circumstances\".\n\n\"But was it true\"?\n\n\"I'm really not sure. There was a local doctor involved this time, and for some reason she said something to a tabloid newspaper. I only heard about it when I was in the village the other day. I don't think it was true: their leader's in prison in America isn't he\"?\n\n\"But why didn't you just write a letter to me\"? I said.\n\n\"I wasn't sure you were who I thought you were. I wanted to meet you first\".\n\n\"I don't see why you thought a bilocating religious fanatic had anything to do with me\".\n\n\"It was just a coincidence. You know the dispute about the illusion, and all that\". Again, she looked at me expectantly.\n\n\"Who did you think I was\"?\n\n\"The son of Clive Borden. Isn't that right\"?\n\n\"A man called Clive Borden was my natural father,\" I said. \"But I was adopted when I was three\".\n\n\"Well then. I was right about you. We met once before, many years ago, when we were both children. Your name was Nicky then\".\n\n\"I don't remember,\" I said. \"Where did this meeting take place\"?\n\n\"Here, in this house. You really don't remember it\"?\n\n\"Not at all\".\n\n\"Do you have any other memories from when you were that age\"? she said.\n\n\"Only fragments. But none about this place. It's the sort of house that would make an impression on a child, isn't it\"?\n\n\"All right. You're not the first to say that. My sister... she hates this house, and couldn't wait to move away\". She reached behind her, where a small bell rested on a counter, and dinged it twice. \"I usually take a drink after lunch. Would you like to join me\"?\n\n\"Yes, thank you\".\n\nMrs Makin soon appeared, and Lady Katherine stood up.\n\n\"Mr Westley and I will be in the drawing room this afternoon, Mrs Makin\".\n\nAs we went up the broad staircase, I felt an impulse to escape from her, to get away from this house. She knew more about me than I knew myself, but it was knowledge of a part of my life in which I had no interest. This was obviously a day when I had to become a Borden again, whether or not I wished to do so. First, there was the book by him, now this. It was all connected, but I felt her intrigues were not mine. Why should I care about the man, the family, who had turned their back on me?\n\nShe led me into the room where I had first met her, and closed the door behind us. A silver tray with a number of bottles, glasses and a bucket of ice had been placed on a low table set between a number of chairs and a long settee. One of the glasses already held a large drink, presumably prepared by Mrs Makin. Kate indicated I should take a seat, then said, \"What would you like\"?\n\nI said, \"I'll have whatever you're drinking\".\n\n\"It's American whiskey with soda. Do you want that too\"?\n\nI said I did, and watched as she mixed it. When she sat down on the settee, she tucked her legs under her, then drank about half the glass of whiskey straight down.\n\n\"How long can you stay\"? she said.\n\n\"Maybe just this drink\".\n\n\"There's a lot I want to talk to you about. And a lot I want to ask you\".\n\n\"Why\"?\n\n\"Because of what happened when we were children\".\n\n\"I don't think I'm going to be much help to you,\" I said. Now that she wasn't twitching around so much, I was beginning to see her more objectively as a not unattractive woman of roughly my own age. She obviously liked drinking, and was used to the effect of it. That alone made me feel I was on familiar territory; I spent most weekends drinking with my friends.\n\n\"A one-word answer to a question might save a lot of time,\" she said.\n\n\"All right\".\n\n\"Do you have an identical twin brother? Or did you have one who died when you were very young\"?\n\nIt was unexpected.\n\n\"Why do you ask that\"? I said.\n\n\"Do you? Did you\"?\n\n\"I don't know. I think I did, but I've never been able to find him. I mean... I'm not sure\".\n\n\"I think you've given me the answer I was expecting,\" she said. \"But not the one I was hoping for\".\n\nI said, \"If this is something to do with the Borden family, I tell you that I know nothing about them. Do you realize that\"?\n\n\"Yes, but you are a Borden\".\n\n\"I was, but it doesn't mean anything to me\". I suddenly had a glimpse of this young woman's family, stretching back more than three hundred years in an unbroken sequence of generations: same name, same house, same everything. My own family roots went back to the age of three. \"I don't think you can appreciate what adoption means. I was just a little boy, and my father dumped me out of his life. If I spent the rest of my own life grieving about that, I'd have time for nothing else. Long ago, I sealed it off because I had to. I've a new family now\".\n\n\"Your brother is still a Borden, though\".\n\nWhenever she mentioned my brother, I felt a pang of guilt, concern and curiosity. It was as if she used him as a way of getting under my defenses. All my life the existence of my brother had been a part of myself that I kept completely private. Yet here was this stranger speaking of him as if she knew him.\n\n\"Why are you interested in this\"? I said.\n\n\"When you first heard of me, saw my name, did it mean anything to you\"?\n\n\"No\".\n\n\"Have you ever heard of Rupert Angier\"?\n\n\"No\".\n\n\"Or The Great Danton, the illusionist\"?\n\n\"No. My only interest in my former family is that through them I might one day be able to trace my twin brother\".\n\nShe leant forward to mix another drink, and tried to pour more into my glass. Knowing I was going to have to drive later, I pulled my glass back before she could completely fill it.\n\nShe said, \"I think the fate of your brother is connected with something that happened about a hundred years ago. One of my ancestors, Rupert Angier. You say you've never heard of him, and there's no reason why you should, but he was a stage magician at the end of the last century. He worked as The Great Danton, because in those days all the magicians used grandiose stage names. He was the victim of a series of vicious attacks by a man called Alfred Borden, your great-grandfather, who was also an illusionist. You say you know nothing about this\"?\n\n\"Only the book. I assume you sent it\".\n\nShe nodded. \"They had this feud going, and it went on for years. They were constantly attacking each other, usually by interfering with the other one's stage show. The story of the feud is in Borden's book. At least, his side of it is. Have you read it yet\"?\n\n\"It only arrived in the post this morning. I haven't had much of a chance \"\n\n\"I thought you would be fascinated to know what had happened\".\n\nI was thinking, again: why go on about the Bordens? They are too far back, I know too little about them. She was talking about something that was of interest to her, not to me. Deep inside me lay the unconscious defence mechanism a kid builds up for himself when he has been rejected. To adapt to my new family I had had to throw off everything I knew of the old. How many times would I have to say that to her to convince her of it?\n\nSaying she wanted to show me something, she put down her glass and crossed the room to a desk placed against the wall just behind where I was sitting. As she bent to reach into a lower drawer her dress dropped forward at the neck, and I stole a glimpse: a thin white strap, part of a lacy bra cup. She was trying to involve me in something I knew nothing about, but instead I was thinking idly about what it might be like to have sex with her.\n\n\"I haven't had these out for ages,\" Kate said. She had removed some photo albums, and these were piled on the floor while she reached to the back of the deep drawer. \"Here we are\".\n\nShe was clutching an untidy pile of papers, apparently old and faded, all in different sizes. She spread them on the settee beside her, and picked up her glass before she began to leaf through them.\n\n\"My great-grandfather was one of those men who is obsessively neat,\" she said. \"He not only kept everything, he put labels on them, compiled lists, had cupboards specifically in which to keep certain things. When I was growing up my parents had a saying: \"Grandpa's stuff\". We never touched it. But when my sister left to get married, and I was alone here, I finally went through it all and sorted it out. I managed to sell some of the apparatus and costumes, and got good prices too. I found these playbills in the room that had been his study\".\n\nShe passed me a sheet of fragile, yellow-coloured paper. The bill was for the Empress Theatre in Evering Road, Stoke Newington. Over a list of performers, it announced a limited number of performances, afternoons and evenings. Top of the bill, and printed in red ink, was an Irish tenor. There were some other singers. Halfway down the bill, pointed out by Kate's forefinger as she leaned over towards me, was The Great Danton (\"The Greatest Illusionist in the World\").\n\n\"This was before he actually was,\" she said. \"He spent most of his life being hard up, and only really became famous a few years before he died. This bill comes from 1881, when he was first starting to do quite well\".\n\n\"What do all these mean\"? I said, indicating a column of numbers inscribed in the margin of the playbill. More had been written on the back.\n\n\"That's The Great Danton's Obsessive Filing System,\" she said. She moved away from the settee, and knelt informally on the carpet beside my chair. \"I haven't worked it all out, but the first number refers to the job. There's a register somewhere, with a complete list of every show he did. Underneath that, he puts down how many actual performances he carried out, and how many of those were matinees and how many in the evenings. The next numbers are a list of the actual tricks he did, and again he had about a dozen notebooks in his study with descriptions of all the tricks he could do. I have a few of the notebooks still here, and you could probably look up some of the tricks he did in Stoke Newington. But it's even more complicated than that, because most of the tricks have minor variations, and he's got all those cross-referenced as well. Look, this number here, \"10g\". I think that's what he was paid: ten guineas\".\n\n\"Was that good\"?\n\n\"If it was for one night it was brilliant. But it was probably for the whole week, so it was just average. I don't think this was a big theatre\".\n\nI picked up the stack of all the other playbills and as she had said, each one was annotated with similar code numbers.\n\n\"All his apparatus was labelled as well,\" she said. \"When I was clearing out the cellar, every single piece of equipment I came across had an identifying number, and each one had a place in a huge index, all cross-referenced to the other books\".\n\n\"When did he die\"? I said.\n\n\"There's actually some doubt about that, strangely enough. The newspapers say he died in 1903, and there was an obituary in The Times, but there are people in the village who say he was still living here the following year. What I find odd is that I came across the obituary in the scrapbook he kept, and it was stuck down and labelled and indexed, just like all the other stuff\".\n\n\"Can you explain how that happened\"?\n\n\"No. Alfred Borden talks about it in his book. That's where I heard about it, and after that I tried to find out what had happened between them\".\n\n\"Have you got any more of his stuff\"?\n\nWhile she reached over for the scrapbooks, I poured myself another slug of the American whiskey. It was strange to be there, not fully comprehending what was going on, talk of magicians, meetings in childhood, not at work, not driving over to see my parents as I had planned.\n\nIn that part of my mind occupied by my brother, I felt a sense of satisfaction. He was urging me to stay. Outside the window, the cold afternoon sky was darkening. Kate threw another log on the fire.\n\nPART TWO.\n\nALFRED BORDEN.\n\nCHAPTER ONE.\n\nI write in the year 1901.\n\nMy name, my real name, is Alfred Borden. The story of my life is the story of the secrets by which I have lived my life. They are described in this narrative for the first and last time.\n\nI was born in 1856 on the eighth day of the month of May, in the coastal town of Hastings. I was a healthy, vigorous child. My father was a tradesman, a master wheelwright and cooper.\n\nOur house at number 105 Manor Road was larger and taller than others in the road, because it was built over the gateway that led to the yard and sheds behind. My room was on the street side of the house, directly above the gateway, and it was noisy through every day of the year, and very cold in the winter months. It was in that room that I slowly grew up and became the man that I am.\n\nThat man is Le Professeur de la Magie, and I am a master of illusions.\n\nIt is time to pause, for this story is not about my life in the usual habit of autobiographers, but is, as I have said, about my life's secrets. Secrecy is essential to my work.\n\nLet me then first consider and describe the method of writing this account. The very act of describing my secrets might be interpreted as a betrayal of myself, except of course that as I am an illusionist I can make sure you only see what I wish you to see.\n\nIt is therefore only fair that I should from the beginning try to clarify those closely connected subjects - Secrecy and the Appreciation of Secrecy.\n\nHere is an example.\n\nThere always comes a moment during the exercise of my profession when the prestidigitator will seem to pause. He will step forward to the footlights, and will face the audience directly. He will say, or if his act is silent he will seem to say, \"Look at my hands. There is nothing concealed within them\". He will then hold up his hands for the audience to see. With his hands held thus he will rotate them, so that the backs are shown to the audience, and it is established that his hands are, indeed, empty. The magician will probably then pull the cuffs of his jacket back, an inch or two, to expose his wrists, showing that nothing is there concealed either. He then performs his trick, and during it, he produces something from his hands: a fan, a live dove or rabbit, a bunch of paper flowers. It is a paradox, an impossibility! The audience marvels at the mystery, and applause rings out.\n\nHow could any of this be?\n\nThe prestidigitator and the audience have entered into what I term the Pact of Acquiescent Sorcery. They do not express it in words, and indeed the audience is barely aware that such a Pact might exist, but that is what it is.\n\nThe performer is of course not a sorcerer at all, but an actor who plays the part of a sorcerer and who wishes the audience to believe, if only temporarily, that he is in contact with darker powers. The audience, meantime, knows that what they see is not true sorcery, but they suppress the knowledge.\n\nThe act of showing the hands to be empty, before revealing that despite appearances they were not, is itself a part of the Pact. The Pact implies special conditions are in force. In normal social communication, for instance, how often does it happen that someone has to prove that his hands are empty?\n\nThis then illustrates my method.\n\nLet me display the Pact of Acquiescence under which I write these words, so that those who read them will realize that what follows is not sorcery, but the appearance of it.\n\nFirst let me in a manner of speaking show you my hands, with palms forward, and I will say to you (and mark this well): \"Every word in this notebook that describes my life and work is true, honestly meant and accurate in detail\".\n\nNow I rotate my hands so that you may see their backs, and I say to you: \"Much of what is here may be checked. My career is noted in newspaper files, my name appears in books of biographical reference\".\n\nFinally, I pull back the cuffs of my jacket to reveal my wrists, and I say to you: \"After all, what would I have to gain by writing a false account, when it is intended for no one's eyes but my own, perhaps those of my family, and future generations I shall never meet\"?\n\nWhat gain indeed?\n\nBut because I have shown my hands to be empty you must now expect not only that an illusion will follow, but that you will acquiesce in it!\n\nAlready, without once writing a falsehood, I have started the deception that is my life. The lie is contained in these words, even in the very first of them. It is the fabric of everything that follows, yet nowhere will it be apparent.\n\nI have misdirected you with the talk of truth, objective records and motives. Just as it is when I show my hands to be empty I have omitted the significant information, and now you are looking in the wrong place.\n\nAs every stage magician well knows there will be some who are puzzled by this, some who will admit that they are fooled, some who will claim to know the secret, and some, the happy majority, who will simply take the illusion for granted and enjoy the magic for the sake of entertainment.\n\nBut there are always one or two who will take the secret away with them and worry at it without ever coming near to solving it.\n\nBefore I resume the story of my life, here is another anecdote that illustrates my method.\n\nWhen I was younger, there was a famous performer from Shanghai, who worked under the stage name Ching Ling Foo.\n\nI saw Ching perform only once, a few years ago at the Adelphi Theatre in Leicester Square. At the end of the show, I went to the stage door and sent up my card, and he invited me to his dressing room. He did not speak of his magic, but my eye was taken by the large glass bowl of goldfish, which, when apparently produced from thin air, gave his show its fantastic climax. He invited me to examine the bowl, and it was normal in every way. It contained a dozen bright fish, and was filled with water. I tried lifting it, and marvelled at its weight.\n\nChing saw me struggling with it but said nothing. He was obviously unsure whether I knew his secret or not, and was unwilling to say anything that might expose it, even to a fellow professional. I did not know how to reveal that I knew the secret, and so I too kept my silence. I stayed with him for fifteen minutes, during which time he remained seated, nodding politely at the compliments I paid him. When I stood up to leave he rose from his chair by the mirror and conducted me to the door. He walked with his head bowed, his arms slack at his sides, and shuffling as if his legs gave him great pain.\n\nNow, because years have passed and he is dead, I can reveal his guarded secret.\n\nHis famous goldfish bowl was with him on stage throughout his act, ready for its sudden and mysterious appearance. Its presence was skilfully concealed from the audience. He carried it beneath the flowing mandarin gown, clutching it between his knees, kept ready for the sensational and apparently miraculous presentation at the end. No one in the audience could ever guess at how the trick was done.\n\nThe only possible place where the heavy bowl could be concealed was beneath his gown, yet that was logically impossible. It was obvious to everyone that Ching Ling Foo was physically weak; he was shuffling painfully. When he took his bow at the end, he leaned for support on his assistant.\n\nThe reality was completely different. Ching was a fit man of great physical strength, and carrying the bowl in this way was well within his power. But the size and shape of the bowl caused him to shuffle like a mandarin as he walked. This threatened the secret, because it drew attention to the way he moved, so to protect the secret he shuffled for the whole of his life. He never, at home or in the street, walked with a normal gait in order not to expose his secret.\n\nSuch is the nature of a man who acts the role of sorcerer.\n\nAudiences know well that a magician will practise his illusions for years, but few people realize the extent of the prestidigitator's wish to deceive, the way in which the apparent confrontation with normal laws becomes an obsession, which rules every moment of his life.\n\nChing Ling Foo had his obsessive deception, and now that you have read my anecdote about him, you may correctly assume that I have mine. My deception rules my life, informs every decision I make, regulates my every movement. Even now, it controls what I may write and what I may not. I have compared my method with the display of seemingly bared hands, but in reality, everything in this account represents the shuffling walk of a fit man.\n\nCHAPTER TWO.\n\nMy parents sent me to school, where I learnt the three Rs, as well as a little History, Geography and the fearsome French language. My fruitless struggles to learn French have an ironic outcome, because in adult life my stage persona is that of a French professor.\n\nI could say much about my father, good and bad, but for the sake of concentrating on my own story, I shall say the best. I loved him, and learnt from him many of the cabinet-making techniques, which have helped me to make my name and fortune. My father was hardworking, honest, sober, intelligent and, in his own way, generous. He was fair to his employees. He was not a God-fearing man, and no churchgoer, but he brought up his family to act so that neither their action nor inaction should cause hurt or harm to others. He was a brilliant cabinet-maker and a good wheelwright.\n\nMy mother's name was Betsy May Borden (nee Robertson), my father's name was Joseph Andrew Borden. I had seven brothers and sisters, although because of infant deaths I knew only five of them. I was neither the oldest nor the youngest child, and was not particularly favoured by either parent. I grew up in reasonable harmony with most, if not all, of my siblings.\n\nWhen I was twelve, I was taken away from the school and placed to work as a wheelwright's apprentice in my father's yard. Here my adult life began. My own real future started to become clear to me. Two factors were essential.\n\nThe first was the handling of wood. I had grown up with the sight and smell of it, so that both were familiar to me. I began to respect wood, and realize what could be done with it. Wood is beautiful, strong, light and supple. It can be cut to almost any shape. You can paint it, bleach it, flex it. It is at once outstanding and commonplace, so that when something manufactured of wood is present it gives a quiet feeling of solid normality, and so is hardly ever noticed.\n\nIn short, it is the ideal medium for the illusionist.\n\nOn my first day at the yard, I was sent to begin learning the business by taking on the roughest, hardest job in the yard - I and another apprentice worked in a sawpit. The twelve-hour days of that (we started at 6 am and finished at 8 pm every day, with only three short breaks for meals) hardened my body, and taught me to fear as well as respect timber. After that initiation, which continued for several months, I was moved to the less physically demanding but more exacting work of learning to cut, turn and smooth the wood for the spokes of the wheels. Here I came into regular contact with the wheelwrights and other men who worked for my father, and saw less of my fellow apprentices.\n\nOne morning, about a year after I had left school, a contract worker named Robert Noonan came to the yard to carry out some long-needed repair and redecoration work to the rear wall of the yard, which had been damaged in a storm some years before. With Noonan's arrival came the second great influence on the direction of my future life.\n\nI, busy with my work, barely even noticed him, but at 1 pm when we broke for lunch, Noonan came and sat with me and the other men at the table. He produced a pack of playing cards, and asked if any of us would care to \"find the lady\". Some of the older men teased him, but a few of us stayed to watch. Tiny sums of money began to change hands; not mine, for I had none to spare, but one or two of the workmen were willing to gamble a few pence.\n\nWhat fascinated me was the smooth, natural way that Noonan manipulated the cards. He was so fast! He spoke softly and persuasively, showing us the faces of the three playing cards, placing them down on the small box in front of him with a quick but flowing motion, then moving them about with his long fingers before pausing to challenge us to indicate which of the cards was the Queen. The workmen had slower eyes than mine; they spotted the card rather less often than I did (although I was wrong more often than I was right).\n\nAfterwards, I said to Noonan, \"How do you do that? Will you show me\"?\n\nI persisted. \"I want to know how you do it\"! I cried. \"The Queen is placed in the middle of the three, but you move the cards only twice and she is not where I think she is! What's the secret\"?\n\nSo one lunchtime, he took me to a quiet corner of the shed and showed me how to manipulate the three cards so that the hand deceived the eye. The Queen and another card were gripped lightly between the thumb and middle finger of the left hand, one above the other; the third card was held in the right hand. When the cards were placed, he moved his hands crosswise, brushing his fingertips on the surface and pausing briefly, so suggesting the Queen was put down first. In fact, it was almost invariably one of the other cards that slipped quietly down before her. This is the classic trick whose correct name is Three-Card Monte.\n\nWhen I had grasped the idea of that, Noonan showed me several other techniques. He went through all this in a casual way, boasting rather than showing. When he had finished his demonstration I tried the technique with the Queen, but the cards scattered all about. I tried again. Then again. And on and on, long after Noonan himself had lost interest and walked away. By the evening of the first day, alone in my bedroom, I had mastered Three-Card Monte, and was starting to work on the other techniques I had briefly seen.\n\nOne day, when his painting work was completed, Noonan left the yard and I never saw him again. I intended to master the art that I now knew (from a book I urgently borrowed from the library) was called Legerdemain.\n\nLegerdemain, sleight of hand, prestidigitation, became the dominant interest of my life.\n\nCHAPTER THREE.\n\nThe next three years saw parallel developments in my life. For one thing, I was an adolescent growing rapidly into a man. For another, my father quickly realized that I had an appreciable skill as a woodworker, and that the wheelwright's work was not best for me, so when he was able to, he instructed me in the finer craft of cabinet making. Finally, I was learning how to make magic with my hands.\n\nEvery possible moment of my spare time was devoted to practising the prestidigitator's art. In particular, I learnt and tried to master all the known tricks of playing-card manipulation. I saw sleight of hand as the foundation of all magic. It was difficult obtaining reference works on the subject, but books on magic exist and the diligent researcher can find them. Night after night, in my room, I stood before a full-length mirror and practised palming and forcing, shuffling cards and spreading them, passing and fanning them. I learnt the art of misdirection, in which the magician bases on the audience's everyday experience to confuse their senses - the metal birdcage that looks too rigid to collapse, the ball that seems too large to be concealed in a sleeve. I quickly combined a repertoire of such legerdemain skills, practising each one of them until I had it right, until I was perfect at it. I never ceased practising.\n\nThe strength and dexterity of my hands was the key to this.\n\nEvery day, even now in my maturity, I exercise my hands. They are strong enough to burst a sealed rubber tennis ball. I can bend steel nails between my fingers, and if I slam the heel of my hand against hardwood, the hardwood splinters. Yet the same hand can lightly suspend a coin by its edge between my third and fourth fingertips, while the rest of the hand writes on a blackboard, or holds the arm of a volunteer from the audience, and it can hold the coin there through all this before sliding it dexterously to where it might seem magically to appear.\n\nMy left hand bears a small scar, a reminder of the time in my youth when I learnt the true value of my hands. I already knew that the human hand was a delicate instrument, fine, strong and sensitive. But carpentry was hard on my hands, an unpleasant fact I discovered one morning in the yard. A moment's lost attention, a careless movement with a chisel, and I cut a deep slash in my left hand. The older men were used to dealing with such injuries, and knew what to do; a band was rapidly applied, and I was taken to hospital. For two weeks afterwards, my hand was bandaged. After a discouraging period when the hand was stiff and awkward to use, within two months I was back to normal.\n\nI took it as a warning, though. My legerdemain was then only a hobby. But it was a passion, even, yes, the beginning of an obsession. I could not allow an injury to put it in danger!\n\nThat cut was therefore another turning point. Before it happened I was a trainee wheelwright with an interesting pastime, but afterwards I was a young magician who would allow nothing to stand in his way.\n\nI have read it through several times.\n\nMuch is missing! I think I must write about the meeting with John Henry Anderson next, because he introduced me to the Maskelynes.\n\nI assume there is no particular reason why I can't go straight to this?\n\nEither I must do this now, or leave a note for me to find. Exchange me more often!\n\nI must not leave out on any account:\n\n1: The way I discovered what Angier was doing, and what I did about him.\n\n2: Olive Wenscombe (not my fault).\n\n3: What about Sarah? The children?\n\nThe Pact extends even to this, does it? That's how I interpret it. If so, either I have to leave a lot out, or I have to put in a great deal more.\n\nI am surprised to discover how much I have already written.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR.\n\nWhen I was sixteen, in 1872, John Henry Anderson brought his Touring Magical Show to Hastings. I attended his show every night, taking seats as close to the front of the auditorium as I could afford. At that time, he was the leading stage illusionist with a touring show and he was credited with the invention of numerous new effects. He also had a reputation for helping and encouraging young magicians.\n\nEvery night Mr Anderson performed one particular trick known in the world of magic as the Modern Cabinet Illusion. During this, he invited on stage a small group of volunteers from the audience. These men (they were always men) assisted in pulling on to the stage a tall wooden cabinet on wheels, sufficiently raised from the floor to show that no one could enter it through a trap in the base. Then the men were invited to inspect the cabinet inside and out to satisfy themselves it was empty, turn it around for the audience to see it from all sides, even choose one of their number to step inside for a moment to prove that no other person could be concealed within it. Then they helped to lock the door and secure it with heavy padlocks. While the group remained on the stage Mr Anderson once again rotated the cabinet for the audience, then with quick motions he dashed away the padlocks, threw open the door and out stepped a beautiful young assistant, wearing a voluminous dress and large hat.\n\nEvery night when Mr Anderson made his call for volunteers, I stood up eagerly to be selected, and every night he passed me by. I badly wanted to be chosen! I wanted to find out what it was like to be on the stage under the lights, in front of an audience. I wanted to be near to Mr Anderson when he was performing the illusion. And I positively craved a good close look at the way the cabinet had been built. Of course, I knew the secret of the Modern Cabinet, because by this time, I had learnt or worked out for myself the mechanism of every illusion then current. The secret of that particular illusion is all in the making of the cabinet.\n\nAfter the last show of his short season, I plucked up my courage and went to the stage door, intending to approach Mr Anderson when he left the theatre. Instead, I had been standing outside for no more than a minute when the doorman walked out to speak to me.\n\n\"Pardon me, sir,\" he said. \"But Mr Anderson has left instructions that if you appear at this entrance I should invite you to join him in his dressing room\".\n\nNeedless to say, I was astounded!\n\n\"Are you sure he meant me\"? I said.\n\n\"Yes, sir. I'm positive\".\n\nStill mystified, but extremely pleased and excited, I followed the doorman's directions, and soon found the star's dressing room. Inside -\n\nInside, there followed a short, thrilling interview with Mr Anderson.\n\nTwo topics came up that are of some interest.\n\nThe first was his explanation of why he had never chosen me from the audience. He said he had almost picked me out at the opening performance because I had been the first to leap to my feet, but something had made him change his mind. Then he said that when he saw me at subsequent performances he realized that I must be a fellow magician (how my heart leapt with joy at such recognition!), and was therefore reluctant to invite me to take part. He did not know if I might have secret motives. Many magicians, particularly rising young ones, are not above trying to steal ideas from their more established colleagues, and therefore I understood Mr Anderson's caution. Even so, he apologized for distrusting me.\n\nThe second matter followed on from this: he had realized I must be starting out in my career. With this in mind, he gave me a short letter of introduction, to be presented at St George's Hall in London, where I would be able to meet Mr Nevil Maskelyne himself.\n\nSome six months after the exciting meeting with Mr Anderson I indeed approached Mr Maskelyne in London, and it was after this that my professional career as a magician properly began. That, in its barest outline, is the story of how I met Mr Anderson and, through him, Mr Maskelyne.\n\nI shall now return to address the main thrust of this narrative, which is what I intended to do before I interrupted.\n\nCHAPTER FIVE.\n\nSome years ago, a magician (I believe it was Mr David Devant) said: \"Magicians protect their secrets not because the secrets are large and important, but because they are so small and trivial. The wonderful effects created on stage are often the result of a secret so absurd that the magician would be embarrassed to admit that that was how it was done\".\n\nThere, in a nutshell, is the paradox of the stage magician.\n\nThe fact that a trick is \"spoiled\" if its secret is revealed is widely understood, not only by magicians but by the audiences they entertain. Most people enjoy the sense of mystery created by the performance, and do not want to ruin it.\n\nThe magician naturally wishes to preserve his secrets, so that he may go on earning his living from them, and this is widely recognized. He becomes, though, a victim of his own secrecy. The longer a trick is part of his repertoire, and the more often it is successfully performed, and by definition the larger the number of people he has deceived with it, then the more it seems to him essential to preserve its secret.\n\nThe effect grows larger. It is seen by many audiences, other magicians copy or adapt it, the magician himself will let it develop, so that his presentation changes over the years, making the trick seem more impossible to explain. Through all this the secret remains. It also remains small and trivial, and as the effect grows, so the triviality seems more threatening to his reputation. Secrecy becomes obsessive.\n\nSo to the real subject of this.\n\nI have spent my lifetime guarding my secret by appearing to shuffle (I am alluding to Ching Ling Foo, not, of course, writing literally). I am now of an age, and, frankly, of an earned wealth, where performing on stage has lost its charm. Am I therefore to limp figuratively for the rest of my natural life to preserve my secret? I think not, and so I have decided at last to change the habit of a lifetime and write about The New Transported Man. This is the name of the illusion that has made me famous. Many people said it was the greatest piece of magic ever performed on the international stage.\n\nI intend to write, firstly: a short description of what the audience sees.\n\nAnd then, secondly: A Revelation of the Secret behind it!\n\nSuch is the purpose of this account. Now I set aside my pen, as agreed.\n\nI have refrained from writing in this book for three weeks. I do not need to say why; I do not need to be told why. The secret of The New Transported Man is not mine alone to reveal, and there's an end to it. What madness infects me?\n\nThe secret has served me well for many years. I have spent most of my lifetime protecting it. Is this not reason enough for the Pact?\n\nUnder the Pact, if I once make a statement, I always assume responsibility for it as if I had spoken the words myself. As do I when roles are reversed, or so I have always assumed. For this reason, I do not insist that I go back and delete those lines above, where I promise a revelation of my secret. (For the same reason I may not later delete the very lines I am writing now.)\n\nHowever, no revelation of my secret maybe made, and is not even to be considered again. I must shuffle a while longer.\n\nI am ignoring the fact that Rupert Angier yet lives! I indeed sometimes put him from my mind, but the wretch continues to draw breath. So long as he remains alive, my secret is in danger.\n\nI hear he still performs his version of The New Transported Man, and during his execution of it continues to make that offensive remark across the footlights that what the audience is about to see \"has often been copied, but has never been improved upon\". Angier has found a new method of transportation, and it is said to look good when performed. His fatal flaw, though, is that his effect is slow. He still cannot do the trick as quickly as me! How he wants to know my truth!\n\nThe Pact must remain in place. No revelations!\n\nSince Angier has been brought into the story I shall describe the problem he first presented to me, and give a detailed account of how our dispute began. It will soon become apparent that I started the feud, and I assume this responsibility.\n\nHowever, I was led astray by clinging to what I thought were the highest principles, and when I realized what I had done I tried to make amends'. Here is how it started.\n\nWhen I first began, performing there was a vogue for spirit effects, or \"spiritism\". Some of these performances were given openly on the theatrical stage; others took place more secretly in studios or private homes. All had features in common. They allegedly gave hope to the grieving by making it seem that there was a life after death. Much money changed hands in pursuit of this reassurance.\n\nSpiritism had two significant features. First, the spirit magicians were using standard magical techniques. Second, they claimed that the effects were supernaturally produced. In other words, false claims were made about miraculous \"powers\".\n\nThis aggravated me. The tricks were all easily reproducible by any stage illusionist, and it was irritating to hear them claimed as paranormal phenomena, whose manifestation therefore \"proved\" that there was an afterlife, that spirits could walk, that the dead could speak, and so on. It was a lie, but it was difficult to prove.\n\nI arrived in London in 1874. Under John Henry Anderson's guidance, and Nevil Maskelyne's patronage, I began trying to obtain work in the theatres and music halls found all over the great capital. London was full of clever magicians and an entry into the circuit was not easy. I managed to take a modest place in that world.\n\nAt this time the spirit magicians were often, seen advertising their services in newspapers and periodicals, and some of their doings were much discussed. Spiritism was presented to the public as a more exciting, powerful and effective kind of magic than what they could see on the stage. If one is skilled enough to put a young woman into a trance and make her float in mid-air, they argued, why not direct that skill more usefully and communicate with the recently departed? Why not indeed?\n\nCHAPTER SIX.\n\nRupert Angier's name was already familiar to me. He was writing from somewhere in North London to the letter columns of two or three of the private magic journals. Angier was an opinionated and long-winded correspondent. His purpose was to pour scorn on older magicians, who with their secretive ways and courteous traditions were considered as tiresome relics of a former age. Although I worked within those traditions I did not participate in Angier's various disputes, but some of the magicians were greatly provoked by him.\n\nOne of his theories, for example, was that if magicians were as skillful as they claimed, then they should be prepared to perform magic \"in the round\". That is to say, the magician would be surrounded on all sides by the audience. He said that the magical effect would be increased if the illusion could be viewed from all angles. Secondly, if a small segment of the audience had to glimpse the secret, it did not matter! If five hundred people are baffled, he said, it was of no importance that five others should see the secret.\n\nSuch theories were almost heretical to the majority of professionals, because Angier's attitude to magic was radical and careless of the traditions, which had held good for so long.\n\nRupert Angier was therefore making a name for himself, but perhaps not the one he had planned. One observation I often heard was the mock surprise that Angier rarely performed on the public stage. His colleagues were therefore unable to admire his no doubt brilliant and innovative magic.\n\nAs I say, I did not involve myself, and he was of not great interest to me. However, destiny soon changed the situation.\n\nIt happened that one of my father's sisters, living in London, had recently become a widow and in her grief was intending to consult a spiritist. She had accordingly arranged a seance at her house. My professional curiosity was aroused, so I promptly made contact with my aunt, and volunteered to be with her in her search for solace.\n\nWhen the day came I was lucky that my aunt had invited me to lunch beforehand, because the spiritist arrived at the house at least an hour before he was expected. This threw the household into some confusion. I imagine it was part of his design, and enabled him to take certain preparations in the room for the seance. He and his two young assistants, one male and one female, darkened the room with black blinds. They moved unwanted furniture to the side while importing some of their own, rolled back the carpet to bare the floorboards, and erected a wooden cabinet whose size and appearance was enough to convince me that typical stage magic was going to be performed. I stayed in the background during these preparations. I did not wish to make myself at all interesting to the spiritist, because if he was alert he might have recognized me. The previous week my stage act was a success.\n\nThe spiritist himself was a young man of about my own age, thin, with dark hair and narrow forehead. He made quick precise movements with his hands, a sure sign of a long-practising prestidigitator. The young woman who worked with him had a slender, nimble body and a strong, attractive face. She wore dark and modest clothes, and rarely spoke. The other assistant, a muscular young man, had fair hair and a gloomy face.\n\nBy the time my aunt's other guests arrived, the spiritist's preparations were complete.\n\nThe presentation lasted for more than an hour, broke down into three main illusions, carefully arranged so as to create feelings of apprehension, excitement and suggestibility.\n\nFirst, the spiritist performed a table-tipping illusion with a dramatic physical effect; the table spun around of its own accord, then reared up terrifyingly. After this, the attendees were shaking with excited agitations and ready for anything that might follow. Then, with the aid of his female assistant, the spiritist fell into a trance. His assistants bound his hands and feet, and placed him within his cabinet. Soon numerous noisy, startling and inexplicable paranormal effects followed: strange lights flashed brilliantly, trumpets, cymbals and castanets sounded, and strange \"ectoplasmic matter\" rose of its own accord from the heart of the cabinet, and floated into the room illuminated by a mysterious light.\n\nThe spiritist then got down to his main business. After a short warning about the dangers of \"crossing over\" to the spirit world, he got in touch with the other side. Soon he was able to identify the spirit presence of certain departed relatives and close friends of the people gathered in the room, and comforting messages were conveyed from one group to the other.\n\nHow did the young spiritist achieve all this?\n\nDue to professional ethics I could not then, and cannot now, reveal more than the barest outline of the secrets of magical effects.\n\nThe tipping table is actually not a magic trick at all. It is a little-known physical phenomenon that if ten or a dozen people cluster around a circular wooden table, press the palms of their hands on the surface, and are then told that soon the table will start to rotate, it is only a matter of a minute or two before that starts to happen! Once the motion is felt, the table begins to tip to one side or the other. A skillfully placed foot suddenly lifting the appropriate table leg will dramatically unbalance the table, causing it to rear up.\n\nI need not emphasize that the table used at my aunt's was one of the spiritist's own props. It was constructed so that the four wooden legs connected to the central pillar in such a way that there was room for a foot to be slipped underneath.\n\nA skilled magician may easily escape from bonds, especially if the ropes and knots have been tied by two assistants. Once inside the cabinet it would be the work of a few seconds to release himself sufficiently to produce paranormal effects.\n\nAs for the \"psychic\" contacts, which were the main purpose of the meeting, here too there are standard techniques of forcing and substitution, which any good magician can readily perform.\n\nI had gone to my aunt's house to satisfy professional curiosity, but instead, to my eventual shame and regret, I came away with a case of righteous indignation. Standard stage illusions had been used to fool a group of suggestible and vulnerable people. My aunt, believing that she had heard words of comfort from her beloved husband, was so overcome by grief that she retired immediately to her chamber. Several of the others were almost as deeply moved by messages they had heard. Yet I knew, I alone knew, that it was all a fake.\n\nI felt that I could and should expose him as a charlatan, before he did any more harm. I was tempted to confront him then and there, but I was a little intimidated by the assured way he had performed his illusions. While he and his female assistant were putting away their apparatus, I spoke briefly to the young man and was given the spiritist's business card.\n\nSo I learned the name and style of the man who then tried to ruin my professional career:\n\nRupert Angier\n\nClairvoyant, Spirit Medium\n\nStrictest Confidence Observed\n\n45 Idmiston Villas, London N.\n\nI was young, inexperienced, inspired with what I saw as high principles, and these, to my later disappointment, blinded me to the hypocrisy of my position. I decided to expose Mr Angier's tricks. Soon I was able to establish where and when his next seance was to take place.\n\nOnce again, it was a meeting in a private house in a suburb of London, although this time I didn't have any connection with the family (grieving over the sudden death of the mother). I presented myself at the house the day before and said that I was an associate of Angier's who asked me to present. In their all-too-evident grief, the remaining family didn't care.\n\nThe next day I was in the street outside the house well before the appointment, and thus was able to confirm that Angier's own early arrival at my aunt's house had been no accident, and indeed was a necessary part of the preparations. I watched secretly as he and his assistants unpacked their equipment from a cart and carried it into the house. When I finally presented myself at the house an hour later, close to the appointed time, the room had been arranged and was in semi-darkness.\n\nThe seance began, as before, with the table-tipping trick, and I was standing close beside Angier as he readied himself to begin.\n\n\"Don't I know you, sir\"? he said softly and accusingly.\n\n\"I think not,\" I replied.\n\n\"Make a habit of these occasions, do you\"?\n\n\"No more than you, sir,\" I answered.\n\nEveryone was waiting for him so he had to begin. I think he knew from that moment that I was there to expose him, but he carried out his performance with the same elegance I had seen before.\n\nI wanted to wait until the emotional tension was at its greatest, when the supposed spirit messages were being sent. Angier performed this by using small scraps of paper, rolled up into little balls. The family had earlier written names, objects, family secrets and the like on these scraps, and Angier pretended to read their \"spirit\" messages by pressing the tiny balls to his forehead.\n\nWhen he had begun, I seized my chance. I stepped away from the table, breaking the chain of hands that was supposed to set up a psychic field, and snatched the blind down from the nearest window. Daylight flooded in.\n\nAngier said, \"What the devil-\"?\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen\"! I cried. \"This man is an impostor\"!\n\n\"Sit down, sir\"! The male assistant was moving quickly towards me.\n\n\"He is using legerdemain upon you\"! I said emphatically. \"Look in the hand that hides beneath the table's surface! There is the secret of the messages he brings you\"!\n\nAs the young man threw his arms around my shoulders, I saw Angier moving quickly and guiltily to conceal the slip of paper he held, by which the trick was effected. The father of the family, full of rage and grief, rose from his seat and began to scold me loudly. First, one of the children then the others began to cry with unhappiness.\n\nAs I struggled, the oldest boy said sadly, \"Where is Mama? She was here! She was here\"!\n\n\"This man is a charlatan, a liar and a cheat\"! I shouted.\n\nI was by this time almost at the door, forced backwards out of the room. I saw the young woman assistant hastening to the window to replace the blind. I managed to break free temporarily from my aggressor, and jumped across the room at her. I grabbed her by the shoulders. She fell down onto the floor.\n\n\"He cannot talk to the dead\"! I cried. \"Your mother is not here at all\"!\n\nThe room was in an uproar.\n\n\"Hold him there\"! Angier's voice was audible above the noise. The male assistant grabbed me a second time, and spun me around so that I was facing into the room. The young woman was still on the floor where she had fallen, and was staring up at me with hate. Angier, standing by the table, was erect and apparently calm. He was staring straight towards me.\n\n\"I know you, sir,\" he said. \"I even know your damned name. From this moment, I shall be following your career with the greatest attention\". Then he said to his assistant, \"Get him out of here\"!\n\nMoments later, I was outside. I straightened my clothes and walked quickly away down the street.\n\nFor a few days afterwards, I was confident of the righteousness of my cause. Then, inevitably, I began to have doubts.\n\nThe comfort that Angier's clients gained from the seances seemed genuine enough. I remembered the faces of those children, who for a few minutes had been led to believe that their lost mother was sending consoling messages from the other side. I had seen their innocent expressions, their smiles, their happy glances at each other.\n\nWas any of this so different from the pleasurable mystification a magician gives to his music hall audience? Indeed, was it not rather more? Was expecting payment for this more inacceptable than expecting payment for a performance at a music hall?\n\nFull of regrets I brooded unhappily for nearly a month, until my conscience reached such depths of guilty feelings that I had to act. I wrote a note to Angier, begging forgiveness, apologizing unconditionally.\n\nHis response was immediate. He returned my note in shreds, with a note of his own challenging me sarcastically to restore the paper with my own superior form of magic.\n\nTwo nights later, while I was performing at the Lewisham Empire, he stood up from the front row of the circle and shouted for all to hear, \"His female assistant is concealed behind the curtain at the left-hand side of the cabinet\"!\n\nIt was, of course, true. I had to continue with the trick, produce my assistant with as much theatrical enthusiasm as possible, then droop before the embarrassed applause. In the centre of the circle's front row, there was an empty seat.\n\nSo was begun the feud that has continued over the years.\n\nI can plead only youth and inexperience for starting the feud, a misguided professional passion, an unfamiliarity with the ways of the world. Angier should bear some of the blame; my apology, although not swift enough, was sincere and its rejection was cruel. But then, Angier too was young. It is difficult to think back to that time, because the dispute between us has gone on so long, and has taken so many different forms.\n\nMany of my performances failed because of his attacks. It could damage my reputation as a magician, as Angier well knew.\n\nHow did I know he was behind them? Well, in some cases, he clearly declared his involvement; if one of my productions had been sabotaged, he would be there in the auditorium, leaping to his feet at the very moment things started going wrong. But more significantly the attacker revealed an approach to magic that I had learned was symptomatic of Angier. He was almost exclusively concerned with the magical secret, what magicians call the \"gimac\" or \"gimmick\". If a trick depended on a concealed shelf behind the magician's table, that alone would be the focus of Angier's interest. No matter what else might cause conflict between us, it was Angier's fundamentally flawed and limited understanding of magical technique that was at the heart of our dispute. The wonder of magic lies not in the technical secret, but in the skill with which it is performed.\n\nAnd it was for this reason that The New Transported Man was the one illusion of mine he never publicly attacked. It was beyond him. He simply could not work out how it was done, partly because I have kept the secret secure, but mostly because of the way in which I perform it.\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\n\nAn illusion has three stages.\n\nFirst, there is the setup, in which the nature of what might be attempted is hinted at, or suggested, or explained. The apparatus is seen. Volunteers from the audience sometimes participate in the preparation. During the setup, the magician will make every possible use of misdirection.\n\nThe performance is where the magician's skill as a performer produces the magical display.\n\nThe third stage is sometimes called the effect, or the prestige, and this is the product of magic. If a rabbit is pulled from a hat, the rabbit, which apparently did not exist before the trick was performed, can be called the prestige of that trick.\n\nThe New Transported Man is fairly unusual among illusions because the setup and performance are what most intrigue audiences, critics and my magical colleagues, while for me, the performer, the prestige is the main preoccupation.\n\nMagic has no mystery to magicians. What will seem new or inexplicable to an audience is simply a technical challenge for other professionals. If an innovative new illusion is developed, it is only a matter of time before the effect is reproduced by others.\n\nEvery illusion can be explained, for example, by the use of a concealed compartment, by a skillfully placed mirror, by an assistant planted in the audience to act as \"volunteer\", or by simple misdirection of the audience's attention.\n\nThe New Transported Man is an illusion like every other, and it can be explained. But by a combination of a simple secret that has been kept securely, many years of practice, a certain amount of audience misdirection, and the use of conventional magic techniques it has become the keystone of my act and my career. It has also resisted Angier's best efforts to penetrate its mystery, as I shall soon record.\n\nSarah and I have been with the children on a short holiday along the south coast, and I took my notebook with me.\n\nMy first comment on the notebook is that it was I who tried to humiliate Angier, and I, in turn, who was humiliated by him. Other than this detail, which is after all not too important, I think my account of what happened is accurate, even in its other details.\n\nI do not think my secret is trivial. It is easily guessed, as Angier has apparently done, in spite of what I have written. Others have probably guessed too.\n\nWhat cannot be guessed is the effect the secret has had on my life. This is the real reason Angier will never solve the whole mystery, unless I myself give him the answer. He would never imagine the extent to which my life has been shaped towards holding the secret intact. That is what matters.\n\nThe New Transported Man is an illusion whose appearance has changed over the years, but whose method has always remained the same.\n\nIt has progressively involved two cabinets, or two boxes, or two tables, or two benches. One is situated in the downstage area, the other is upstage. The only important feature of their positioning is that both pieces should be clearly and widely separated from each other. The apparatus is brightly lit and in full view of the audience from beginning to end.\n\nI shall describe the oldest, and therefore the simplest, version of the trick, when I was using closed cabinets. At that time, I called the illusion The Transported Man.\n\nBoth cabinets are brought onto the stage, and both are shown to be empty. Volunteers are allowed to examine them. Then the cabinets are closed.\n\nAfter a short, humorous preamble (delivered in my French accent) about the desirability of being in two places at once, I go to the nearer of the two cabinets, the first, and open the door.\n\nIt is, of course, still empty. I take a large, brightly coloured inflatable ball from my props table, and bounce it a couple of times to show how vigorously it moves. I step into the first cabinet, leaving the door open.\n\nI bounce the ball in the direction of the second cabinet.\n\nFrom within, I slam closed the door of the first cabinet.\n\nFrom within, I push open the door of the second cabinet, and step out. I catch the ball as it bounces towards me.\n\nAs the ball enters my hands, the first cabinet collapses, the door and three walls are folding out dramatically to show that it is completely empty.\n\nHolding the ball, I step forward to the footlights, and acknowledge my applause.\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\n\nLet me briefly review my life and career up to the last years of the century.\n\nBy the time, I was 18, I had left home and was working the music halls as a full-time magician. However, even with help from Mr Maskelyne, jobs were hard to find, and I became neither famous nor rich and did not earn my own place on the bill for several years. Mostly, I was assisting other magicians with their performances, but for a long time I paid the rent by designing and building cabinets and other magical apparatus. My father's cabinet-making training helped me a lot. I built a reputation as a reliable inventor and ingenieur of stage illusions.\n\nIn 1879 my mother died, followed a year later by my father.\n\nBy the end of the 1880s, when I was in my early thirties, I had developed my own solo act and adopted the stage name Le Professeur de la Magie. I regularly performed The Transported Man in its various early forms.\n\nAlthough the working of the illusion was never a problem, I was for a long time dissatisfied with the stage effects. It always seemed to me that closed cabinets were not sufficiently mysterious to raise audience expectations of peril and impossibility. In 1892, though, came the idea I had been seeking. It happened indirectly, and the seed it sowed took a long time to develop.\n\nA Balkan inventor by the name of Nikola Tesla came to London in the February of that year to promote certain new effects he was then pioneering in the field of electricity. Tesla was going to deliver several lectures about his speciality to the scientific community. It turned out that Mr Tesla was a controversial figure in the USA, involved in scientific disputes about the nature and application of electricity, and there were many reports about him in the newspapers. It was from these articles that I gathered my ideas.\n\nI had always needed a spectacular stage effect, partly to highlight the effect of The Transported Man, and partly to mask it's working. I gathered from the news reports that Mr Tesla was able to generate high voltages, which could be made to flash and spark about, harmlessly, and without suffering burns.\n\nAfter Mr Tesla had returned to the United States, London and other cities began supplying small amounts of electricity to those who could afford to buy it. Sometime later, when I heard that Angier was going to imitate The Transported Man, I began to think I should develop the illusion once again. I realized that without much difficulty I could probably apply electricity to my requirements and began a search through London scientific dealers. With the assistance of Tommy Elbourne, my ingenieur, I eventually managed to build stage equipment for The New Transported Man. My illusion worked in a blinding flash of electrical light.\n\nI will go back now. In October 1891, I had married Sarah Henderson, whom I had met while I was taking part in a charity show performed in a Salvation Army hostel in Aldgate. She was one of the volunteer helpers, and during the interval in our performance, she had sat informally with me while we both drank tea. My card tricks had amused her, and she teasingly challenged me to perform some more for her alone, so that she might see how I did them. Because she was young and pretty I did so, and greatly enjoyed the bafflement I saw in her eyes.\n\nThis was the first and the last time I performed magic for her. My skill as a prestidigitator simply became irrelevant to our feelings about each other. We became walking-out companions soon after our meeting, and it was not long before we admitted to each other that we were in love. Sarah has no background in the theatre or the music halls. In fact, she was a young woman of noble origin. She proved her devotion to me: even after her father threatened to disinherit her, which, of course, he eventually did, she remained true to me.\n\nAfter our marriage we moved to rented rooms in the Bayswater area of London, but we did not have long to wait before I achieved success. In 1893, we bought the large house in St Johns Wood where we have lived ever since. In the same year our twin children, Graham and Helena, were born.\n\nI have always kept my professional life separate from my family life. During the period I am describing I practised my profession from my office and workshop in Elgin Avenue, and when touring shows took me abroad or to remoter parts of Britain, I did not take Sarah with me. When I was in London, or between shows, I lived quietly and contentedly at home with her.\n\nI stress my contented domestic life because of what soon happened.\n\nShall I continue?\n\nI think I must; yes. I suspect I know to what I am referring here.\n\nI had been advertising in theatrical journals for a replacement lady assistant, because my existing young woman, Georgina Harris, was planning to marry. I always dreaded the trouble caused by the arrival of a new member of staff, especially one so important as the stage assistant. When Olive Wenscombe wrote and applied for an interview, she did not seem immediately suitable, and her letter went unanswered for some time.\n\nShe was, she said in her letter, twenty-six. This was a little older than I wanted. She described herself as a trained danseuse who had moved over to the work of magical assistant. I have always preferred to employ young women with specific magical experience, rather than those who took it up simply because a job had been offered to them at some time in the past. Nevertheless, Olive Wenscombe's letter came during one of those times when good assistants were hard to find, and so I finally made an appointment with her.\n\nOlive Wenscombe's interview took place at my workshop in Elgin Avenue. Here, in opened cabinets, mirrored cubes and curtained alcoves, were laid bare many of the incidental secrets of my business. But the only illusion whose secret I guarded carefully was The New Transported Man, and its working was concealed even from the young woman who shared the stage with me until the moment before the illusion began.\n\nI do not work entirely alone, nor does any modern illusionist. In addition to my stage assistants, Thomas Elbourne, my irreplaceable ingenieur, worked for me and two of his own young artisans, who helped him, build and maintain the apparatus. Thomas had been with me almost from the start.\n\n(Thomas Elbourne knew my most guarded secret; he had to. But I trusted him, I had to. I say this as simply as possible, to convey the simplicity of my belief in him. Thomas had worked with magicians all his life, and nothing any more surprised him. I learnt from him a lot. Yet he never revealed the secret of another magician to me or to anyone else, in all the years I worked with him - he retired several years ago. To call his trust into question would be to question my sanity. Thomas was a Londoner from Tottenham, a married man without children. He was many years older than me, but I never discovered exactly how many. At the time Olive Wenscombe began working for me I assume he was about seventy.)\n\nI decided to employ Olive Wenscombe almost as soon as she arrived. She was neither tall nor broad, but had an attractive and slim body. She held her head erect as she walked or stood, and her face had well-defined features. She was American-born, and had an accent she identified as East Coast, but had lived and worked in London for several years. I introduced her as informally as possible to Thomas Elbourne and Georgina Harris, then asked her if she had brought any references with her. I generally gave references a great deal of weight when assessing an applicant, because a recommendation from a magician whose work I knew would almost certainly gain the applicant the job. Olive had brought two such references with her, one was from a magician whose name I did not recognize, but the other was from Joseph Buatier de Kolta, one of the greatest living performers. I was, I admit, impressed. I quietly passed de Kolta's letter to Thomas Elbourne, and watched his expression.\n\n\"How long did you work for Monsieur de Kolta\"? I asked her.\n\n\"Only for five months,\" she said. \"I was hired for a tour of Europe, and he let me go at the end of it\".\n\n\"So I see\".\n\nAfter that, employing her was something of a formality, but even so, I subjected her to the usual tests.\n\n\"Did you bring a rehearsal costume with you\"? I said.\n\n\"Yes, sir, I did\".\n\n\"Then if you would be so kind-\"\n\nOlive Wenscombe proved herself most suitable by all the usual tests, and I retained her at the customary wage. Within a week, I had trained her to perform in all the illusions in my repertoire where she would be needed. Soon, Georgina left to marry her admirer, and Olive took her place as my full-time assistant.\n\nHow neat it all seems when I write it down, how calm and professional! Now I have written the \"official\" version of Olive, let me under our Pact add the truth I have so far concealed from all those who matter most. Olive nearly made a fool of me, and the true account must be given.\n\nGeorgina wasn't present at the interview, of course. Nor was I. Tommy Elbourne was there, but, as always, he kept out of the way. She and I were alone in my workshop.\n\nI asked Olive about a costume, and she said she hadn't brought one. She looked me straight in the eye when she said this, and there was a long silence while I thought about what that meant. No young woman applying for the job would expect to be hired without being tested in some way. Applicants always brought a rehearsal costume.\n\nWell, Olive apparently had not. Then she said, \"I don't need a costume, honey\".\n\nShe promptly took off her outer clothes, and what she was wearing beneath was of the boudoir; she was left in garments that were immodest. I took her to the Palanquin, where although she obviously knew what it was and where she had to conceal herself, she asked me to help her climb inside. This required much intimate handling of her semi- clad body! The same happened when I showed her the mechanism of another trick. She pretended to stumble and fell into my arms. The rest of the interview was conducted on the couch at the back of the workshop. Tommy Elbourne left quietly, without either of us noticing. He was not there afterwards, anyway.\n\nThe rest is substantially correct. I took her on, and she learned how to operate all the illusions in which I needed her.\n\nCHAPTER NINE.\n\nMy performance always opens with the Chinese Linking Rings. Audiences love to watch it, no matter if they have seen it before. It is a trick impossible to see through, unless you are standing a few inches away from the performer and are able to take the rings away from him. It always charms, always creates that electrifying sense of mystery and miracle.\n\nThen I roll forward the Modern Cabinet, which has been standing upstage. A yard or so from the footlights I rotate the cabinet to show both sides and the back. I open the door to reveal the interior, then step inside to release the catch that holds the rear panel in place, the audience can see right through from front to back. They see me pass through and close the back wall once more. The door hangs open, and while I am apparently busy behind the cabinet, they look more intently at the interior. Quickly, then, I slam the front door closed, rotate the cabinet, and throw open the door. Inside, beautifully dressed, smiling and waving her arms, entirely filling the interior of the cabinet, is a young woman. She steps down, takes her bow to loud applause and leaves the stage.\n\nI roll the cabinet to the side of the stage, and Thomas Elbourne quietly rolls it back behind the curtains.\n\nSo to the next. Every magic act includes a few moments with a pack of cards. The magician must show his skill with sleight of hand, otherwise his professional colleagues might think he is merely an operator of self-working machinery. I walk to the footlights, and the curtains close behind me. This is partly to create a closed, intimate atmosphere for the card tricks, but mainly so that behind them Thomas may set up the apparatus for The New Transported Man.\n\nWith the cards finished, I acknowledge the applause.\n\nWhile the audience is still clapping the curtains open behind me, and in semi-darkness, my apparatus for The New Transported Man may be seen.\n\nThen I address the audience directly, in my French- accented English. I explain that what I am going to perform has become possible only since the discovery of electricity. The performance draws power from the bowels of the Earth. Unimaginable forces are at work that even I do not fully understand. I explain that they are about to witness a real miracle, one in which life and death have equal chances.\n\nWhile I speak the stage lights brighten, and catch the polished metal supports, the golden coils of wire, the glistening globes of glass. The apparatus is a thing of beauty, but it is a threatening beauty because everyone by now has heard for themselves of some of the deadly power of the electrical current. Newspapers have carried accounts of horrible deaths and burns caused by the new force already available in many cities.\n\nThe apparatus of The New Transported Man is designed to remind them of these accounts. It carries numerous glowing electric lamps, some of which come alight even as I speak. At one side is a large glass globe, inside which a brilliant arc of electricity fizzes and crackles. The main part of the apparatus appears, to the audience, to be a long wooden bench, three feet above the floor of the stage. They can see past it, around it, underneath it. At one end, by the arc-lit glass chamber, is a small raised platform with hanging wires. Above the platform is a canopy with many bright lamps. At the further end is a metal cone, decorated with a spiral of smaller glowing lamps. This is mounted on a device that allows it to be rotated in several directions. The whole thing is producing a loud humming noise.\n\nI explain to the audience that I would invite some of its members on to the stage to examine the device for themselves, but for the immense danger to them. I hint at earlier accidents. Instead, I say, I have made a few simple demonstrations of the power within the machine. I allow some magnesium powder to fall across two bared contacts, and a brilliant white flash momentarily blinds the members of the audience closest to the stage! While the smoke from it goes upwards, I take a sheet of paper and drop it across another semi-concealed part of the apparatus; this immediately bursts into flame, and its smoke also rises dramatically. The humming sound increases in volume. The apparatus seems to be alive, only barely constraining the frightful energies that lie within.\n\nThen my female assistant appears with a wheeled cabinet. This is strongly made of wood, but because it is built on wheels, she is able to turn the thing around so it might be seen from all sides. Then she lets down the front and sides to show that it is empty.\n\nI grimace sadly at the audience then signal to the girl, who brings to me two large dark-brown gloves, made to seem as if they are of leathern material. When these are covering my hands, she leads me to the apparatus, until I stand behind it. The audience can see most of my body still, and satisfy themselves that there are no concealed mirrors or shields. I lower my two gloved hands to the surface of the platform, and as I do so the sound of electrical tension increases, and there is another brilliant discharge of electrical energy. I move back, as if in shock.\n\nI ask the girl to leave the stage for her own safety. At first she resists, then gladly hurries away.\n\nI reach up to the turning cone, grip it cautiously with my gloved hands, and move it with great care until it is pointed directly at the cabinet.\n\nThe illusion is approaching its climax. From the orchestra pit, there comes a roll of drums. I place both hands on the platform once more, and magically all the remaining lamps shine out brightly. I first sit on the platform, and swivel around so that I can stretch my legs out, then lower myself until I am lying full length in the terrible electrical forces.\n\nI raise my arms, and pull off first one, then the other glove. As I lower my arms, I allow my hands to droop below the level of the platform.\n\nThere is a brilliant, blinding flash of light, and all the lights on the apparatus fuse into darkness.\n\nIn the same instant... I vanish from the platform.\n\nThe cabinet bursts open, and I am seen inside, hunched up.\n\nI roll slowly out of the cabinet, and collapse on to the floor. I am bathed in stage lights. Gradually I come to my senses. I stand. I blink in the brightness of the lights. I face the audience. I turn towards the platform, indicate where I had been, turn back to the cabinet immediately behind me, and indicate where I had arrived.\n\nI take my bow.\n\nThe audience has seen me transmogrified. Before their eyes, I was catapulted by the power of electricity from one part of the stage to another. Ten feet of empty space. Twenty feet, thirty feet, depending on the size of the stage.\n\nA human body transmitted in an instant. A miracle, an impossibility, an illusion.\n\nMy assistant returns to the stage. Clasping her hand I am smiling and bowing as the applause rings out and the curtains close before me.\n\nIf I say no more of this, it will be acceptable. I shall not intervene again. I may continue to the conclusion.\n\nCHAPTER TEN.\n\nLife in my flat in Hornsey, an area of north London several miles from my house in St Johns Wood, left much to be desired. I had chosen the flat, one of ten in an apartment house in a quiet side street, simply because its anonymity fulfilled my needs. It was on the second floor at the rear of a modest, mid-century building, occupying one of the comers, so that although it had several windows looking out into the surrounding small garden, entry to it was by a single plain door leading off the stairwell.\n\nSoon I began to regret the choice. Most of the other tenants were lower-middle-class families; all the other flats on my floor had children living in them. My single state, especially in a flat of such a size, obviously aroused the curiosity of my neighbours. Eventually I believe I became dull to them. The English have a traditional tolerance of eccentrics, and my late-night arrivals, my solitary presence without servants, my unexplained method of making my living, came eventually to seem harmless.\n\nI had rented the flat unfurnished, and because I was spending most of my earnings on the family house in St Johns Wood, at first I could only afford cheap and uncomfortable furniture. But the worst was the loneliness and the feeling of being cut off from my family. There has never been any cure for this, then or now. Even at first, when it was just Sarah from whom I was separated, it was intolerable. It became even more difficult, after Graham and Helena were born, especially when one of them fell ill. Although I knew that my family was looked after with love, and that our servants were dedicated and trustworthy, this was never quite enough.\n\nIn the years when I had been planning The Transported Man and my overall magical career, it had never occurred to me that having a family might one day threaten to make it unworkable.\n\nMany times, I have been tempted to give up the stage, and always because I have felt calls of affection and duty to my lovely wife, and of love for my children.\n\nIn those long days in the Hornsey flat, and sometimes in the weeks when the theatrical season gave no openings for my act, I had a lot of time to reflect.\n\nThe significant point is, of course, that I did not give up.\n\nI kept going through the difficult early years. I kept going when my reputation and earnings began to increase. And I keep going now when most of what remains of my famous illusion is the mystery that surrounds it.\n\nHowever, things have been a lot easier recently. During the first two weeks that Olive Wenscombe was working for me, I discovered that she was staying in a commercial hotel. Explaining why, she told me that the Hampshire magician had provided lodgings with his job, but she had given these up when she left his employ. By this time, Olive and I were making regular use of the couch at the rear of my workshop, and I realized that my employ too might offer her permanent lodgings.\n\nThe Pact controlled all decisions of such a nature, but in this case, it was just a formality. A few days later, Olive moved into my flat in Hornsey. There she stayed, and has stayed, ever since.\n\nHer revelation, that changed everything, came a few weeks later.\n\nTowards the end of 1898, a theatre cancellation meant that there was more than a week between performances of The New Transported Man. I spent the time in the Hornsey flat with Olive. We began redecorating the flat and bought several attractive items of furniture.\n\nThe night before the idyll was going to end - I had planned to take my show to the Hippodrome in Brighton - she sprung her surprise. It was late at night, and we were resting together before falling asleep.\n\n\"Listen, honey\"! she said. \"I've been thinking you might want to start looking around for a new assistant\".\n\nI was so thunderstruck that at first I did not know how to answer. Until that moment it had seemed to me I had reached the kind of stability, I had been seeking all my working life. I had my family, I had my mistress. I lived in my house with my wife, and I stayed in my flat with my lover. I worshipped my children, adored my wife, loved my mistress. My life was in two distinct halves, kept apart; neither side was suspecting the other even existed. In addition, my lover worked as my beautiful and fascinating stage assistant. She was not only brilliant at her job but her lovely appearance, I was certain, had doubtless helped me obtain the much larger audiences I had been playing to since she joined me. Now, with those words, Olive seemed to be unbalancing everything, and I was thrown into dismay.\n\nSeeing my reaction, Olive said, \"I got a lot I want to get off my chest. It isn't so bad as maybe you think\".\n\n\"I can't imagine how it could be much worse\".\n\n\"Well, if you hear half of what I say, it'll be worse than you ever imagined, but if you hear it all, I guess you'll feel good\". I took a careful look at her and noticed that she was tense. The story came out in a flood of words, quickly confirming her warning. What she said filled me with horror.\n\nShe began by saying that she wanted to stop working for me for two reasons. The first was that she simply wanted a change. She said she wished to live at home, be my lover, follow my career from that standpoint. She said she would continue to work as my assistant as long as I asked her to, or until I could find a replacement. So far so good. But, she said, I hadn't yet heard the second reason. This was that she had been sent to work for me by someone who wanted to know my professional secrets. This man -\n\n\"It's Angier\"! I exclaimed. \"You were sent to spy on me by Rupert Angier\"?\n\nTo this, she readily confessed, and seeing my anger she moved back and away from me, then began to weep. Mymind was racing as I tried to remember everything I had said to her in the preceding weeks, and to recall what apparatus she had seen or used, what secrets she might have learned or discovered for herself, and what she had been able to communicate back to my enemy.\n\nFor a time I became unable to listen to her, unable to think calmly or logically. For much of the same time she was weeping, imploring me to listen to her.\n\nTwo or three hours passed in this distressing and unproductive way, then at last we reached a point of emotional numbness. The need for sleep made us turn out the light. We lay down together: our habits Were not yet broken by the terrible revelation.\n\nI lay awake in the darkness, trying to think how to deal with this, but my mind was still circling distractedly. Then out of the dark beside me I heard her say quietly, insistently, \"Don't you realize that if I was still Rupert Angier's spy I would not have told you? Yes, I was with him but I was bored with him. And he'd been messing around with some other lady, and it annoyed me. All the time he was obsessed with attacking you, and I needed a change and so I cooked up this idea myself. But when I met you... well, I felt differently. You're so unlike Rupert in everything. You know what happened, and all that was real between us, right? Rupert thinks I'm spying for him, but I guess by now he's realized he isn't going to hear anything back from me. I want to stop being your assistant because so long as I'm up there doing the act with you, Rupert's waiting for me to do what he wants.\n\nI just want to get out of it all, live here in this apartment, be with you, Alfred. You know, I think I love you -\"\n\nAnd so on, long into the night.\n\nIn the morning, in the grey light of a rainy dawn, I said to her, \"I have decided what to do. Why don't you take a message back to Angier? I will tell you what to say, and you will deliver it, telling him it's the secret for which he has been searching. You may say whatever you wish to make him believe that you stole the secret from me, and that it is the prime information he has been seeking. After that, if you return, and if you then swear that you will never again have anything to do with Angier, and if, and only if, you can make me believe you, then we will start our lives together again. Do you agree\"?\n\n\"I will do it today,\" she swore. \"I want to put Angier out of my life forever\"!\n\n\"First I have to go to my workshop. I have to decide what I can safely tell Angier\".\n\nWithout further explanation, I left her in the flat and took the omnibus to Elgin Avenue.\n\nThe problem was discussed fully when I arrived at the workshop. Although potentially serious, it was just one of several crises the Pact has had to confront over the years. It was not easy, but at the end of it, the Pact was as strong as ever. Indeed, as a recordable testament of my continued faith in the Pact, I can say that it was I who remained in the workshop while I returned to the flat.\n\nHere I dictated to Olive what she should inscribe on the sheet of paper, in her own handwriting. She wrote it down, tense but determined to do what she saw as necessary. The message was intended to send Angier searching in the wrong direction, so it needed to be not only believable but something he would not have thought of on his own.\n\nShe left Hornsey with the message at 2 25 pm, and did not return to the flat until after 11 00 pm.\n\n\"It is done\"! she cried. \"He has the information I gave him. I hope I will never see him again, and I certainly will never again speak a friendly word about or to him\".\n\nI never enquired what had taken place during those eight and a half hours she was absent, and why it had taken her so long to deliver a written message. She innocently explained that she had not found Angier immediately: he had been in performance in another part of the city. That is probably true. But as that long evening went by I had many grim fantasies about double agents.\n\nHowever, all this occurred at the end of 1898, and I write these words at the end of the historic month of January 1901. (The day before I wrote these words Her Majesty the Queen was finally laid to rest, and the country is at last emerging from a period of mourning.) Olive remains with me, true to my wishes. My career continues smoothly, my position in the world of illusions is firm, my family is growing, my wealth is secure. I run two peaceful households. Rupert Angier has not attacked me since Olive passed him the false information. All is quiet around me, and after the turbulent years, I am at last settled in my life.\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\n\nI write, unwillingly, in the year 1903. I had planned to leave my notebook closed forever, but events have worked against me.\n\nRupert Angier has died suddenly. He was forty-six, only a year younger than myself. His death, according to a notice in The Times, was caused by complications following injuries suffered while performing a stage illusion at a theatre in Suffolk.\n\nI had already suspected he was ill. The last time I saw him he was weak, and I guessed he was the victim of some chronic ailment.\n\nI can summarize the published obituaries, which I have before me as I write. He was born in Derbyshire in 1857, but had moved to London at a young age, where he had worked for many years as an illusionist and prestidigitator, achieving a considerable measure of success. He had performed his act throughout the British Isles and Europe, and had toured the New World three times. He was credited with inventing several notable stage illusions, in particular one called Bright Morning (it involved releasing an assistant from what looked like a sealed flask held in full view of the audience), and this had been widely imitated. More recently, he had successfully devised an illusion called In a Flash, which he was performing at the time of the fatal accident. A master of legerdemain, Angier had been a popular performer at small or private gatherings. He was married, had fathered a son and two daughters, and until the end had lived with his family in the Highgate area of London. He had been performing regularly until the accident, which led to his death.\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\n\nIt gives me no pleasure to write of Angier's death. It has come as a tragic climax to a sequence of events, which had been building up for more than two years.\n\nAs I noted in the earlier part of this journal, I had reached a state of pleasant balance and stability in my life and career, and had no wish for anything more than what I had at that time. I felt and sincerely believed that if Angier made any kind of attack against me I could merely ignore it. Indeed, I had every reason to believe that the trail of false clues offered in Olive's note to him was a concluding action between us. It was intended to put him off course, to send him searching for a secret that did not exist. The fact that he vanished from my awareness for more than two years suggested my trick had worked.\n\nHowever, soon after I had completed the first part of this narrative I read a magazine review of a show-taking place at the Finsbury Park Empire. Rupert Angier was one of the acts. The notice mentioned him only in passing, observing \"it is good to acknowledge that his talent remains undimmed\". This in itself suggested that his career had been going through a pause.\n\nTwo or three months later, all had changed. One of the magic journals published an interview with him. One of the daily newspapers referred in an article to the \"revival of the prestidigitator's art\", pointing out that numerous magical acts were once again topping the bill in our music halls. Rupert Angier was mentioned by name, among few others.\n\nLater, one of the journals published a detailed article about Angier. It described his present act as a triumphant departure in the art of open magic. His new illusion, called In a Flash, was specially mentioned. The article said that it set new standards of technical brilliance, and it was unlikely that any other illusionist would be able to reproduce its effect. The same article mentioned that In a Flash was a significant development from \"previous efforts\" in the field of transference illusions, and there was an offensive reference not only to The New Transported Man but also to myself.\n\nI tried, I honestly tried, to disregard such remarks, but these mentions in the press were only the first of many to come. Unquestionably, Rupert Angier was at the top of our profession.\n\nI decided I had to see Angier's new illusion for myself, and when I heard at the end of October that he was starting a two-week residence at the Hackney Empire quietly bought myself a ticket for the stalls. My seat had a good view of the stage, but I was not so close that Angier was likely to spot me there.\n\nIn the main part of his performance, he competently performed illusions from the standard magical repertoire. His style was good, his assistant beautiful, and his showmanship above average. During this part of his act, though, I first observed the disease that was affecting his face, and saw other clues that suggested an unwell state. He moved stiffly, and several times didn't use his left arm as if it were weaker than the other.\n\nFinally, Angier came to the closing illusion. He began with a serious speech, which I scribbled down quickly into a notebook. Here is what he said:\n\nLadies and Gentlemen! As the new century moves apace, we see around us on every side the miracles of science. These wonders multiply almost every day. Yet no miracle which science may produce can compare with the greatest wonders of all the human mind and the human body.\n\nTonight, ladies and gentlemen, I will attempt a magical act that brings together the wonders of science and the wonders of the human mind. No other stage performer in the world can reproduce what you are about to witness for yourself!\n\nWith this, he raised his good arm theatrically, and the curtains were swept apart. There, waiting in the spotlight, was the apparatus I had come to see.\n\nIt was substantially larger than I had expected. Magicians normally prefer to work with compactly built apparatus. Angier's equipment practically filled the stage area.\n\nIn the centre of the stage was an arrangement of three long metal legs, joined tripodally at the apex and supporting a shining metal globe about a foot and a half in diameter. There was just room beneath the apex of the tripod for a man to stand. Immediately above the apex, and below the globe, was a cylindrical wooden and metal mechanism firmly attached to the joint. This cylinder was made of wooden slats with distinct gaps between them, and wound around hundreds of times with thin filaments of wires. From where I was sitting, I judged the cylinder to be at least four feet in height, and perhaps as many in diameter. It was slowly rotating, and catching and reflecting the stage lights into our eyes.\n\nSurrounding the mechanism, at a radial distance of about ten feet was a second circle of eight metal slats, again much wound around with wires. These were standing on the surface of the stage and concentric to the tripod. The slats were widely and evenly spaced, with a large gap between each one. The audience could see clearly into the main part of the apparatus.\n\nI was totally unprepared for this, as I had been expecting some kind of magical cabinet of the same general size as the ones I used. Angier's apparatus was so huge that there was no room anywhere on the stage for a second concealing cabinet.\n\nMy magician's brain started racing, trying to anticipate the illusion, how it might differ from my own, and where the secret might lie. First impression - surprise at the sheer size of it. Second impression - the remarkable ordinary quality of the apparatus. There was no use of bright colours or distracting lights. Third impression - no hint of what was going to come.\n\nAngier began his performance of the trick.\n\nEvery part of the apparatus could be seen directly, and as Angier went through his preparations, he walked about the stage, always visible. I watched his legs, often a part of an illusionist's anatomy to observe closely when he moves around and particularly behind his apparatus, (an inexplicable movement can indicate the presence of a mirror or some other device) but Angier's walk was relaxed and normal. There were no trapdoors that he could use. The stage was covered in a single large rubber sheet.\n\nMeanwhile, Angier faced his audience.\n\n\"Good sirs, mesdames, I request of one of you, a volunteer. You need not fear for what might happen. I require you for a simple act of verification only\".\n\nAfter the usual nervous hesitation, a man stepped forward and mounted the stage by the side ramp. As he did so, one of Angier's assistants walked on to the stage, carrying a tray with several articles; each of them offered a means of marking or identifying. There were two or three wells filled with different coloured inks; there was a bowl of flour; there were some chalks; there were sticks of charcoal. Angier invited the volunteer to choose one, and when the man selected the bowl of flour, Angier turned his back on him and invited him to tip it across the back of his jacket. This the man did.\n\nAngier turned again to face the audience, and asked the volunteer to select one of the inks. The man chose the red. Angier held out his hands so that red ink might be poured across them.\n\nNow distinctively marked, Angier requested the man to return to his seat.\n\nThere was an unearthly crackling noise, and to my amazement, a bolt of blue-white electrical discharge abruptly curled out and away from the shining globe. The arc moved with a horrid suddenness, dashing about inside the arena enclosed by the outer slats, into which Angier himself now walked.\n\nThe electrical discharge abruptly doubled, then tripled, with the extra bolts snaking around, as if searching the enclosed space. One inevitably found Angier, and instantly wrapped itself around him. He welcomed the shot of electricity, raising his good arm, turning about, allowing the snaking, hissing fire to encircle him and surround him.\n\nAs more streaming arcs of electricity swooped about him, Angier moved to the tripod at the heart of the inferno, directly beneath the source. Once here he seemed safe. Apparently unable or unwilling to double back on themselves, the brilliant arcs of light snapped away from him.\n\nSo these eight dazzling streamers formed a kind of covering above the arena in which Angier stood, alone. The spotlight was suddenly extinguished, and all other stage lights had been dimmed. He was illuminated only by the light that fell on him from the discharge. He stood immobile, his good arm was raised, his head was barely an inch or so below the metal cylinder from where all the electricity came.\n\nHe lowered his arms, and for two or three seconds stood in silence, submitting to the awful spectacle he had made.\n\nThen he vanished.\n\nOne moment Angier was there, the next he was not. His apparatus made a shrieking, tearing sound, and appeared to shake, but with his going, the bright remains of energy instantly died. The stage fell into darkness.\n\nI was standing; without fully realizing it, I had been standing for some time. I, and the rest of the audience, stood there amazed. The man had disappeared in front of our eyes, leaving no trace.\n\nI heard a commotion in the aisle behind me, and I turned to see what was happening. There were too many heads and bodies, I could not see clearly, some kind of motion in the darkened auditorium! Thankfully, the house lights came on, and one of the operated spotlights turned from its position high above the boxes, and its light picked out what was going on.\n\nAngier was there!\n\nMembers of the theatre's staff were hurrying down the aisle towards him, and some of the audience were trying to get to him, but he was on his feet and pushing them away from him.\n\nHe was staggering down the aisle, heading back towards the stage.\n\nI tried to recover from the surprise, and quickly made estimates. No more than a second or two passed between his disappearance from the stage, and his reappearance in the aisle. I glanced to the stage, trying to work out the distance involved.\n\nWas it possible that he dashed one hundred feet in a single second, while the darkness from the stage masked his movement?\n\nIt was then, and is now, a rhetorical question. Clearly, he could not, without the use of magical techniques.\n\nBut which ones?\n\nAngier's face was tormented, his whole body moved as if racked with pain. He shambled like a drunk or an invalid, or a man finally exhausted with life. I saw his left arm hanging limply by his side. On the back of his jacket, the burst of flour was still visible.\n\nWe were all applauding, with many people cheering and whistling their approval, and as he neared the stage, a second spotlight picked him out and tracked him up the ramp to the stage. He walked wearily to the centre of the stage, where at last he seemed to recover. Once more in the full glare of the stage lights, he took his ovation, bowing to the audience, acknowledging them, blowing kisses, smiling and triumphant. I stood with the rest, marveling at what I had seen.\n\nI did not know how the trick was done! I had seen it with my own eyes, and I had watched in the knowledge of how to watch a magician at work, and I had looked in all the places from which a magician traditionally misdirects his audience. I left the Hackney Empire in a boiling rage. I was angry that my best illusion had been copied; I was even angrier that it had been bettered. Worst of all, though, was the fact that I could not work out how it was done.\n\nHe was one man. He was in one place. He appeared in another. He could not have a double, equally, it was impossible that he could travel so quickly from one position to the other.\n\nI returned to my flat in Hornsey, where at that time I happened to be staying, and underwent a sleepless night, tossing restlessly beside Olive.\n\nThe next day I settled down to some hard and practical thinking about his version of my trick, to see what I could make of it.\n\nI confess yet again: I do not know how he did it. I could not work out the secret when I saw the performance, and afterwards, no matter what principles of magic I applied, I could not think of the solution.\n\nI had only two minor compensations.\n\nThe first was that no matter how brilliant his effect, my own secret was still intact from Angier. He did not carry out the illusion my way.\n\nThe second was that of speed. No matter what his secret, Angier's performance effect was still not as quick as mine. My body is made to transport from one cabinet to the other in an instant. There is no delay of any kind. Angier's effect was measurably slower. On the evening I witnessed the illusion I estimated one or at most two seconds had passed, which meant to me that he was one or at most two seconds slower than me.\n\nTwo weeks after the incident, by arrangement with the front-of-house manager, I went round to the Hackney Empire on the pretext of wishing to take measurements in advance of one of my own performances. My request was treated as a normal one, and the manager's assistant greeted me and assisted me with my researches.\n\nI found the seat where I had been, and established that it was just over fifty feet from the stage. I stood beside the seat I had been using, and tried to triangulate Angie's position by recalling the angle at which I had turned my head to see him. In the end, the best I could do was to place him somewhere in a long stretch of the stepped aisle.\n\nI stood for a while in the centre of the stage, approximately in the place where the tripod's apex had been, and stared along the central aisle, wondering how I myself would arrange to get from one position to the other, in a crowded auditorium, in darkness, in under five seconds. I didn't know.\n\nI decided to attend Angier's next season of performances, visiting his show every night if necessary, until I had solved the mystery. Tommy Elbourne would be with me. I would cling to my pride so long as I could, and if I were able to take his secret from him, without arousing his suspicions, then that would be the ideal result. But if, by the end of the season, we had not come to a workable theory we would abandon all the rivalry and jealousies of the past, and I would approach him direct, pleading with him if necessary for an insight into the explanation. Such was the maddening effect on me of his mystery.\n\nNone of this happened, however. After an extended Christmas, break Angier departed for a tour of the USA at the end of January.\n\nA week after his return in April (announced in The Times) I called at his house, determined to make my peace with him, but he was not there. The house, a large but modest building was closed. I spoke to neighbours, but I was repeatedly told that they knew nothing of the people who lived there. Angier obviously kept his life as secure from the outside world as I did.\n\nI contacted Hesketh Unwin, his booking agent, but was rebuffed. I left a message with Unwin, pleading with Angier to contact me urgently. Although the agent promised the message would reach Angier in person, it was never answered.\n\nI wrote to Angier directly, personally, proposing an end to all the rivalry, all bitterness, offering any apology or amends he would care to name in the cause of conciliation between us.\n\nHe did not answer, and at last, I felt I had been taken to a point that was beyond reason.\n\nMy response to his silence, I fear, was insensible.\n\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\n\nDuring the third week of May, I caught a train from London to the seaside town and fishing port of Lowestoft, in Suffolk. Here, Angier was booked for a week of performances. I went with only one intent, and that was to penetrate backstage and discover the secret for myself.\n\nAngier was playing at the Pavilion, a substantial and well- equipped theatre on the seafront, one in which I myself had performed in the past.\n\nI went to the box office and bought myself a stalls seat.\n\nMy seat was in the front row of the stalls. Angier looked briefly at me soon after he walked on the stage, but I had disguised myself expertly and was confident he had not recognized me.\n\nWhen Angier began his playing-card routine and called for volunteers, I stood up with a show of hesitation, and sure enough was invited on to the stage. As soon as I was close to Angier I realized how nervous he was, and he barely looked at me as we went through the amusing process of choosing and concealing cards. I played all this honestly, because wrecking his show was not what I wished to do.\n\nWhen the routine was complete, his female assistant came swiftly up behind me, took my arm in a polite but firm grip, and led me towards the wings. Under the noise of the applause, I said to her, \"It's all right, my dear. I can find my seat\".\n\nShe smiled gratefully, patted me on the arm, then turned away towards Angier. He was pulling forward his props table while the applause died. Neither of them was looking at me. Most of the audience was watching Angier.\n\nI stepped back, and slipped into the wings. Immediately, a stagehand stepped out to block my way.\n\n\"Sorry, sir,\" he said loudly. \"You aren't allowed back stage\".\n\nAngier was just a few feet away from us, starting his next routine. If I argued with the man, Angier would hear us and realize something was up. With a flash of inspiration, I pulled off the hat and wig I had been wearing.\n\n\"It's part of the act, you damned fool\"! I said quietly. \"Out of the way\"!\n\nThe stagehand looked confused and stepped back. I walked past him and went along a short corridor until I reached the steps leading down to the sub-stage area.\n\nThe mezzanine is one of the main technical areas of the theatre. I found the area deserted.\n\nTowards the back of the mezzanine floor, I found what I was seeking. I saw two large and strongly built crates clearly stamped: Private - The Great Danton. Next to them was a huge voltage converter of a type unfamiliar to me. My own act used such a device for powering the electrical bench, but it was small. It was giving off noticeable heat as I approached it, and a low, powerful humming noise was issuing from somewhere deep within.\n\nI leaned over the converter, trying to understand how it works. Overhead, I could hear Angier's footsteps on the stage, and the sound of his voice. I could imagine him striding to and fro, as he made his speech about the wonders of science.\n\nSuddenly, the converter made a loud knocking noise, and to my alarm, a thin but toxic blue smoke began emerging with some intensity from a grille in its upper panel. The humming noise intensified. At first, I leapt back, but a growing sense of alarm made me go forward again.\n\nI could hear Angier's steps continuing a few feet above my head, clearly unaware of what was happening down here.\n\nAgain, the knocking noise sounded within the device, this time accompanied by a most sinister screeching noise. The smoke was pouring out more quickly than before and when I moved round to the other side of the object I discovered that several thick metal coils were glowing red hot.\n\nAll around me was the mess of a mezzanine floor. There were tons of dry timber, miles of ropes, heaps of discarded paper, huge scenery panels painted with oils. The whole place was a tinderbox, and in the centre of it was something that was going to explode into flames. I stood there in terrible indecision - could Angier or his assistants know what was happening down here?\n\nThe converter made more noises, the smoke was getting into my lungs, and I was beginning to choke. In desperation, I looked around for some kind of fire extinguisher.\n\nThen I saw that the converter was taking its power from a thick cable that ran from a large electrical junction box attached to the rear wall. I dashed over to it. There was an Emergency On/Off handle built into it, and without another thought, I pulled it down.\n\nThe infernal activity of the converter instantly died. The blue smoke was thinning quickly.\n\nOverhead there was a heavy thud, followed by silence.\n\nA second or two passed, while I stared apologetically up at the stage floor above me.\n\nI heard footsteps dashing around, and Angier's voice shouting angrily. I could hear the audience too, a more indistinct noise, neither cheering nor applauding. The racket of hurrying feet and raised voices from up there was increasing. Whatever I had done had caused chaos.\n\nI had come to this theatre to solve a mystery, not to interrupt the show, but I had failed in the former and accidentally succeeded in the latter.\n\nI realized that I would be discovered if I remained where I was, so I stepped away from the rapidly cooling converter and returned the way I had come. My lungs were starting to ache from the smoke I had inhaled, and my head was spinning. Overhead, on the stage and in the general backstage area, I could hear many people moving quickly and noisily around. Somewhere in the building, not too faraway, I heard someone screaming. I should be able to slip away in the confusion.\n\nAs I ran up the steps, I saw an amazing sight!\n\nAngier himself was standing at the top of the steps, waiting for me, with his arms raised in anger. But it seemed to me he had assumed the form of a ghost! I saw lights beyond him. Immediately, several thoughts flashed through me - this must be a special garment he wears to help him do that trick! Some fabric that becomes transparent! Makes him invisible! Is this his secret?\n\nBut in the same instant I ran into him, and we both fell on the floor. He tried to grab me, but whatever he had smeared on himself prevented him from getting a good grip on me. I was able to release myself and slide away from him.\n\n\"Borden\"! His voice was hoarse with anger, no more than a terrible whisper. \"Stop\"!\n\n\"It was an accident\"! I shouted. \"Keep away from me\"!\n\nI ran from him, leaving him lying there on the hard floor. I sprinted down a short corridor, rounded a corner, ran down a short flight of steps, went along another bare corridor, then came across the doorkeeper's booth. He looked up in surprise as I dashed past, but he had no hope of stopping me.\n\nMoments later, I was outside the stage door, and hurrying along the dimly lit alley to the seafront.\n\nHere I paused for a moment, facing out to sea, leaning forward and resting my hands on my knees. I coughed a few times, painfully, trying to clear the remains of the smoke from my lungs. It was a fine dry evening in early summer. The sun had just set, and the coloured lights were coming on along the promenade. The tide was high and the waves were breaking softly against the sea wall.\n\nThe audience was walking out of the Pavilion Theatre, and dispersing into the town. Many of the people wore puzzled expressions, presumably because of the sudden way the show had ended. I walked along the promenade with the crowd, then I headed towards the railway station.\n\nMuch later, long after midnight, I was back in my London house. My children were asleep in their rooms, Sarah was warm beside me, and I lay there in the darkness wondering what the night had achieved.\n\nThen, seven weeks later, Rupert Angier died.\n\nTo say I was consumed by feelings of guilt would be an understatement, especially as both of the newspapers, which recorded his passing referred to the \"injuries\" he had suffered while performing his illusion. They did not say that the accident had happened on the date I was in Lowestoft, but I knew that must be the one.\n\nI had already established that Angier cancelled the remainder of his season at the Pavilion, and as far as I knew, he had not performed elsewhere in public afterwards. I had no idea why.\n\nNow it became obvious that he was fatally injured that night. What was inexplicable to me was that I had run into Angier less than a minute after my accidental intervention. He did not seem fatally injured then, or even hurt to a minor extent. The only unusual thing about him had been the greasy substance he had smeared on himself or his costume, presumably to perform the illusion or to help in some way with making himself vanish. That was a genuine puzzle, because after I had recovered from the effects of the smoke inhalation, my memory of those few seconds was exact. For a moment, I had \"seen through\" him, as if parts of him were transparent.\n\nAnother minor aspect of the mystery was that none of the substance had rubbed off on me during our fight. His hands had definitely gripped my wrists, and I had distinctly felt the slimy sensation, but no trace was left.\n\nI felt guilty, though, and, confronted with the awfulness of the event, I felt I could not rest until I had been able to make some kind of amends.\n\nUnfortunately, the newspaper obituaries had not been published until several days after Angier had died, when the funeral had already been held. This event would have been an ideal place for me to start the process of late reconciliation with his family and associates. A simple note of condolence would have helped me, but it was not to be.\n\nAfter much thought I decided to approach his widow directly, and wrote her a sincere and sympathetic letter.\n\nIn it I explained who I was, and how I, when much younger, had, to my eternal regret, fallen out with her husband. I said that the news of his premature death had shocked and saddened me and that I knew the whole magical community would feel the loss. I paid tribute to his skills as a performer, and as an ingenieur of marvellous illusions.\n\nI then moved on to what was for me the aim of the letter. I said that when a magician died it was customary in the world of magic for his colleagues to offer to purchase whatever pieces of apparatus there were for which the family might no longer have a use. I added that in view of my long and troubled relationship with Rupert during his lifetime I saw it as a duty and a pleasure to make such an offer now that he had died, and that I had considerable means at my disposal.\n\nTwo weeks after I wrote to Angier's widow, I received a reply, in the form of a letter from a firm of solicitors. It said:\n\nMy Dear Sir,\n\nPursuant to your recent enquiry to our client, I am instructed to advise you that all necessary arrangements for the disposal of the late Rupert David Angier's possessions have been made, and that you need not embark on further enquiries as to their destination or enjoyment'.\n\nIn this we remain, Sir, your obedient servants,\n\nKendal, Kendal and Owen\n\n(Solicitors and Commissioners for Oaths).\n\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\n\nIt is 1st September 1903, and I say that my own career ended with Angier's death. Although I was reasonably wealthy, I was a married man with children and had an expensive and complicated way of life to sustain. I could not walk away from my responsibilities, and so I was obliged to accept bookings so long as they were offered to me. In this way I did not fully retire, but the ambition that had driven me in the early years, the wish to amaze, the sheer delight of dreaming up the impossible, all these left me. I still had the technical ability to perform magic, my hands remained dexterous, and with Angier absent, I was once again the only performer of The New Transported Man, but none of this was enough.\n\nA great loneliness had descended on me. The Pact prevents me from describing it in full, except to say that I was the only friend I craved for myself. Yet I, of course, was the only friend I could not meet.\n\nI touch on this as delicately as I can.\n\nMy life is full of secrets and contradictions I can never explain.\n\nWhom did Sarah marry? Was it me, or was it me? I have two children, whom I adore. But are they mine to adore, really mine alone... or are they actually mine? How will I ever know, except by the cravings of instinct? With which of me did Olive fall in love, and with whom did she move into the flat in Hornsey? It was not I who first made love to her, nor was it I who invited her to the flat, yet I took advantage of her presence, knowing that I too was doing the same.\n\nWhich of me was it who tried to expose Angier? Which of me first invented The New Transported Man, and which of me was the first to be transported?\n\nI seem, even to myself, to be incoherent, but every word here is coherent and precise. It is the essential dilemma of my existence.\n\nYesterday I was playing at a theatre in Balham, in southwest London. I performed the matinee, then had two hours to wait before the evening show. As I often did at such times, I went to my dressing room, closed and locked the door, dimmed the lights and went to sleep on the couch.\n\nI awoke -\n\nDid I wake at all? Was it a vision? A dream?\n\nI awoke to find the ghostly figure of Rupert Angier standing in my dressing room, and he was holding a long- bladed knife in both hands. Before I could move or call out, he leapt at me, landing on the side of the couch and crawling quickly on top of me so that he was astride my chest and stomach. He raised the knife, and held it with the point of the blade resting above my heart.\n\n\"Prepare to die, Borden\"! he said in his horrid whisper.\n\nIn this hellish vision, it seemed to me that he barely weighed anything at all, that I could easily flip him away from me, but fear was weakening me. I brought my hands up and gripped his forearms, to try to stop him thrusting the knife fatally into me, but to my amazement, I found that he was still covered with the greasy substance that prevented my getting a strong hold on him. The harder I tried, the more quickly my fingers slipped around his disgusting flesh. I was breathing his stink, the smell of the grave.\n\nI gasped in horror, because I felt the pointed blade pressing painfully against my breast.\n\n\"Now! Tell me, Borden! Which one are you? Which one\"?\n\nI could scarcely breathe, such was my fear, such was the terror that at any second the blade would puncture my heart.\n\n\"Tell me and I spare you\"! The pressure of the knife increased.\n\n\"I don't know, Angier! I no longer know myself\"!\n\nAnd somehow that ended it, almost as soon as it had begun. His face was inches away from mine, and I saw him grimace with rage. His rotten breath flowed over me. The knife was starting to pierce my skin! I swung at him once, twice, battering him back from me. The deadly pressure on my heart softened. The knife lifted away. He was still on me, so I hit him again, then thrust up the side of my body to unseat him. To my immense relief, he released the knife and fell to the floor. The deadly blade clattered against the wall and landed on the floor, as the ghostly figure rolled across the floorboards.\n\nHe was quickly on his feet, looking weak, and watching me in case I attacked again. I sat up on the couch. He was the spirit of ultimate terror, the ghost in death of my worst enemy in life.\n\nI could see the lamp glinting through his semi-transparent body.\n\n\"Leave me alone,\" I croaked. \"You are dead! You have no business with me\"!\n\n\"Nor I with you, Borden. Killing you is no revenge. It should never have happened. Never\"!\n\nThe ghost of Rupert Angier turned away from me, walked to the locked door, then passed through it. Nothing of him remained, except a persistent trace of his hideous stench.\n\nI was sitting immobile on the couch, paralyzed with fear. A few minutes later, my dresser came to the room and tried to get in, and his insistent knocking at last roused me from the couch.\n\nI found Angier's knife on the floor of the dressing room, and I have it with me now. It is real. It was carried by a ghost.\n\nNothing makes sense. It hurts to breathe, to move; I still feel that pressing point of the knife against my heart. I am in the Hornsey flat, and I do not know what to do or who I really am.\n\nEvery word I have written here is true, and each one describes the reality of my life. My hands are empty, and I fix you with an honest look. This is how I have lived, and yet it reveals nothing.\n\nI will go alone to the end.\n\nPART THREE.\n\nKATE ANGIER.\n\nCHAPTER ONE.\n\nI was only five at the time, but there's no doubt in my mind that it all really happened.\n\nIt was cruel, unexplained and almost certainly illegal. It wrecked the lives of most of the people involved. It has shattered my own life.\n\nNow I can tell the story as I saw it take place, but tell it as an adult.\n\nMy father is Lord Colderdale, the sixteenth of that name. Our family name is Angier. My father, Victor Edmund, is the son of Rupert Angier's only son Edward. Rupert Angier, The Great Danton, was therefore my great-grandfather, and the 14th Earl of Colderdale.\n\nMy mother's name was Jennifer, though my father always called her Jenny at home. They met when my father was working for the Foreign Office, in 1946, on a train journey from Berlin to London. She was a nurse who had been working with the Occupying Powers in the German capital, and was returning to England at the end of her tour of duty.\n\nThey married in 1947, and around the same time, my father was released from his post at the Foreign Office. They came to live here in Caldlow, where my sister and I were eventually born. I don't know much about the years that passed before we came into the world, or why my parents left it so long before having children. Their marriage was never entirely smooth. I know that my mother briefly left my father during the late 1950s, because one day many years later I overheard a conversation between her and her sister, my Auntie Caroline. My sister Rosalie was born in 1962, and I followed in 1965. My father was then nearly fifty, and my mother was in her late thirties.\n\nLike most people, I can't recall much about my first years of life. When I was eight, I was sent away to a girls' boarding school, but while I was little, I spent most of my life at home with my mother. When I was four, she sent me to a nursery school in Caldlow village, and later to the primary school in Baldon, the next village along the road towards Chapel.\n\nI was taken to and from the school in my father's black Standard, driven carefully by Mr Stimpson, who with his wife represented our entire domestic staff.\n\nOne day a car arrived at the main gate and Stimpson went down to let it in. The car that drove up to the house was a Mini. The paint had lost its shine, the front bumper was bent from a collision, and there was rust around the windows. It was not at all the sort of car that we usually saw. Most of my parents' other friends were apparently well off or important.\n\nThe man who had been driving reached into the back seat of the Mini, and pulled out a little boy, just now waking up. He cradled the boy against his shoulder. Stimpson conducted them politely to the house. Rosalie and I watched as Stimpson returned to the Mini to unload the luggage they had brought with them, but we were told to come down from the nursery and meet the visitors. Everyone was in our main sitting room. Both my parents were dressed up as if it was an important occasion, but the visitors looked more casual.\n\nWe were introduced formally; my family took social manners seriously, and Rosalie and I were experienced in them. The man's name was Mr Clive Borden, and the boy, his son, was called Nicholas, or Nicky. Nicky was about two, which was three years younger than me and five years younger than my sister.\n\nFrom my own researches, I have later found out a little more about this family. I know for instance that Clive Borden's wife had died shortly after the birth of her baby. Her maiden name was Diana Ruth Ellington, and she came from Hatfield in Hertfordshire. Nicholas was her only son. Clive Borden himself was the son of Graham, the son of Alfred Borden, the magician. Clive Borden was therefore the grandson of Rupert Angier's greatest enemy, and Nicky was his great-grandson, my contemporary.\n\nObviously, Rosalie and I knew nothing of this at the time, and after a few minutes, Mama suggested that we might like to take Nicky up to our nursery and show him some of our toys. We obeyed, and Mrs Stimpson looked after us all.\n\nWhat then passed between the three adults I can only guess at, but it lasted all the afternoon. Clive Borden and his boy had arrived soon after lunchtime, and we three children played together, uninterrupted, all afternoon until it was almost dark. Mrs Stimpson supervised toilet visits, and brought us snacks and drinks.\n\nI realize that this meeting was one of the occasional attempts to patch up the row between our ancestors. What could it possibly matter now, or then, that two stage magicians were constantly at each other's throats? Hatred or envy between those two old men surely could not concern distant descendants who had their own lives and affairs. Well, so it might seem in all common sense, but passions of blood are irrational.\n\nIn the case of Clive Borden, irrationality seems part of him. His life has been difficult to research, but I know he was born in west London. He led an average childhood and had a fair talent for sports. He went to college after he left school but dropped out after the first year. In the decade afterwards, he was frequently homeless and probably stayed in the houses of a number of friends and relatives. He was arrested several times for drunk behaviour, but somehow managed to avoid a criminal record. He described himself as an actor and made a living in the film industry, doing extra and stand-in work whenever he could find it. The one short period of emotional and physical stability in his life was when he met and married Diana Ellington. They set up home together in Twickenham, Middlesex, but the marriage turned out to be tragically short-lived. After Diana died, Clive Borden stayed on in the flat they had been renting and managed to persuade a married sister, who lived in the same area, to help bring up the baby boy. He kept working in films, and although he was again drifting socially, he provided for the child. This was his general situation at the time he came to visit my parents.\n\n(After this visit, he left the flat in Twickenham, apparently moved back to the centre of London, and in the winter of 1971 went abroad. He went first to the USA, but after that travelled on to either Canada or Australia. According to his sister, he changed his name, and deliberately broke all contacts with his past. I have done what investigation I can, but I have been unable to establish even whether he is still alive or not.)\n\nBut now I return to that afternoon and evening of Clive Borden's visit to Caldlow House, and try to reconstruct what had taken place while we children played upstairs.\n\nMy father showed hospitality, offering drinks and opening a rare wine to celebrate the occasion. This is the way my father behaved in a social situation whose outcome he could not predict or control.\n\nMy mother, meanwhile, was playing a more subtle part. I believe she did not say much, at least for the first hour or so, but focused on the one subject that concerned them all. She kept trying to steer the conversation in that direction.\n\nI find it harder to talk about Clive Borden, because I hardly knew him, but he had probably suggested the meeting. I believe there was an exchange of letters, which led to the invitation. Now I know his financial situation at the time, maybe he was hoping something might come his way as a result of a reconciliation. Or perhaps at last he had traced a family memoir that might explain or excuse Alfred Borden's behaviour. (Borden's book then existed, of course, but few people outside the world of magic knew about it.) On the other hand, he might have found out about the existence of Rupert Angier's personal diary. It's almost certain he kept one, because of his obsession with dates and details, but he either hid or destroyed it before he died.\n\nI'm certain that an attempt to patch up the feud was behind the meeting, no matter who suggested it. What I saw at the time and can remember now was cordial enough, at least at first. It was after all a face-to-face meeting, which was more than their own parents' generation had ever managed.\n\nOn the day of Clive Borden's visit, we children were eventually brought down from the nursery, and taken to the dining room to eat with the grown-ups. We liked Nicky, and the three of us were pleased to be seated together along one side of the table. I remember the meal clearly, but only because Nicky was there with us. My sister and I thought he was acting up to amuse us, but I realize now that he simply did not know how to behave. His father sometimes spoke to him harshly, trying to correct him or to calm him down, but Rosalie and I were encouraging the little boy.\n\nWithout our knowing it, our noisy behaviour undoubtedly contributed to the tension between the adults. Clive Borden's raised voice became a grating sound, one I started to dislike. Both my parents were responding badly to him, and any pretence of courtesy was abandoned. They began arguing, and my father addressed him in the voice we usually heard him use in restaurants where the service was slow. By the end of the meal, my father was half-drunk, half-enraged; my mother was pale and silent, and Clive Borden (presumably also more than a little drunk) was talking endlessly about his misfortunes. Mrs Stimpson took the three of us out into the room next door, our sitting room.\n\nNicky, for some reason, began to cry. He said he wanted to go home, and when Rosalie and I tried to calm him down, he struck out at us, kicking and punching.\n\nAs for my father, we'd seen him in this sort of mood before.\n\n\"I'm frightened,\" I said to Rosalie.\n\n\"I am too,\" she said.\n\nWe listened at the double door connecting the two rooms. We heard raised voices, then long silences. My father was pacing about, clicking his shoes impatiently on the polished parquet floor.\n\nCHAPTER TWO.\n\nThere was one part of the house to which we children were never allowed to go. Access to it was by way of a brown- painted door beneath the back staircase. This door was always locked, and until the day of Clive Borden's visit I never saw anyone in the family or servants go through it.\n\nRosalie had told me there was a haunted place behind it. She told me of tragic lost souls in search of peace, of clutching hands and claws that lay in wait for our arms and legs in the darkness a few inches beyond the door. Rosalie had three years' advantage, and she knew what would scare me.\n\nI was constantly frightened as a child. The whole place is old, filled with memories of other people's lives, scarred with the remains of their deaths. It is no place for an imaginative child.\n\nIndoors, the gloomy corridors and stairwells, the hidden alcoves, the sombre ancient portraits, all gave a sense of oppressive threat. The rooms in which we lived were brightly lit and filled with modern furniture, but near them, there were ancient tragedies and silent evenings. I learned to hurry through some parts of the house, fixing my stare dead ahead so as not to be distracted by anything from this chilling past that could harm me. The downstairs corridor beside the rear stairs, where the brown-painted door was found, was one such area of the house.\n\nAll through my childhood, both before and after the day that Clive Borden came to visit, I passed the door on the far side of the corridor. I never paused to listen for movement behind it. I always hastened past, trying to ignore it out of my life.\n\nThe three of us, Rosalie, myself and the Borden boy Nicky, had been made to wait in the sitting room, next to the dining room where the adults still conducted their incomprehensible conflict. Both of these rooms led out into the corridor where the brown door was situated.\n\nVoices were raised again. Someone passed the connecting door. I heard my mother's voice and she sounded upset.\n\nThen Stimpson walked briskly across the sitting room and slipped through the connecting door into the dining room. We had a glimpse of the three adults beyond; they were still in their positions at the table, but were standing. I briefly saw my mother's face, and it seemed distorted by grief and anger. The door closed quickly before we could follow Stimpson into the room.\n\nWe heard my father speaking. That tone of voice always meant trouble would follow. Clive Borden said something, and my father replied angrily, in a sufficiently loud voice for us to hear every word.\n\n\"You will, Mr Borden\"! he said, and in his voice broke briefly into falsetto. \"Now you will\"!\n\nWe heard the dining-room door to the corridor open. Borden said something again, still indistinctly.\n\nThen Rosalie whispered against my ear, \"I think Daddy is going to open the brown door\"!\n\nI clung to Rosalie in panic. Nicky, infected with our fear, let out a wail. I too started making a howling noise so that I could not hear what the adults were doing.\n\nRosalie hissed at me, \"Hush\"!\n\n\"I don't want the door opened\"! I cried.\n\nThen, tall and sudden, Clive Borden burst into the sitting room from the corridor and found the three of us. He stepped forward, then took Nicky into his arms.\n\nI heard him mutter something to the boy, but it was not a reassuring sound. Behind him, across the corridor, beneath the stairs, I saw the open rectangle where the brown door had been. A light was on in the area behind and I could see two steps leading down, then a half-turn with more steps below.\n\nI watched Nicky as he was carried out of the room. His father was holding him high, so that he could wrap his arms around his father's neck, facing back. His father reached up and placed a protective hand on the boy's head as he ducked through the doorway and went down the steps.\n\nRosalie and I had been left alone. I was holding on to my older sister, with both of my arms wrapped around her leg. There was no sign of Mrs Stimpson.\n\n\"Are you going with them\"? Rosalie said.\n\n\"No! You go! You look and tell me what they're doing\"!\n\n\"I'm going up to the nursery,\" she said.\n\n\"Don't leave me\"! I cried. \"I don't want to be here on my own. Don't go\"!\n\n\"You can come with me\".\n\n\"No. What are they going to do to Nicky\"?\n\nBut Rosalie pushed me away from her. Her face had gone white, and her eyes were half-closed. She was shaking.\n\n\"You can do what you like\"! she said and ran out of the room. She went along the dreaded corridor, past the open doorway, then turned at the bottom of the staircase and rushed upstairs. Now, from an adult perspective, I suspect she had frightened herself more than me.\n\nA sense of calm swept over me, paralysing my imagination. It was only another form of fear, but it enabled me to move. I knew I could not stay alone where I was, and I knew I did not have the strength to follow Rosalie up those distant stairs. There remained only one place to go. I crossed the short distance to the open brown door and looked down the steps.\n\nThere were two light bulbs in the ceiling illuminating the way down, but at the bottom, where there was another doorway leading to the side, much brighter light was spilling across the steps. The staircase looked bare and ordinary, surprisingly clean, with no hint of any danger. I could hear voices rising up from below.\n\nI went down the steps quietly, not wishing to be noticed, but when I reached the bottom and looked into the main cellar, I realized there was no need to hide myself. The adults were preoccupied with what they were doing.\n\nI was old enough to understand much of what was happening. When I first reached the bottom of the steps my father and Clive Borden were arguing again, this time with Borden doing most of the talking. My mother stood to one side, as did the servant, Stimpson. Nicky was still in his father's arms.\n\nThe cellar was spacious, cool and clean. I had no idea that our part of the house had so much space beneath it.\n\nMuch of the cellar was filled with stuff brought down from the main house for storage. Along the length of one wall was a stack of framed canvases, with their painted sides facing the wall.\n\nThen my attention was gripped by the apparatus built in the centre of the cellar.\n\nMy first thought was that it was a kind of shallow cage, because it was a circle of eight wooden slats. Next, I realized that it had been built in a pit in the floor. To enter it one had to step down, so that it was in fact larger than it looked at first. My father, who had stepped into the centre of the circle, was only visible from about his waist up. There was also an arrangement of wiring overhead, and something rotating on a central axis, flashing in the cellar lights. My father was working hard, there was obviously some kind control arrangement below my line of sight, and he was bending over, pumping his arm at something.\n\nMy mother stood back, watching intently with Stimpson at her side. These two were silent.\n\nClive Borden stood close to one of the wooden bars, watching my father as he worked. His son Nicky was in his arms, and had turned around to look down too. Borden was saying something and my father, while continuing to pump, answered loudly, and with a gesticulating arm. I knew my father was in a dangerous mood, the sort Rosalie and I suffered when we had enraged him to the point where he felt he had to prove something to us, no matter how ridiculous.\n\nI realized Borden was provoking him into this kind of rage, perhaps deliberately. I stepped forward, not to any of the adults, but towards Nicky. This small boy was caught up in something he could not possibly understand, and my instinct was to rush across to him, take hold of his hand and perhaps lead him away from the dangerous adult game.\n\nI had walked half the distance to the group, entirely unnoticed by any of them, when my father shouted, \"Stand back, everyone\"!\n\nMy mother and Stimpson, who presumably knew what was going to happen, immediately moved back a few paces. Clive Borden had not moved, and stood only a foot or two away from the edge of the pit. Still no one looked at me.\n\nA series of loud bangs suddenly burst from the device, and with each, one appeared a long stem of white electrical discharge. The noise was tremendous. My father looked up towards Borden, and I could see a familiar expression of triumph on his face.\n\n\"Now you know\"! he yelled at him.\n\n\"Turn it off, Victor\"! my mother cried.\n\n\"But Mr Borden has insisted! Well, here it is, Mr Borden! Does this satisfy your insistence\"?\n\nBorden was still standing just a short distance from the snaking electrical discharge. He was holding his little boy in his arms. I could see the expression on Nicky's face, and I knew he was as scared as I was.\n\n\"This proves nothing\"! Borden shouted.\n\nMy father's response was to close a large metal handle attached to one of the pillars inside the machine. The zigzagging beams of energy immediately doubled in size. The noise was deafening.\n\n\"Get in, Borden,\" my father shouted. \"Get in and see for yourself\"!\n\nTo my amazement, my father then climbed out of the pit, stepping up to the main floor of the cellar between two of the wooden bars. Instantly, a number of the electrical rays flashed across to him. For a moment he was surrounded by them, consumed by fire. He seemed illuminated from within. Then he took another step, and he was out of it.\n\n\"Not scared, are you, Borden\"? he shouted harshly.\n\nI was close enough to see that the hair on my father's head was standing up from his scalp.\n\n\"Damn you, damn you\"! cried Borden.\n\nHe turned on my father, and thrust the horror-struck child at him. Nicky tried to hang on to his father, but Borden forced him away. My father accepted the boy reluctantly, taking him in an awkward hold. Nicky was yelling with terror, and struggling to be released.\n\n\"Jump in now\"! my father yelled at Borden. \"It will go in the next few seconds\"!\n\nBorden took a step forward until he was at the edge of the zone of electricity. My father was beside him, while Nicky was reaching out with his arms, screaming and screaming for his daddy. Waving blue snakes of discharge moved crazily a fraction of an inch in front of Borden. His hair rose from his scalp, and I could see him clenching and unclenching his fists. One of the stems found him, snaking down his neck, around his shoulders and back.\n\nHe leapt back in terror, and I felt sorry for him.\n\n\"I can't do it\"! he gasped. \"Turn the bloody thing off\"!\n\n\"This is what you wanted, isn't it\"?\n\nMy father was filled with madness. He stepped forward, away from Clive Borden, and into the deadly torrent of electricity. Half a dozen stems instantly wound themselves around him and the boy. All the hairs on his head were standing on end, making him more terrible than ever I had seen him.\n\nHe threw Nicky into the pit.\n\nMy father stepped back, away from the deadly barrage.\n\nAs Nicky fell, his arms and legs scrabbling wildly at the air, he screamed again, one despairing yell. It was a cry of sheer terror, loneliness and fear of abandonment.\n\nBefore he hit the ground, the device exploded with light. Flames leapt from the overhead wires. The wooden slats seemed to swell outwards with the pressure from within, and as the stems of light withdrew into themselves, they did so with a metal screech.\n\nHorribly, it had ended. Thick blue smoke hung heavily in the air. The device was at last silent, and doing nothing.\n\nNicky lay motionless on the hard floor beneath the structure.\n\nSomewhere in the distance, it seemed, I could hear his terrible scream echoing still.\n\nCHAPTER THREE.\n\nI walked forward. Soon I was standing at the edge, beside my mother. My hand went up, as so often before, and folded itself into her fingers. She too was staring down in horror and disbelief.\n\nNicky was dead. His face had frozen in death as he screamed, and his arms and legs were twisted. He lay on his back. His hair stood up around his petrified face.\n\nClive Borden emitted a dreadful howl of misery, anger and despair, and leapt down into the pit. He threw himself on the ground, wrapped his arms around the body of his son, tried tenderly to pull the boy's limbs back to their normal position, cradled the boy's head with a hand, pressed his face against the boy's cheek, all the while shaking with terrible sobs coming from deep within him.\n\nAnd my mother, as if realizing for the first time that I was there beside her, suddenly swept her arms around me, pressed my face into her skirt, then lifted me up. She walked quickly across the cellar, bearing me away from the scene of the disaster.\n\nI was facing back over her shoulder, and as we went quickly out to the staircase, my last sight was of my father. He was staring down into the pit, and his face bore such an expression of harsh satisfaction that more than two decades later I can still remember it only with a shudder of disgust.\n\nMy father had known what would happen, he had allowed it to happen, he had made it happen. Everything about his expression said: I've proved my point.\n\nI noticed also that Stimpson, the servant, was crouching on the floor. His head was bowed.\n\nI've lost, or suppressed, all memories of what happened after that. I only recall being at school during the following year, and then changing schools, making new friends, gradually growing up through childhood.\n\nNor can I remember when my father left us. I know the date it happened, because I found it in the diary my mother kept in the last years of her life, but my own memory of that time is lost. Because of her diary, I also know most of her feelings about the split-up, and a few of the circumstances. For my part, I remember a general sense of his presence when I was small, his unpredictable figure. I also remember life afterwards without him, a strong sense of his absence, a peace that Rosalie and I liked and which has continued ever since.\n\nI was glad at first that he went. Only when I was older I began to miss him, as I do now. I believe he must be alive still, because otherwise we would have heard. Our estate is complicated to run, and my father is still responsible for that. There is a family trust, administered by solicitors in Derby, and they are apparently in touch with him. The house and land and title are still in his name. Many of the direct charges, such as taxation, are dealt with and paid by the trust, and money is still available to Rosalie and me.\n\nOur last direct contact with him was about five years ago, when he wrote a letter from South Africa. Passing through, he said, although he didn't say where from or where to. He is in his seventies now. No matter how much time passes, I always remember him, as the cruel-faced man who threw a small boy into a machine he knew would certainly kill him.\n\nClive Borden left the house the same night. I've no idea what happened to Nicky's body, although I have always assumed that Borden took it with him.\n\nBecause I was so young, I accepted my parents' authority as final and when they told me, the police would not be interested in the boy's death, I believed them. In the event, they seemed to be right.\n\nYears later, when I was old enough to realize how wrong it was, I tried to ask my mother what had happened. This was after my father had left home, and about two years before she died.\n\nIt felt to me as if the time had come to clear up the mysteries of the past. I also saw it as a sign of my own growing up. I wanted her to be frank with me and treat me like an adult. I knew she had received a letter from my father earlier that week, and it gave me an excuse to bring up the subject.\n\n\"Why did the police never come round to ask questions\"? I said.\n\nShe said, \"We never talk about that, Katherine\".\n\n\"You mean that you never do,\" I said. \"But why did Daddy leave home\"?\n\n\"Ask him that\".\n\n\"You know I can't,\" I said. \"You're the only one who knows. He did something wrong that night, but I'm not sure why, and I'm not even sure how. Are the police looking for him\"?\n\n\"The police aren't involved in our lives\".\n\n\"Why not\"? I said. \"Didn't Daddy kill that boy? Wasn't that murder\"?\n\n\"It was all dealt with' at the time. There is nothing to hide, nothing to feel guilty about. We paid the price for what happened that night. Mr Borden suffered most, of course, but look what it has done to all our lives. I can tell you nothing you want to know. You saw for yourself what happened\".\n\n\"I can't believe that's the end of it,\" I said.\n\n\"Katherine, don't ask these questions. You were there too. You're as guilty as the rest of us\".\n\n\"I was only five years old\"! I said. \"How could that possibly make me guilty of something\"?\n\n\"If you're in any doubt you could establish that by going to the police yourself\".\n\nMy courage failed me in the face of her cold manner. Mr and Mrs Stimpson still worked for us then, and later I asked Stimpson the same questions. Politely, stiffly, tersely, he denied all knowledge of anything that might have taken place.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR.\n\nMy mother died when I was eighteen. Rosalie and I thought that news of it would make our father return, but it did not happen. We stayed on in the house, and slowly it dawned on us that the place was ours. We reacted differently. Rosalie gradually freed herself of the place, and in the end, she moved away. I began to be trapped by it, and I'm still here. A large part of what held me was the feeling of guilt I could not throw off, about what had happened down there in the cellar. Everything centred on those events, and in the end, I realized I would have to do something about cleaning myself of what happened.\n\nI finally plucked up my courage and went down to the cellar to discover if anything of what I had seen was still there.\n\nI chose to do it on a day in summer, when friends were visiting from Sheffield and the house was full of the sounds of rock music and the talk and laughter of young people. I told no one what I was planning, and simply slipped away from a conversation in the garden and walked into the house. I had drunk three glasses of wine.\n\nThe lock on the door had been changed soon after the Borden visit, and when my mother died I had it changed again. Mr Stimpson and his wife were long gone, but they and the housekeepers who came after them used the cellar for storage. I had always been too nervous even to go to the top of the steps.\n\nOn that day, though, I wasn't going to let anything stop me. I had been preparing mentally for some time. Once through the door I locked it from the inside, switched on the electric lights, and walked down to the cellar.\n\nI looked immediately for the apparatus that had killed Nicky Borden, but, unsurprisingly, it was no longer there. However, the circular pit was still in the centre of the cellar floor, and I went over and inspected that. It had clearly been excavated with a plan in mind, because several steel ties were drilled into the concrete sides at regular intervals, presumably to act as stays for the wooden bars of the apparatus. In the ceiling, overhead, directly above the centre of the pit, there was a large electrical junction box.\n\nI noticed that there were numerous scorch marks on the ceiling radiating out from the box, and although someone had put a coat of white paint over these, they still showed through clearly.\n\nApart from all this, there was no sign that the apparatus had ever been in place.\n\nI found the thing itself a few moments later, when I went to investigate the collection of crates, cases and large mysterious objects stored neatly along one wall. I soon realized that this was where my great-grandfather's magic stuff had been stored, presumably after his death. Near the front, there were two large wooden crates, each of them so heavy I was unable to move them. Drawn in black on one of them were routing names: \"Denver, Chicago, Boston, Liverpool (England)\". A Customs manifest was still stapled to the side. Holding it under the nearest light I saw that someone had written, \"Contents - Scientific Instruments\". Metal hoops had been attached on all four sides of both crates, and there were obvious handholds all over the crates.\n\nI tried to open the nearer of the two, fumbling along the edge of the lid to find some way to force it open, when the top swiveled upwards lightly. I knew at once I had found the parts of the electrical apparatus I had seen that night, but because it had been disassembled, all menace was gone.\n\nAttached to the inside of the lid were several large sheets of paper, and instructions had been written in a clear hand.\n\nI glanced over the first few:\n\n1. Locate, check, and test local ground connection. If insufficient, do not proceed. See (27) below for details of how to install, check, and test a ground connection. Always check wiring colors; see chart attached.\n\n2. If not used in USA or Great Britain. Locate, check, and test local electricity supply. Use instrument located in Wallet 4.5.1 to determine nature, voltage, and cycle of current. Refer to (15) below for settings to main transforming unit.\n\n3. Test reliability of local electricity supply while assembling the apparatus. If there is divergence of 25V, do not attempt to operate the apparatus.\n\nAnd so on, a thorough checklist of assembly instructions, using technical or scientific words and phrases. (I have arranged for a copy to be made, which I keep in the house.) The whole list was signed with the initials \"F.K.A\"..\n\nInside the lid of the second crate was a similar list of instructions, concerning dismantling the apparatus.\n\nAt this moment, I began to realise who my great-grandfather had actually been. What I mean by this is the sense of what he had done what he had been capable of, what he had achieved in his life. Until then he was just an ancestor, Grandpa who had his stuff about the house. I still knew almost nothing about him, but at last I had an insight into what he did, and a little of how he did it.\n\n(Later in the year, I sorted through the rest of his stuff and this too helped me sense what he was like. The room that had been his study was full of neatly filed papers: correspondence, bills, magazines, travel documents, theatre programmes. A large part of his life was filed away there, and there was more in the cellar, costumes and equipment from his shows. Most of the costumes had fallen to bits with old age, and I threw them out, but the cabinet illusions were in working or repairable condition, and because I needed the money, I sold the best examples to magic collectors. I also disposed of Rupert Angier's collection of magic books. I did not sell the electrical apparatus, and it is still down in the cellar in its crates.)\n\nGoing down into the cellar put my childish fears of it behind me. When I emerged from the old brown door, locking it behind me, I believed I had thrown off something unwelcome that had haunted my life until then.\n\nIt was not enough, though. Nothing could excuse the fact that I had seen a small boy cruelly murdered that night, and by my own father.\n\nThis secret indirectly influences everything I do. I rarely make friends, I want no lovers, a career does not interest me. Since Rosalie moved out to get married, I have lived here alone, as much a victim as my parents were.\n\nI want to distance myself from the madness that the feud has brought to my family in the past, but as I grow older I believe more strongly the only way out is to face up to it. I cannot get on with my life until I understand how and why Nicky Borden died.\n\nHis death tortures me. The obsession would end if I knew more about the boy, and what really happened to him that night. As I have learned about my family's past, I have learned inevitably about the Bordens. I traced you, Andrew, because I think you and I are the key to the whole thing - you are the sole surviving Borden, while I am to all intents the last living Angier.\n\nAgainst all logic, I know Nicky Borden was you, Andrew, and that somehow you survived that ordeal.\n\nCHAPTER FIVE.\n\nThe rain had turned to snow during the evening, and it was still falling as Andrew Westley and Kate Angier sat together over the remains of dinner. Her story appeared at first to produce no response from him, because he merely looked quietly at his empty coffee cup, fingering the spoon in the saucer. Then he said he needed to stretch. He crossed the room to the window to stare out at the garden. He did not change position for some time, and Kate felt that either his eyes must be closed or he was staring blankly into the dark.\n\nIn the end he said, \"I'll tell you all I know. I lost contact with my twin brother when I was about the same age as you're describing. Maybe what you've told me would explain that. But his birth wasn't registered, so I can't prove he exists. But I know he's real. You've heard how twins have a kind of bond? That's how I'm sure. The other thing I know is that he is connected in some way with this house. Ever since I arrived today, I've been sensing him here. I don't know how, and I can't explain\".\n\n\"I've looked at the records too,\" she said. \"You don't have a twin\".\n\n\"Could someone have interfered with official records? Is that possible\"?\n\n\"That's what I wonder. If the boy was killed, wouldn't that give someone enough motive to find a way of falsifying the records\"?\n\n\"Maybe so. All I can say for sure is that I don't remember anything about it. It's all blank. I don't even remember my father, Clive Borden. That child obviously couldn't have been me, and it's absurd even to think it was. It must have been someone else\".\n\n\"But it was your father... and Nicky was his only child\".\n\nHe turned from the window, and went back to his chair. It was across the wide table from hers.\n\n\"Look, there are only two or three possibilities,\" he said. \"The boy was me, and I was killed and now I'm alive again. That doesn't make any sense, whichever way you look at it. Or the boy who died was my twin brother, and the person who killed him, presumably that's your father, later managed to get official records changed. I don't believe that either, frankly. Or you were mistaken, the child survived, and it might or might not have been me. Or... I suppose you could have imagined the whole thing\".\n\n\"No. I didn't imagine it. I know what I saw. Anyway my mother admitted it\". She picked up her copy of the Borden book, and opened it at a page she had previously marked with a slip of paper. \"There's another explanation, but it's as illogical as the others. If you weren't actually killed that night, then, probably, it was some kind of trick. The thing I saw that night was apparatus built for a stage illusion\".\n\nShe turned the book around, and held it out to him, but he waved it away.\n\n\"The whole thing is ridiculous,\" he said.\n\n\"I saw it happen\".\n\n\"I think you were either mistaken in what you saw, or it happened to someone else\". He looked at his watch in a distracted way. \"Do you mind if I use my mobile? I must tell my parents I'm going to be late. And I'd like to ring my flat in London\".\n\n\"I think you should stay the night. Mrs Makin will prepare the spare room for you\".\n\nHe did not move from the chair. She laid the Borden book on the table between them, facedown at the open pages.\n\n\"What do you want from me, Kate\"? he said.\n\n\"I don't know any more. Perhaps I never did. I think this is what happened when Clive Borden came to see my father. They both felt they should try to sort something out, went through the motions of trying, but the ancient differences still mattered\".\n\n\"There's only one thing that interests me. My twin brother is somewhere here. In this house. Ever since you showed me your grandfather's stuff this afternoon, I've been aware of him. He tells me not to leave, to come, to find him. I've never known his presence as strong in me. Whatever you say, whatever the birth register shows, I think it was my brother who came here to the house in 1970, and I think he's somehow still here\".\n\n\"In spite of the fact he doesn't exist\".\n\n\"Yes, in spite of that. At the same time, we both know there's something strange about what happened that night. Or you do, at least\".\n\nShe had no answer to that. She poured herself another drop of brandy, and Andrew said, \"Is there somewhere I can make those calls\"?\n\n\"Stay in here. This is the warmest place in the house in winter. I've got something I want to check\".\n\nShe left the room, went down to the main hall and looked through the front door. There was a solid covering of snow, two or three inches. There were no sounds of traffic. She went around to the back of the house, and saw that a drift was building up against the woodshed. Mrs Makin was in the kitchen, so she spoke to her and asked her to get the spare room ready.\n\nShe and Andrew remained in the dining room after Mrs Makin had cleared away the meal, sitting on opposite sides of the open fireplace, talking about various everyday things; his trouble with the girl he lived with, hers with the local council who wanted some of her land for building purposes. But she was tired. At eleven, she suggested they should continue in the morning.\n\nShe showed him where the spare room was, and which bathroom he could use. He thanked her politely for her hospitality, said goodnight, and that was that.\n\nKate returned to the dining room, where she had left some of her great-grandfather's papers. She sat by the fire, thinking about that old incident, trying as she had done for a quarter of a century to confront what it meant.\n\nMrs Makin came in just then, and Kate asked if she would make her some decaffeinated coffee before she went to bed. She listened to the midnight news on Radio 4 as she sipped the coffee. The spare room Andrew was in was immediately overhead, and she could hear him turning frequently in the ancient bed. She knew how cold that room could be. It had been her bedroom as a child.\n\nPART FOUR.\n\nRUPERT ANGIER.\n\n21st September 1866.\n\nThe Story of My Life\n\n1: My History, my name is ROBBIE (Rupert) DAVID ANGIER and I am 9 nine years old today. I am to write in this book every day until I am old.\n\n2: My Ancestors, I have many but Papa and Mama are the first. I have one brother: HENRY RICHARD ANGUS ST JOHN ANGIER, and he is 15 he goes to school.\n\n3: I live in Caldlow House Caldlow Derbyshire. I have had something wrong with my throat this week.\n\n4: The Staff, I have a Nan and there is Grierson and a maid who changes with the other maid in the afternoons, but I don't know her name.\n\n5: I have to show this to Papa when I have written it. The end. Signed Rupert David Angier.\n\n22nd September 1866.\n\nThe Story of My Life.\n\n1: Today the doctor came to see me again and I am all right. Got a letter today from Henry my brother who says I must call him Sir from now on because he is a prefect.\n\n2: Papa has gone to London to sit in the House. He said that I am the head of the house until he gets back. This means Henry would call me Sir but he is not here.\n\n3: Told this to Henry when I wrote to him.\n\n4: Went for walk, talked to Nan, was read to by Grierson who fell asleep as usual.\n\nI do not have to show this to Papa any more, provided I keep it up.\n\n23rd September 1866.\n\nThroat much better. Went for drive today with Grierson, who did not say much but he told me that Henry says that when he takes over the house he will be going. Grierson will be going when Henry takes over the house, I mean.\n\nI am waiting for Mama to come and see me, she is late tonight.\n\n22nd December 1867.\n\nYesterday evening there was a party for me and several boys and girls from the village, it being Christmas they are allowed here. Henry was here too but he did not want to come to the party because of the others. He missed a great treat because we had a magician at the party!\n\nThis man, who was called Mr A Presto, did the most wonderful tricks I have ever seen. He started by making all sorts of banners and flags and umbrellas appear from nowhere, with lots of balloons and ribbons. Then he did some tricks with playing cards, making us choose cards, which he was able to guess. He was very clever. I pleaded and pleaded to be told how these tricks were done, but Mr Presto would not tell me.\n\nThis morning I had an idea, and I got Grierson to drive into Sheffield for me and buy all the magic tricks he could find, and to see if there were any books that told you how to do it. Grierson was gone nearly all day, but in the end he came back with most of what I wanted. It includes a special glass box for hiding a bird in so I can produce it by magic. Already I have learnt a trick where I can guess which card someone else has chosen and I have tried it out several times on Grierson.\n\n1st April 1873.\n\nHome from school. I now have sufficient privacy to write in this book.\n\nMy father, the 12th Earl of Colderdale, died three days ago, 29th March 1873. My brother Henry assumes his title, lands and property. The future of myself, my mother, and every other member of the household is now uncertain.\n\nPapa will be buried tomorrow in the vault.\n\nThis morning I am feeling more optimistic about my prospects. I have been here in my room this morning, practising my magic. I believe I have now attained performance standard, and although I have not yet put this to full test, I have often practised new tricks on the fellows at school.\n\nI wish, and this is my only wish in this saddest of weeks, that I could use my magic to bring Papa back to his life. A selfish wish, because it would undoubtedly help restore my own life to where it was three days ago, but also a fervently loving wish, because I loved my Papa and already I miss him, and regret his passing. He was forty-nine years old, and I believe that is too young by far to be a victim of failure of the heart.\n\n2nd April 1873.\n\nThe funeral has taken place, and my father has been laid to rest. After the ceremony in the chapel, his body was taken to the family vault, situated beneath the East Rise.\n\nEvening.\n\nWe were all there, assembled in the hall beneath the main staircase. Sir Geoffrey Fusel-Hunt, my father's solicitor, opened the brown envelope that contained the dread document. I looked around at the others. My father's brothers and sisters were there, with their spouses and, in some cases, their children. The men who managed the estate and who guarded the game, patrolled the moor, protected the farms and the fishery, stood in a small group to one side. In the centre of the semi-circular group, directly facing Sir Geoffrey across his desk, myself and Mama, with the servants behind us. In front of us all, standing, arms folded across his chest, central to the moment, Henry dominated the occasion.\n\nThere were no surprises. Henry inherited father's title, lands and property. Mama is given the choice, for the remainder of her life, of occupying a principal wing of the main house or total occupation of the dower house by the gate. I am allowed to remain in the rooms I presently occupy until I finish my education or gain my majority, after which my fate will be decided by Henry. The rest of the household is to stay or be disposed of as Henry sees fit.\n\nTomorrow I shall try to decide how I am to live my life, and to make this decision before Henry can make it for me.\n\n3rd April 1874.\n\nIt seems appropriate to return to this diary after the space of a year. I remain at Caldlow House, partly because until I am twenty-one I am in the charge of Henry, my legal guardian, but mainly because Mama wishes me to. Henry has taken a residence in London, from where he daily attends the House.\n\nFollowing Papa's death, I allowed my practice of legerdemain to fall into neglect, but about nine months ago I returned to it. Since then I have been practising intently, and taking every opportunity to watch the performance of stage magic. Many of the illusions are already known to me, but at least once in every performance I see something that excites or baffles me. After this, the hunt for the secret is on. Grierson and I now know the various magic dealers and suppliers, where, with persistence, we eventually gain access to what I require.\n\nGrierson, alone in our household, knows of my magical interest and ambition. When Mama speaks pessimistically of what is to become of me, I dare not tell her what I plan, but deep inside me, I feel a knot of confidence that when I leave Derbyshire I shall have a career to follow. The magic journals to which I subscribe write of the immense fees a top illusionist may now have for a single performance, not to mention the social glory that attaches to a brilliant career on the stage.\n\nI am waiting in the wings', however, because once I am of age my real life will begin!\n\n31st December 1876.\n\nIdmiston Villas, London N.\n\nI have finally been able to get my boxes and cases from storage, and I spent a dismal Christmas going through my old belongings, sorting out those that I no longer want, and those I am glad to find again. This diary was one of the latter, and I have been reading through it for the last few minutes.\n\nToo many gaps already exist. I tore out all those pages where I described my rows with Henry, and with them went the records I kept of my progress in magic.\n\nAlso I see from my last entry, more than two and a half years ago, that I was then waiting to reach the age of twenty- one, so that Henry could throw me out of the house. In fact, I did not wait that long, and took matters into my own hands.\n\nSo here I am, at the age of nineteen, living in rented lodgings in a respectable street in a London suburb, a man free of his past, and, for the next two years at least (because irrespective of where I am living Henry has to continue my allowance), free of financial worries. I have already performed my magic once in public, but was not paid for it. (The less said about that humiliating occasion the better.)\n\nI have become, and shall remain, plain Mister Rupert Angier. I have turned my back on my past. No one in this new life of mine will ever find out the truth of my birthright.\n\n1st January 1877.\n\nThe morning post has brought with it a small parcel of books from New York for which I have been waiting for many weeks, and I have been looking through them for ideas.\n\nI love to perform. I study the craft of using a stage, of presenting a show, of entertaining an audience with a stream of witty or droll remarks... and I dream of laughter, gasps of surprise, and a storm of applause. I know I can reach the top of my profession simply by the excellence of presentation.\n\nMy weakness is that I never understand the working of an illusion until it is explained to me. When I see a trick for the first time, I am as baffled by it as any other member of the audience. I have a poor magical imagination, and find it difficult to apply known general principles to produce a desired effect. When I see a superb performance, I am dazzled by the shown and puzzled by the unseen.\n\nI have spent a large amount of my monthly allowance in magic shops, where I have purchased the secret or the device that has allowed me to add one trick or another to my steadily expanding repertoire. It is devilish hard to discover secrets when they cannot be purchased for cash!\n\nI find it annoying that the older magicians protect their secrets so jealously. This afternoon I penned a letter to Prestidigitators' Panel, a monthly journal sold by subscription only, setting out my thoughts on the widespread and absurd obsession with secrecy.\n\n3rd February 1877.\n\nEvery weekday morning, from 9 00 am to midday, I patrol what has become a well-worn path between the offices of the four main theatrical agencies who specialize in magic or novelty acts and enquire politely if any commissions might be available to me.\n\nInvariably, so far, the answer has been in the negative. I know many unemployed performers follow the same daily path as me. Naturally, I see these others as I go about my applications, and naturally, I have befriended some of them. When we have lunch at one or another tavern, I am able to stand a few drinks for them. I am popular for this, of course, but I do not fool myself that it is for any other reason. I am glad of the company, and also for the more subtle hope that through any of these hail-fellows I might one day make a contact who might find or offer me some work.\n\nI have time enough to write letters. I have become a persistent and, I fancy, a controversial correspondent on the subject of magic. I make a point of writing to every issue of the magic journals I see, and try always to be provocative. I am partly motivated by the sincere belief that the world of magic is tasteless today, but also by a sense that my name will not become known unless I spread it about in a way that makes it remembered.\n\nSome letters I sign with my own name; others with the name I have chosen for my professional career: Danton. The use of two names allows me a little flexibility in what I say.\n\n16th April 1877.\n\nHenry has informed me, through his solicitors that my allowance is going to end on my twenty-first birthday. I have the continuing right to reside in Caldlow House, but only in the rooms already allocated to me.\n\nI have until September next year seventeen months in which to break this vicious circle of failure to get work, leading to failure to become known, leading to failure to build an audience for my skills, leading to failure to find work.\n\n13th June 1877.\n\nAt last, I have been offered some work!\n\nIt is not much, some card tricks to perform at a conference of businessmen in a London hotel, and the fee is only half a guinea, but this is a red-letter day!\n\nTen shillings and sixpence! More than a week's rent for these lodgings! Riches indeed!\n\n10th October 1877.\n\nI am in love! Her name is Drusilla MacAvoy.\n\n15th October 1877.\n\nThe woman was not for me. I am planning to kill myself, and if the remainder of these pages are blank, anyone who comes across this diary will know I succeeded.\n\n22nd December 1877.\n\nNow at last I have found the real woman in my life! I have never been so happy. Her name is Julia Fensell, she is but two months younger than I, her hair is a glowing reddish brown and it cascades about her face. She has blue eyes, a long straight nose, a chin with a tiny dimple, a mouth that seems always about to smile, and ankles whose slender shape drives me wild with love and passion! She is the most beautiful young woman I have ever seen, and she says she loves me as much as I love her.\n\nIt is impossible to believe. She drives from my mind all worries, all fears, all anger and despair and ambitions. She fills my life entirely.\n\n31st December 1877.\n\nThe year is ending, and tonight, at 11 00 pm, I am joining Julia so that we might be together as the new year begins.\n\nTotal Income for 1877: 5s 3p'.\n\n3rd January 1878.\n\nI have been seeing Julia every day since the middle of last month. She has become my dearest, closest friend. I must write of her as objectively as possible, for my knowing her has already changed my fortune.\n\nI first met Julia while waiting in an outer office of one of the agents in Great Portland Street. She said she was an actress; I said I was an illusionist.\n\nJulia is the first person, apart from Grierson, to whom I have shown my tricks in private. Unlike Grierson, who always applauded anything I did, Julia was critical and appreciative in equal measure.\n\nSometimes, in her turn, Julia would recite for me. It amazed me that she could remember so much, but she said there were techniques that were easily learned.\n\nSoon Julia began talking to me about presentation, a subject close to my heart. Our affair began to deepen.\n\nOver the Christmas holiday, while the rest of London celebrated, Julia and I were alone, in my rented lodgings, teaching each other the disciplines to which we each had become attached. She came to me in the mornings, stayed with me through the short hours of daylight, then soon after nightfall I would walk her back to her own lodgings in Kilburn. I spent the evenings and nights alone, thinking of her, of the excitement she was bringing me, of the matters of the stage to which she was introducing me.\n\nJulia is gradually drawing out of me the true talent I think I have always possessed.\n\n12th January 1878.\n\n\"Why should we not, between us, devise a magical act of a kind no one before us has ever performed\"?\n\nThis is what Julia said.\n\nWe are building a mentalist act! Julia has been teaching me her techniques of memory. I am learning the science of mnemonics, the use of memory aids.\n\n26th January 1878.\n\nWe are now ready! Imagine that I am seated on a stage, my eyes are blindfolded'. Volunteers from the audience have satisfied themselves that I cannot see out. Julia moves among the audience, taking items of their personal property and holding them for everyone, but myself, to see.\n\n\"What do I hold\"? she cries.\n\n\"It is a gentleman's wallet,\" I answer.\n\nThe audience gasps.\n\n\"Now I have taken -\"? says Julia.\n\n\"It is a wedding ring made of gold\".\n\n\"And it belongs to -\"?\n\n\"A lady,\" I declare.\n\n(If she said, \"Which belongs to -\"? I should reply, with equal conviction, \"A gentleman\".)\n\n\"Here I am holding\"?\n\n\"A gentleman's watch\".\n\nAnd so it goes. An exchange of pre-arranged questions and answers, presented with sufficient aplomb to an audience unready for the spectacle, will clearly imply mentalist contact between the two performers.\n\nThe principle is easy, but the learning is hard. I am still new to mnemonics, and, as in all magic, practice has to make perfect.\n\nWhile the practice goes on, we are able to avoid thinking about the most difficult part - obtaining an engagement.\n\n1st February 1878.\n\nTomorrow night we begin! We have wasted two weeks trying to obtain a firm booking from a theatre or hall, but this afternoon, Julia suggested we should take matters into our own hands.\n\nJulia and I visited a total of six taverns within a reasonable walking distance, and selected the one which seemed the most likely. The main bar there is a large, well-lit room, with a small raised platform at one end. The tables are set out with sufficient room for Julia to move between them while speaking to members of the audience.\n\nJulia has returned to her lodgings, and soon I will be asleep. We rehearse all day tomorrow.\n\n3rd February 1878.\n\nBetween us Julia and I have counted 2 pounds 4s 9p.\n\nWe did not fail! And we have learnt a dozen lessons about how to prepare, how to announce ourselves, how to claim attention.\n\nTonight we are planning to visit another tavern, where we shall try again. Already we have made changes to our act, based on Saturday night's experience.\n\n4th February 1878.\n\nOnly 15s 9p between us, but again what we lack in financial reward we have gained in experience.\n\n28th February 1878.\n\nAs the month ends, I can record that Julia and I have so far earned a total of 11 pounds 18s 3p from our mentalist act.\n\nOn the 3rd of next month, I shall be performing a legitimate magical act at Hasker's Music Hall in Ponders End; Danton is to appear seventh on the bill after a singing trio. Julia and I have temporarily retired from our mentalist act so as to rehearse me for this great occasion. It is a real job, in a real theatre, and it is what I have worked for over all these years.\n\n4th March 1878.\n\nReceived: 3 pounds 3s from Mr Hasker, who has said he would like to book me again in April. My trick with the coloured streamers was especially popular.\n\n12th July 1878.\n\nI have not written in this diary for some time. Julia and I were wed on 11th May, and now live together contentedly at my lodgings. We both feel it is time for a change, even though we have been earning money regularly. I cannot yet make a living from the stage, and in just over two months, I will receive the last of my monthly allowances.\n\nTheatrical bookings have in fact shown a recent improvement, and I have six of them between now and Christmas. I have been investing in some large-scale illusions. My workshop (this I acquired last month) is stocked with magical devices, from which I may soon put together a new and stimulating performance.\n\nThe real problem with theatrical bookings is that while they pay fairly well they provide no continuity. The reviews in the press are small and reluctant.\n\nThe idea for a new direction came to me (or I should more properly say, it came to Julia) while I was glancing through a daily newspaper. I saw a report that more evidence had emerged recently, that life, or a form of it, continued after death. Certain psychic adepts were able to make contact with newly deceased people, and communicate back from the afterworld to their grieving relatives. I read out a part of the report to Julia. She stared at me for a moment, and I could see her mind was working.\n\n\"You don't believe that, do you\"? she said at last.\n\n\"I take it seriously,\" I confirmed. \"After all, there are an increasing number of people who have made contact. You must not ignore what people say\".\n\n\"Rupert, you cannot be serious\"! she cried.\n\n\"But these seances have been investigated by scientists with the highest academic qualifications,\" I said.\n\n\"Am I hearing you properly? You, whose very profession is deception\"!\n\nAt this, I began to see the argument she was making.\n\n\"You are always saying,\" my beloved Julia, continued, \"that the easiest people to deceive are those who are the best educated. Their intelligence blinds them to the simplicity of magic secrets\"!\n\n\"So you are saying these seances are ordinary illusions\"? I said.\n\n\"What else could they be\"? she said triumphantly. \"This is a new enterprise, my dear. We must be part of it\".\n\nAnd so, we are moving into the world of spiritism.\n\n31st August 1878.\n\nWe have attended a total of four seances, and know what is involved. The trickery is generally of a low standard. Perhaps the recipients are in such a state of distress that they are receptive to almost anything.\n\nJulia and I have spent much time discussing how we might go about this, and we have decided that the best and only way is to think of our efforts as professional magic, performed to the highest standards. There are already too many charlatans doing the rounds in spiritism, and I have no wish to become one more of them.\n\nThis work is for me a way of making and perhaps accumulating a little money until I can support myself in a theatrical career.\n\nWe have already drafted and paid for our first advertisement in one of the London newspapers.\n\n9th September 1878.\n\nOur advertisement has caused fourteen enquiries! As we offered our services at two guineas a time, and the advertisement cost me 3s 6p, we are already making a profit!\n\nAll this morning I have been practising a technique known as the Jacoby Rope Tie. This is a technique in which a magician is tied to a plain wooden chair with an ordinary rope, yet which still allows an escape. With a minimum of supervision from the illusionist's assistant (Julia, in my case), any number of volunteers may tie the rope, yet still permit escape. The performer, once hidden inside a cabinet, can not only release himself enough to perform apparent miracles within the cabinet, but can afterwards return to his bonds, to be found, checked and released by the same volunteers who restrained him.\n\n20th September 1878.\n\nWe have our two guineas, the client was literally sobbing with gratitude, and contact, I modestly say, was briefly made with the dead.\n\nTomorrow, which also happens to be my twenty-first birthday, and the day in which my adult life begins in every way, we have to conduct a seance in Deptford, and we have much to prepare!\n\nOur first mistake yesterday was to be punctual. Our client and her friends were waiting for us, and as we entered the house and tried to set up our equipment, they were watching us. None of this must be allowed to happen again.\n\nWe need physical assistance. Yesterday we rented a cart to convey us to the address, but the carter was unwilling to help us carry our apparatus into the house (which meant that Julia and I had to do it alone, and some of it is heavy and most of it bulky). And we must never again depend on the domestic furniture we need for some of our effects. Today we were lucky; there was a table we could use, but we cannot chance that next time!\n\nMany of these improvements have already been arranged. I have today purchased a horse and cart! (The horse will be kept temporarily in the small yard behind my workshop until a proper stable can be rented.) And I have hired a man to drive the cart and to help us in and out with all our stuff. His name is Ernest Nugent; he is a strongly built man in his late twenties who until last year was a volunteer in Her Majesty's Army.\n\nNow we must travel to Deptford for our next! Deptford is one of the more inaccessible parts of London from here. Julia and I have agreed that in future we shall only accept commissions from people who live within reasonable distance of us, otherwise the work is altogether too hard, the day is too long, the financial rewards too small for what we have to do.\n\n2nd November 1878.\n\nJulia is with child! The baby is expected next June. With all the excitement this has caused we have cancelled a few of our appointments, and tomorrow we are departing to Southampton, so as to take the news to Julia's mother.\n\n15th November 1878.\n\nYesterday and the day before we conducted seances; no problems at either, and the clients were satisfied. I am growing concerned, however, at the possible effects of strain on Julia, and I am thinking that I must quickly find and hire a female assistant to work with me.\n\nAt the seance two days ago (the first since our return from Southampton), I belatedly discovered that one of the people I thought was a relative of the deceased was in fact a reporter from a newspaper. This man was on some kind of mission to expose me as a charlatan, but once we had realized his purpose, Nugent and I removed him quickly (but politely) from the house.\n\nSo another precaution has to be added to this work - I must be on my guard against active sceptics.\n\nFor indeed I am the sort of charlatan they seek to discredit. I am not what I say I am, but my deceptions are harmless and, I do believe, helpful at a time of personal loss. As for the money that changes hands, the amounts are modest, and so far, not a single client has complained to me of anything.\n\n20th November 1878.\n\nToday Julia and I have interviewed five young women, all hopeful to replace Julia as my assistant.\n\nNone was suitable.\n\nJulia has been feeling continually sick for two weeks, but says now that this is starting to improve. The thought of a baby son or daughter coming into our lives illumines our days.\n\n23rd November 1878.\n\nA peculiarly unpleasant incident has occurred.\n\nWe had gone to an address near the Angel, in Islington. The client was a youngish man, grieving by the death of his wife, and now having to cope with a family of three young children. This gentleman, whose name I shall render as Mr L, was the very first of our spiritist clients who had come to us on the recommendation of another. For this reason, we had approached the appointment with particular care and tact, because by now we appreciate that if we are to prosper as spiritists then it must be by a spiral of gradually rising fees, sustained by the grateful recommendation of satisfied clients.\n\nWe were just about to begin when a latecomer arrived. I was immediately suspicious of him. None of the family seemed to know him, and his arrival caused a feeling of nervousness in the room.\n\nI signalled to Julia, in our private unspoken code, that I suspected a newspaper reporter was present, and I saw by her expression that she had come to a similar conclusion. I was trying to decide what to do when I realized that I had seen the man before. He had been present at an earlier seance, and I remembered him because at the time his staring at me throughout my work had been most disturbing. Was his presence again a coincidence? If not a coincidence, which I suspected, what was his game? Presumably, he was there to make some move against me, but he had had his chance before and had not taken it. Why not?\n\nMy quick assessment was that on balance of probabilities I should go ahead with the seance, and so I did. Writing this now, I acknowledge that I made the wrong decision.\n\nWithout raising a hand against me, he almost ruined my performance. I was so nervous that I could hardly concentrate. Once the cabinet illusion was done with, my enemy sprang his trap. He left the table, shouldered poor Nugent aside, and snatched down one of the window blinds. A great deal of shouting followed, causing intense and uncontrollable grief for my client and his children. Nugent was struggling with the man, and Julia was trying to comfort Mr L's children, when disaster struck.\n\nThe man, in his madness, grabbed hold of Julia by her shoulders, dragged her back, swung her around, and pushed her to the floor! She fell heavily on the uncarpeted boards, while I, in the greatest distress, stood up from the table where I had been performing and tried to reach her. The attacker was between us.\n\nAgain, Nugent grabbed him, this time restraining from behind, clasping his arms at the back.\n\n\"What shall I do with him, sir\"? Nugent cried.\n\n\"Into the street with him\"! I yelled. \"No, wait\"!\n\nThe light from the window was falling directly on his face. Behind him, I saw the sight I then most wanted to see: dearest Julia was rising once more to her feet. She signalled quickly to me that she was not hurt, and so I turned my attention on the man.\n\n\"Who are you, sir\"? I questioned him. \"What interest is it you have in my affairs\"?\n\n\"Tell your man to release me\"! he muttered. \"Then I will depart\".\n\n\"You will depart when I decide\"! I said. I stepped closer to him, for now I recognized him. \"You are Borden, are you not? Borden\"!\n\n\"That is not correct\"!\n\n\"Alfred Borden, indeed! I have seen your work! What are you doing here\"?\n\n\"Let me go\"!\n\n\"What's your business with me, Borden\"?\n\nHe made no answer, but instead struggled violently against Nugent's hold.\n\n\"Get rid of him\"! I ordered. \"Throw him into the gutter\"! Nugent dragged the wretch out of the room, and returned alone a few moments later.\n\nBy this time, I had taken Julia into my arms and was holding her close, trying to reassure myself that she was indeed unharmed.\n\n\"If he has hurt you or the baby -\" I whispered to her.\n\n\"I am not injured,\" Julia replied. \"Who was he\"?\n\n\"Later, my dear,\" I said softly, because I was all too aware that we were still in the chaos of the ruined seance, with an angry or humiliated client, his miserable children, his four adult relatives and friends now visibly shocked.\n\nI said to them all with as much gravity and dignity as I could gather, \"You understand I cannot continue\"?\n\nThey showed their assent.\n\nThe children were led away, and Mr L and I went into private conference. He was indeed a sympathetic, intelligent man, proposing at once that we should leave all matters as they presently stood, and that we should meet again in a day or two to decide our next move. I assented gratefully, and after Nugent and I had transported our apparatus back to the cart, we set off for home.\n\nI voiced my suspicions as we drove along in the gathering twilight.\n\n\"That was Alfred Borden,\" I explained. \"I know little of him other than that he is a magician, barely distinguished in the business. Since his interruption, I have been trying to recall how I know him. I think I saw him perform on the stage. But he is hardly a major figure in our field\".\n\nI tried to understand why he had behaved like that. I could only explain his attack on me in terms of professional jealousy. What other motive could there be? We were virtual strangers to each other, and our paths had never crossed before. Yet his whole conduct was that of a man bent on a mission of revenge.\n\nSoon enough we were here in Idmiston Villas, and I made Julia go straight to bed. I sat with her until she fell asleep.\n\nI have twice broken off to see Julia, and she is sleeping peacefully.\n\n24th November 1878.\n\nThe worst day of my life.\n\n27th November 1878.\n\nJulia is home from hospital. She is sleeping now.\n\nBriefly, Julia wakened in the small hours' of the 24th. She was bleeding heavily and tormented with pain.\n\nI dressed at once, roused my neighbours, and begged Mrs Janson to leave her own bed and sit with Julia while I sought help. She agreed without complaint, allowing me to rush off into the night. I came across a cabman, apparently returning to his home at the end of a night of work, and I pleaded with him to help me. This he did. Within an hour, Julia was in St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, and the surgeons did their necessary work.\n\nOur baby was lost; I almost lost Julia too.\n\nShe remained in the public ward for the rest of the day, and for the two days following until this morning, when I was allowed at last to collect her.\n\nThere is a single name that has now unexpectedly entered my life, and it is one I shall never forget. It is Alfred Borden's.\n\n31st December 1878.\n\nTotal Income From Magic for 1878: 326 pounds 19s 3p. From this must be deducted expenses, including the hiring of Nugent, the purchase and stabling of the horse, purchase of costumes, and much apparatus.\n\n12th January 1879.\n\nMy first seance of the New Year, and the first in which I was assisted by Letitia Swinton. Letitia has much to learn about the magic profession, but I am hopeful she will improve. At the end of the seance I asked Nugent to hurry me back to Idmiston Villas, where I have been with Julia, telling her of my day.\n\nA letter was waiting for me here. Mr L has decided, in the event, that he no longer requires a seance in his home, but that in careful consideration of what happened he has decided I should be paid the full fee, as agreed. His payment was enclosed.\n\n15th January 1879.\n\nNugent, Letitia Swinton and I conducted a seance this afternoon. Letitia is a quick learner.\n\nReturning afterwards, I asked Nugent to let me off in the West End. I walked to the Empress Theatre, where as I had found out Borden worked, bought a ticket, and sat in the rear stalls.\n\nBorden's act was in the first half of the programme, and I watched intently what he did. He performed seven tricks of varying type, and, of these, three were ones whose explanation I do not know. (By tomorrow evening, I shall have them!) He is a good performer, and carried out his tricks smoothly, but for some reason he addresses the audience in an unconvincing French accent. It made me wish to insult him as a fraud!\n\nHowever, I must be patient. I wish my revenge to be sweet.\n\nOn my return, Julia was uncommunicative with me, and even after I told her what I had been doing, she remained cold towards me.\n\nO Julia! You were not like this before that day!\n\n19th January 1879.\n\nFor the last week, I have been applying myself to perfecting my magic, trying by intensive application to relaunch myself into my intended profession. To this end, I have tidied up my workshop, thrown away a lot of junk, repaired and repainted several of the illusions, and generally made the workshop into a business-like place where I might prepare and rehearse properly.\n\nI have started discreet enquiries for an ingenieur to work with me. I need expert assistance; of this, there is no question.\n\nI have set myself a practice schedule, to which I adhere absolutely: two hours every morning, two hours every afternoon, one hour (if time with Julia permits) in every evening. The only breaks I allow myself are when I am actually working.\n\nI have ordered myself and Letitia new costumes, to give the act professional polish.\n\nFinally, I have promised myself to quit the seances as soon as I can afford to do so. Meanwhile, I am taking on as many of them for which the time can be found, because they are my only secure means of making a living. My financial responsibilities are immense. I have the lodgings to pay for, rent to find of the workshop and stable, wages to pay for Nugent and Letitia, and soon for my new ingenieur too as well as running the household and feeding Julia and myself.\n\n31st December 1879.\n\nTotal Income from Magic for 1879: 637 pounds 12s 6p. Before expenses.\n\n31st December 1880.\n\nTotal Income from Magic for 1880: 1,142 pounds 7s 9p. Before expenses.\n\n31st December 1881.\n\nTotal Income from Magic for 1881: 4,777 pounds 10s. Before expenses.\n\n1881 is the last year in which I shall record my earnings here. This twelvemonth has been sufficiently successful for me to purchase the house in which before we have merely rented our lodgings. Now we occupy the whole building, and we have a domestic staff of three. I may record that I am probably the most popular stage illusionist in Britain. My bookings diary for next year is already full.\n\n2nd February 1891.\n\nTen years ago, I put aside my diary, intending never to reopen it, but the humiliating events earlier this evening at the Sefton Theatre of Varieties in Liverpool cannot go unrecorded.\n\nI was in the second part of my act, heading towards what is currently the climax of my performance. This is the Underwater Escape, an effect which combines physical strength, a certain amount of controlled risk, and a little magic.\n\nThe illusion begins with my being tied to a metal chair. To effect this, I invite on to the stage a committee of six volunteers; these are all genuine members of the audience, none planted, but Ernest Nugent and my ingenieur Harry Cutter keep an eye on things.\n\nWith the committee on stage I engage them in joking talk, partly to relax them, partly to misdirect the audience while Ellen Tremayne (my present assistant; it is a long time since I wrote in here) begins the Jacoby Rope Tie.\n\nTonight, though, I had just taken my seat in the chair when I realized that Alfred Borden was one of the committee! He was the Sixth Man! (Harry Cutter and I use codes to identify and place the on-stage volunteers. The Sixth Man is positioned furthest from me during these preparatory stages, and is given the task of holding one end of the rope.) Tonight Borden was the Sixth Man, only a few feet away from me! The audience was watching us all! The trick had already begun!\n\nBorden played his part well, moving clumsily and with well-faked embarrassment about his small part of the stage. Cutter, apparently not realizing who he was, propelled Borden into his place. Ellen Tremayne was meanwhile roping my hands together, and tying my wrists to the arms of the chair. It is here that my preparations went wrong, because my attention was on Borden.\n\nAmid a roll of drums, I was lifted into the air above the glass tank, and I rotated on the end of the chain as if a helpless victim of torture. In truth tonight, I was, but during a normal performance, I would by this stage have freed my wrists, and moved my hands to a position from which I could release them instantly. (My rotating on the chain is an effective cover for the necessarily quick arm movements as I release myself.) Tonight, with my arms tied immovably to the chair, I could only stare down in horror at the cold, waiting water.\n\nMoments later, according to plan, I was plunged into it. As the water closed over my head I tried by facial expressions to signal to Cutter, but he was already engaged in lowering the concealing curtain around the tank.\n\nIn semi-darkness, half inverted in the chair, tied hand and foot, I began to drown -\n\nYet here I am writing this. Obviously, I escaped.\n\nHere is a reconstruction of what must have happened on the remainder of the stage, hidden from me by the curtain.\n\nIn a normal performance, all that can be seen on the stage is the committee of six standing self-consciously around the curtain that encloses the tank. The orchestra plays lively music, partly to fill the time, partly to mask any noises I cannot suppress while making my escape. But time goes by, and soon both the committee and the audience start to feel disquiet at how much time has passed.\n\nThe orchestra too becomes distracted, and the music stops. Harry Cutter and Ellen Tremayne run anxiously on to the stage, as if in response to the emergency, and the audience makes a noise of concern. With the help of the committee, Cutter and Ellen snatch away the concealing curtain, to reveal.\n\nThe chair is still in the water! The ropes are still tied around it! But I am not there!\n\nWhile the audience gasps in amazement, I dramatically appear. It is usually from the wings, but if I have time, I prefer to announce myself in the middle of the auditorium. I run to centre-stage, take my bow, and make sure that everyone notices that my clothes and hair are perfectly dry -\n\nTonight Borden was there to ruin it all, and, unintentionally perhaps, to save me from a watery end. Long before the illusion was due to finish, thankfully long before, and while the orchestra yet played, he left the position on the stage where Cutter had placed him, strode across to the curtains and snatched them aside!\n\nMy first awareness of this was that a shaft of bright light burst upon me. I looked up in vast and sudden hope, as the last air from my lungs bubbled up around my eyes! I felt then my prayers had been answered, that Cutter had interrupted the performance to save my life. Nothing else mattered in that second of bursting hope. What I saw, through the horrid distortions of swirling water and strengthened glass, was the scornful face of my deadliest enemy! He leaned forward, pressing his face triumphantly against the tank.\n\nI felt unconsciousness rising in me, believed myself to be on the point of death.\n\nThen there is a gap. My next awareness was that I was lying on a hard wooden floor, in semi-darkness, freezing cold, with faces staring down at me. Music was playing, deafening me as the water drained in gulps from my ear passages. I could feel the floor moving up and down rhythmically. I was in the wings. When I raised my head, I saw, unfocused and wandering in my sight, the brightly lit stage just a few feet away from me, where the chorus was treading the boards, while the coryphee marched to the tune from the orchestra pit. I groaned with relief, closed my eyes, and allowed my head to fall back to the floor. Cutter had dragged me to safety, somehow restored my breathing, brought the humiliating spectacle to an end.\n\nNot long after I was carried to the green room, where my recovery properly began. It was still reasonably early in the evening, and I believed that I had plenty of time to return to the stage and attempt my illusion again, before the show ended. I was not allowed to do this. Instead, I was accompanied to the station where I took a train to London to see my family.\n\nBy an irony, my failure to keep this diary has been caused by the domestic contentment. For most of the past decade, I have been not only successful in my career but unprecedentedly happy at home.\n\nAt the beginning of 1884, Julia found herself with child again, and in due course safely delivered our son Edward. Two years later came the first of my daughters, Lydia, and last year our baby Florence was born.\n\nAgainst this background, the feud with Borden has not been important. True, we have played pranks on each other over the years. Until tonight, though, Borden and I have not directly threatened each other's lives.\n\nOnce, years ago, Borden was directly responsible for the miscarriage of my first child. Although my instinct then was one of revenge, as the months went by my anger slowly died, and I satisfied myself instead with embarrassing him at just the moment he least enjoyed it.\n\nIn his turn, he has had a few moments of unexpected revenge on me.\n\nWhat happened tonight has forced our feud to a new level. He tried to kill me; it is as plain as that. He is a magician; he knows how ropes must be tied to ensure a rapid and safe release.\n\nNow I want revenge again. I hope and pray that time will quickly pass, soothe my feelings, bring sense and sanity and calmness to me, that I do not act as tonight I feel!\n\n4th February 1892.\n\nLast night I saw an extraordinary thing. There is a scientist called Nikola Tesla visiting London, and the extravagant claims he makes were last week the talk of the town.\n\nSo, yesterday I and several hundred others gathered at the doors of the Institution of Electrical Engineers to see the great man in action.\n\nWhat I witnessed was a thrilling, alarming and mostly incomprehensible display of the powers of electricity. Mr Tesla is an associate of the inventor Thomas Edison. To modern-minded Londoners the use of electrical power for lighting is becoming a commonplace, but Tesla was able to show that it has many other uses.\n\nI watched his sensational experiments uncritically, dazzled and impressed. Many of his effects are astonishing, and many more are deeply mysterious. When Tesla spoke, it was in the tones of an evangelist. He is indeed a prophet of what the next century will hold for us. A worldwide net of electrical generating stations, power given over to the humble as well as the mighty, instantaneous transmission of energies and matter from one part of the world to the other!\n\nHis show bore an odd resemblance to any good illusionist's; the audience did not need to understand the means to enjoy the effects. In short, Mr Tesla described many scientific theories. While few in that audience understood more than the most basic concepts, every one of us was afforded a fascinating glimpse into the future.\n\nI have written off to the address Tesla supplied, and requested copies of his explanatory notes.\n\n14th April 1892.\n\nI have been busy preparing for my European Tour, which starts in the latter half of this summer, and have had little time for anything else. To complete the above entry from February, though, I eventually received Mr Tesla's explanatory notes, but could not make head nor tail of them.\n\n15th September 1892.\n\nIn Paris.\n\nThey have hailed me in Vienna, Rome, Paris, Istanbul, Marseilles, Madrid, Monte Carlo... yet now that all this is behind me I crave only to see my beloved Julia once more, and Edward and Lydia, and of course my little Florence.\n\nIt would be unwise to record the extent of my earnings until all expenses have been calculated, and the agreed bonuses paid to my assistants, but I may safely say that for the first time in my life I feel I am a wealthy man.\n\n21st September 1892.\n\nIn London.\n\nWhen I was looking through correspondence, I saw a short note from Dominic Brawton, one of my scouts:\n\nPerformer: Alfred Borden (Le Professeur de la Magie).\n\nIllusion: The New Transported Man.\n\nEffect: brilliant, not to be missed.\n\nAdaptability: difficult, but as Borden manages it somehow, so I imagine could you.\n\nI showed this to Julia.\n\nLater I showed her another letter. I have been invited to take my magic show to the New World! If I agree, we would begin touring in February with a weeklong residency in Chicago! And then a tour to the dozen or so largest American cities!\n\nThe thought of it simultaneously thrills and exhausts me.\n\nJulia said to me, \"Forget Borden. You must take your show to the USA\".\n\nAnd I too think I must.\n\n14th October 1892.\n\nI have seen Borden's new illusion, and it is good. It is devilishly good.\n\nHe begins by wheeling on to the stage a wooden cabinet, of the sort familiar to all magicians. This is tall enough to contain a man or a woman, has three solid walls, and a door at the front that opens wide enough to reveal the whole of the interior. It is mounted on castors, and these raise the entire thing high enough to show that no escape or entry would be possible through the base, without being noticed by the audience.\n\nBorden closes the cabinet door, then moves the apparatus up to stage left.\n\nStanding at the footlights he then delivers, in his wonderfully unconvincing French accent, a short lecture on the great dangers involved in what he is about to do.\n\nBehind him, a remarkably pretty young woman wheels on to the stage a second cabinet, identical to the first. She opens the door, so that the audience can see that it too is empty. With a swirl of his black cape, Borden then turns and steps briskly into the cabinet.\n\nThe drummer starts a roll.\n\nWhat happens next takes place in an instant. As the drum rolls louder, Borden removes his top hat, steps back into the cabinet, then tosses his hat high into the air. His assistant slams closed the door of the cabinet. In the same instant, the door of the first cabin we saw bursts open and Borden is now impossibly there! The cabinet he entered only moments before collapses, and folds emptily on to the floor of the stage. Borden looks up, catches his top hat, puts it on his head, then beaming and smiling steps forward to the footlights to take his bow!\n\nThe applause was loud, and I admit I joined it myself.\n\nI am damned if I know how he did that!\n\n13th November 1892.\n\nI took Cutter with me to see Borden perform his two- cabinets illusion. It happened at the Lewisham World Theatre.\n\nAs Borden produced the first of his two cabinets, I felt a thrill of anticipation. Cutter, beside me, raised his opera glasses. He was not watching the magician at all. With quick movements of the glasses, he was inspecting the rest of the stage area.\n\nI continued to watch Borden. As far as I could tell, the trick was conducted exactly as I had observed it before.\n\nFinally, beaming, bowing, he took his well-deserved applause. Cutter and I joined in.\n\nIn the taxicab running back to north London, I demanded of Cutter, \"Well, what do you think of that\"!\n\n\"Brilliant, Mr Angier\"! he stated. \"Quite brilliant! It is not often that one has the chance to see a completely new illusion\".\n\n\"Do you know how he did it\"? I insisted.\n\n\"Yes, sir, I do,\" he replied. \"And so I fancy do you\".\n\n\"I'm as baffled as ever I was. How the devil could he be in two places at once? I cannot see that it is possible\"!\n\n\"Sometimes you do surprise me, Mr Angier,\" Cutter said. \"It is a logical puzzle, solved only by the application of our own logic. What did we see before us\"?\n\n\"A man who transported himself instantly from one part of the stage to the other\".\n\n\"That is what we thought we saw, what we were intended to see. What was the reality\"?\n\n\"You still maintain he uses a double\"? I asked him. \"How else could it be effected\"?\n\n\"But you saw it as I did. That was no double! We saw him clearly before and after. He was the same man! The very same! \"Cutter winked at me, then turned away.\n\n\"Well? What do you say\"? I asked him.\n\n\"I say what I have said, Mr Angier\".\n\n\"I pay you to explain the unexplainable, Cutter. Do not trifle with me about this! It is a matter of high professional importance\"!\n\nAt this, he realized the seriousness of my mood.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said steadily. \"You must know of identical twins. There is your answer\"!\n\n\"No\"! I exclaimed.\n\n\"How else might it be done\"?\n\n\"But the first cabinet was empty-\"\n\n\"So it did appear,\" said Cutter.\n\n\"And the second cabinet collapsed the moment he left it-\"\n\n\"Very effectively too, I thought\".\n\nI knew what he was saying; these were standard stage effects for making apparatus that is concealing someone seem empty. Several of my own illusions are based on similar deceptions. My difficulty was the same I have always suffered; when I see another's illusion from the auditorium, I am as easily misdirected as anyone else. But identical twins! I had not thought of that!\n\nNow I have written down this account of the evening, I think I have to agree with him. The mystery is solved.\n\nDamn Borden! Not one man but two!\n\n30th November 1892.\n\nYesterday I obtained some remarkable facts about Borden.\n\nA young reporter from the Evening Star came to interview me. His name was Mr Arthur Koenig and he turned out to be an informant as well as an interviewer!\n\nDuring the course of a question-and-answer session, he asked me if I had any opinions I would wish to record about my magical contemporaries. I told him of the best of my colleagues.\n\n\"You have not mentioned Le Professeur,\" said my interlocutor, when I eventually paused. \"Do you not hold an opinion on his work\"?\n\n\"I regret I have not been present at any of his performances,\" I said.\n\n\"Then you must go to see his work\"! ejaculated Mr Koenig. \"His is the best show in London\"!\n\n\"Indeed\".\n\n\"I have seen his act several times,\" the reporter went on. \"There is one trick he does-\"\n\n\"I have heard of it,\" I said, interrupting him. \"Something to do with two cabinets\".\n\n\"That's the one, Mr Danton! He vanishes and reappears in a moment! No one knows how he does it\".\n\n\"No one, that is, except his fellow magicians,\" I corrected him. \"He is using standard magical procedures\".\n\n\"Then you know how it is done\"?\n\n\"Of course I know,\" I said. \"But naturally you will not expect me to reveal the exact method -\"\n\nHere I confess I was torn. Here was my chance to reveal the secret. I felt the lust for revenge that I normally suppressed. But sense prevailed once more. No magician gives away the secret of another.\n\nAt length I said, \"There are ways and means. An illusion is not what it seems. A great deal of practice and rehearsal-\" The youthful reporter practically leapt out of his seat. \"Sir, you believe he uses a twin double! Every magician in London thinks the same! I thought so too when I saw it the first time\".\n\n\"Yes, that is his method\". I was relieved to discover how straightforward he was.\n\n\"Then, sir\"! cried the young man. \"You are wrong like all the others, sir! There is no double. This is what is so amazing\"!\n\n\"He has a twin brother,\" I said. \"There is no other way\".\n\n\"It is not true. Alfred Borden has neither twin brother nor a double who can pass for him. I have personally investigated his life, and I know the truth. He works alone but for the female assistant seen on the stage with him, and a technical manager who builds his apparatus with him. In this, he is no different from any other in your profession. You too-\"\n\n\"I do have an ingenieur,\" I confirmed readily. \"But tell me more. You interest me greatly. You are certain of this information\"?\n\n\"I am\".\n\n\"Car you prove it to me\"?\n\n\"As you know, sir,\" Mr Koenig replied, \"it is not possible to prove that which does not exist. All I can say is that for the last few weeks I have been bringing journalistic methods to the investigation, and have not found a single jot of evidence to confirm what you assume\".\n\nAt this point, he produced a thin sheaf of papers and showed them to me. They contained certain information about Mr Borden that I found instantly intriguing, and I begged the reporter to let me have them.\n\nKoenig agreed to let me take handwritten extracts from several of his notes, and these I scribbled down on the spot at his dictation. At the end, I passed him five sovereigns.\n\nAs I finished, Mr Koenig said to me, \"May I ask what you are hoping to learn from this, sir\"?\n\n\"I seek only to improve my own magical art,\" I answered.\n\n\"I understand\". He stood up to leave. \"And when you have so improved, do you suppose you too will be able to perform Le Professeur's illusion\"?\n\n\"I assure you, Mr Koenig,\" I said with cold disdain, as I showed him to the door. \"I assure you that I could make his trick this very night\"!\n\nThen he was gone.\n\nToday I have not been working, and so I have written up this account of the meeting. It is imperative that I learn the secret of Borden's illusion. I can think of no sweeter revenge than to outshine him with his own trick, outperform him, outdo him in every way.\n\nFirst, though, I must check the facts I possess about Mr Borden.\n\n9th December 1892.\n\nI have in fact so far done nothing about Borden. The American tour has been confirmed as definite, and Cutter and I are preparing for it. I am going to travel for more than two whole months, and to be separated from Julia and the children for such a length of time is almost unthinkable.\n\nHowever, I cannot miss the tour. The New World is the source and location of some of the finest magicians currently in performance, and it is a magnificent compliment to be invited to undertake this tour.\n\nAnd Borden has not so far visited the USA!\n\n17th January 1893.\n\nThe last week has been a nightmare of packing and preparations, and arranging for the apparatus I need with me to be dismantled, crated, then despatched ahead of me. Nothing can be left to chance, for without my equipment I have no stage show. A lot depends on this transatlantic adventure!\n\nBut now I have a day or two of leisure in which to prepare myself mentally and relax at home for a while. The children are asleep, Julia is reading in her sitting room, and in the calm of this dark January evening, quietly in my study, I may at last record, thanks to the industrious Mr Koenig, the fruits of my enquiries about Mr Alfred Borden.\n\nThe following are facts I have personally verified.\n\nHe was born on 8th May 1856, in the Royal Sussex Hospital in Bohemia Road, Hastings. Three days after his birth, he and his mother, Betsy Mary Borden, returned to their house at 105 Manor Road, where the father worked as a carpenter. The child's full name was Frederick Andrew Borden, and according to the official records, his was a single birth. Frederick Andrew Borden was not one of two identical twins at birth, so therefore neither can he be one today.\n\nNext, I looked into the possibility of Frederick Borden having brothers of a close age to him, and bearing a strong family resemblance. Frederick was the sixth-born child. He had three older sisters and two older brothers, but of these one brother was eight years his senior, and the other had died at the age of two weeks.\n\nThere was a younger brother too. This was Albert Joseph Borden, seventh-born into the family, on 18th May 1858. (Albert + Frederick = Alfred?)\n\nAgain, the existence of a brother whose age was reasonably close to Frederick's raised the possibility of a double. I dug out and examined Albert's birth records at the hospital, but I found it difficult to ascertain much more about him. However, I decided to visit a photogenic portrait artiste called Charles Simpkins, who has his studio in Hastings High Street.\n\nMr Simpkins showed me a selection of his daguerreotypes. Amongst these, was a studio portrait of Frederick Borden and his younger brother. It had been taken in 1874, when Frederick was eighteen and his brother was sixteen.\n\nThe two are clearly unalike in appearance. Frederick is tall, he has noble features, and his bearing is arrogant, while Albert is much less attractive. He has a slack-jawed expression; his features are puffy, and his cheeks are round; his hair is wavier than his brother's and apparently paler in colour; and from his position I would say he was at least four or five inches shorter than his brother.\n\nThis portrait convinced me that Koenig was right: Frederick Borden does not have a close relation he can use as a double.\n\nIt remains possible that he has scoured the streets of London to find a man sufficiently like him to pass as a double, with the aid of stage make-up, but no matter what Cutter says I have myself seen Borden's performance. Most illusionists' doubles are only briefly glimpsed, or they misdirect the perceptions of the audience by wearing identical costumes, so that in the few seconds in which the double is visible he seems to be the original.\n\nBorden, after the transformation, allows himself to be seen, and to be seen clearly. He steps forward to the footlights, he bows, he smiles, he takes the hand of his female assistant, he bows again, he walks to and fro. There is no question but that the man who emerges from the second cabinet is the man who entered the first.\n\nI still do not know how Borden works that damnable illusion, but I do at least know that he works it alone.\n\nI am going to what is fast becoming the centre of the world of magic, and for two months I shall be meeting, and perhaps working with, some of the finest illusionists in the United States of America. There will be many there who can work out how it is done. I go to America to build my reputation, and to earn a lot of money, but I now have an extra quest.\n\nI swear that when I return in two months I shall have Borden's secret with me. I also swear that within a month of returning I shall be performing a superior version of the same trick on the London stage.\n\n13th September 1893.\n\nI am not surprised to discover that nearly eight months have elapsed since last I came to this diary to record my life.\n\nJulia and the children are gone. Cutter is gone. Much of my wealth is gone. My career has gone, through apathy.\n\nI have lost everything.\n\nBut I have gained Olivia Svenson.\n\nI have left Julia so that I might be with Olivia, after I met and fell in love with her during my American tour earlier this year. I met Olivia at a reception given in my honour in the fine city of Boston, Massachusetts, where she approached me and made her admiration known, in the way many women have approached me in the past. Olivia, then working as a danseuse, joined my party. When I left Boston she remained with us, and then we travelled together. More than this, within a week or two she was working on stage with me as my assistant, and has returned with me to London.\n\nCutter did not care for this, and we parted immediately on our return.\n\nAs, inevitably, did Julia and I. Sometimes, even now, I lie awake at night to marvel at the madness of my sacrifice. Once Julia meant the very world to me, and indeed, she helped build the world I inhabit today. My children, my three helpless and innocent children, are nothing less than victims of the same sacrifice. All I can say is that my madness is the madness of love; Olivia blinds me to every other feeling that is not passion for her.\n\nSo I cannot bring myself to write down, even in the privacy of this journal, what was said, done and suffered at that time. Much of the saying and doing was mine, while all the suffering was Julia's.\n\nI now support Julia in a household of her own, where to maintain appearances she lives the life of a widow. She has the children with her, she has her material needs taken care of, and she does not have to see me again if she does not want to. Indeed, if I were seen at her house the appearances would be betrayed, so I have become a dead man. I can never meet my children in their own house again, and have to make do with the occasional excursion with them.\n\nJulia and I meet briefly on such occasions, and her sweetness of nature tortures me. But there is no going back. I have made my bed and now I lie in it. When I manage to close my mind to the family I have lost, I am a happy man. I expect no favourable judgement of myself. I know I have wronged my wife.\n\nI have always tried never to hurt the people around me. Even in my dealings with Borden I have shrunk from causing him pain or danger, preferring to take revenge by irritating or embarrassing him. But now I find I have caused the greatest hurt of all, to the four people who meant the most to me. At the risk of humbug, I can only swear that I shall never do anything like this again.\n\n14th September 1893.\n\nMy career struggles towards a new version of stability.\n\nI feel at last I can emerge from the hole of misery and lethargy into which I declined, and I am ready to return to the stage. I have instructed Unwin to find me bookings, and my career may resume.\n\nTo celebrate the decision, Olivia and I went this afternoon to the premises of a theatrical costumier, where she chose, and was measured for, her new stage outfit.\n\n1st December 1893.\n\nIn my appointments book I have a thirty-minute Christmas show that I am to perform for a school of orphans. Other than that, my book is empty. Since the end of September, I have earned only 18 pounds 18s.\n\nHesketh Unwin speaks of a whispering campaign against me. He warns me to neglect it, because the success of my tour of America is well known and it is easy to cause jealousy.\n\nI am disturbed by this news. Is Borden behind it?\n\nI occupy my days with practice and rehearsal. Although my skill with prestidigitation increases, sometimes, in my darker moments, I do wonder why I am continuing to rehearse at all.\n\nAt least the orphans will see a marvellous entertainment!\n\n14th December 1893.\n\nBookings have been made for January and February. Our spirits have risen.\n\n20th December 1893.\n\nMore bookings for January, one of them, I do declare, left vacant by a certain Professeur de la Magie! I am happy to take his guineas.\n\n23rd December 1893.\n\nA Happy Christmas! Unwin has sent me the contract for my appearance on 19th January at the Princess Royal Theatre in Streatham. This is the booking left free by Borden. I was glancing through the contract when my gaze fell on one of the clauses toward the end. It read that my performance should be to the same general standard of excellence as the act that was being replaced.\n\nI think I could at last perform Borden's illusion.\n\nI am so taken with the idea that I have been dashing around London all day, trying to find someone who will act as my double. This is the wrong time of year to be looking; all the unemployed actors are working in the numerous pantomimes and Christmas shows around the town.\n\nI have just over three weeks in which to prepare. Tomorrow I shall start to build the cabinets!\n\n4th January 1894.\n\nAt last, I have my man! His name is Gerald William Root, an actor... and regular drunkard and brawler. Mr Root is however desperate for cash, and I have drawn from him a promise that so long as he works for me he shall only taste liquor after each performance. The cash that I am able to offer him is so generous, by his usual standards, that I believe I can purchase his reliability.\n\nHe is the same height as me, and his general stance and figure are roughly mine. He is a little stouter than I am, but either he will lose those extra folds of flesh, or I shall wear padding. It is of no concern. Although his eyes are an impure blue, while mine are the colour generally described as hazel, the difference is not noticeable, and again we can use theatrical make-up to misdirect attention.\n\nNone of the details matters. More potentially serious is the problem of his gait, which is noticeably looser than mine, with longer strides, and his feet turn slightly outwards as he walks. Olivia has taken charge of the problem, and believes she can coach him in time. As any actor knows, you convey more about a character with a walk or a bearing than any number of facial characteristics, accents or gestures. If my double walks differently from me while on the stage he will not be mistaken for me. It is as simple as that.\n\nRoot says that he understands the problem. Provided that on the night he is mistaken for me, he will have earned his money.\n\nA fortnight remains in which to rehearse.\n\n18th January 1894.\n\nI am nervous about tomorrow's performance, even though Root and I have rehearsed it until we are sick of it. In perfection lies a risk; if tomorrow I perform Borden's illusion, and improve on it, and I shall, word that I have done so will reach him within days.\n\nI know there is yet a terrible truth that I have not faced up to. It is that Borden will instantly know the means by which I have brought off the illusion, but I still do not know his.\n\n20th January 1894.\n\nIt was a triumph! Today, the Morning Post describes me as \"probably Britain's greatest living illusionist\".\n\nIt is sweet. But it also has a sour side I had not anticipated! At the conclusion of the illusion, it is the drunkard Root who takes the ovation, who holds Olivia's hand in his, who bows and waves and blows kisses -\n\nAnd I can only wait for the darkness of the stage when the curtain descends, before I make my escape.\n\nThis will have to change. We must arrange it that I am the one who emerges from the unexpected cabinet, so the switch with Root must be made before the illusion begins. I shall have to think of a way.\n\n21st January 1894.\n\nYesterday's notice in the Post has made its impact, and already today, my agent has taken three bookings for my act.\n\nI have rewarded Root with a small cash bonus.\n\n30th June 1895.\n\nAlready the events of two years ago seem like a fading nightmare. I return to this journal merely to record that I am once again on an even keel. Olivia and I co-exist harmoniously.\n\nI intend another discussion with Root, since the last one had little effect. In spite of the excellence of his performance he is a trouble to me, and another reason for returning to this diary is to record the fact that he and I will have to talk seriously.\n\n7th July 1895.\n\nThere is a cardinal rule in the world of magic that you do not antagonize your assistants. This is because they know many of your secrets, and they therefore have a particular power over you.\n\nIf I fire Root, I shall be at his mercy.\n\nThe problem he presents is partly his alcoholic addiction, and partly his arrogance.\n\nHe has often been drunk during my performance, a fact he does not deny. He claims he can handle it. The trouble is that there is no controlling the behaviour of a heavy drinker, and I am terrified that one evening he will be too drunk to take part.\n\nHis arrogance is a worse problem. He is convinced that I am unable to function effectively without him, and whenever he is around me, I have to suffer a constant stream of advice based on his years of experience as an actor.\n\nLast night we had a \"discussion\". He said the words I most feared to hear, that he could expose my secrets and ruin my career.\n\nAnd worse. He has somehow found out about my relationship with Sheila Macpherson. I am being blackmailed, of course. I need him, and he knows it. He has power over me, and I know it.\n\nI was forced even to offer him a raise in his performance fees, and this, of course, he promptly accepted.\n\n24th August 1895.\n\nI learnt today that Borden is taking his magical show on a tour of Europe and the Levant, and that he will be out of England until the end of the year. Curiously, he will not be performing his own version of the two-cabinet illusion.\n\nHesketh Unwin informed me of this when I saw him earlier today.\n\n25th August 1895.\n\nI finally realized that with Borden out of the country, I have no need to keep performing the switch illusion, and so without delay I have given Root the sack!\n\nBy the time, Borden returns from his tour abroad, either I shall have replaced Mr Root or I shall no longer be performing the illusion at all.\n\n14th November 1895.\n\nNext week, when I open for a short season at the Royal County Theatre in Reading, my assistant will be a young lady I have been training for the last two weeks. Her name is Gertrude, she is blessed with a supple and beautiful body. She is the fiancee of my other new employee, a carpenter and apparatus technician named Adam Wilson. I am paying them both well, and am satisfied with their contributions so far to my act.\n\nAdam, I must record, is an almost exact double for me in terms of physique, and I shall keep him in mind as Root's replacement.\n\n12th February 1896.\n\nI have tonight learned the meaning of the phrase one's blood runs cold.\n\nI was engaged in one of my customary tricks with playing cards in the first half of my show. In this, I ask a member of the audience to select a card and then to write his name upon it in full view of the audience. When this is done, I take the card from him and tear it up before his eyes, tossing aside the pieces. Moments later, I show a live canary in a metal cage. When my volunteer takes the cage from me it mysteriously collapses in his hand (the bird vanishes from sight), and leaves him holding the remains of the cage in which can be seen a single playing card. When he removes it, he discovers that it is the very one on which his name is inscribed. The trick ends, and the volunteer returns to his seat.\n\nTonight, at the conclusion of the trick, as I beamed towards the audience in anticipation of the applause, I heard the fellow say, \"Here, this isn't my card\"!\n\nI turned towards him. The fool was standing there with the remains of the cage in one hand, and the playing card in the other. He was trying to read it.\n\n\"Let me take it, sir\"! I boomed theatrically, preparing to cover the mistake with a sudden production of a multitude of coloured streamers, which I keep on hand for such a case.\n\nI tried to snatch the card from him, but he swung away from me, shouting in a triumphant voice, \"Look, it's got something else written on it\"!\n\nFinally, I snatched the card out of his hand, showered him with coloured streamers, signalled the bandmaster, and waved the audience to applaud.\n\nIn the swelling music, I stood paralysed, reading the words that had been written there.\n\nThey said, \"I know the address you go to with Sheila Macpherson - Abracadabra! - Alfred Borden\".\n\nThe card was the one I had forced on the volunteer for the trick.\n\nI simply do not know how I managed to get through the rest of the performance, but somehow I did so.\n\n18th February 1896.\n\nLast night I travelled alone to the Empire Theatre in Cambridge where Borden was performing. As he went through the conventional illusion with a cabinet, I stood up in my seat in the auditorium and denounced him. As loudly as I could I informed the audience that an assistant was already concealed inside the cabinet. I immediately left the theatre.\n\nThen, unexpectedly, I found I had to pay a price for what I had done. Conscience struck me as I took my long, cold and solitary train journey back to London. I bitterly regretted what I had done. The ease with which I destroyed his magic appalled me. Magic is illusion, a temporary suspension of reality for the benefit and amusement of an audience. What right had T (or he, when he took his turn) to destroy that illusion?\n\nOnce, long ago, after Julia lost our first baby, Borden wrote to me and apologized for what he had done. Foolishly, I rejected him. Now the time has come when I anxiously desire to cease the feud between us. How much longer do two grown men have to keep sniping at each other in public, to settle some score that no one but they even know about?\n\nAll through that cold journey back to Liverpool Street Station, I wondered how it might be achieved. Now, twenty- four hours later, I still think about it. I shall brace myself, write to him, call an end to it, and suggest a private meeting to beat out any remaining scores that he feels have to be settled.\n\n20th February 1896.\n\nToday, after she had opened her letters, Olivia came to me and said, \"You're still seeing Sheila Macpherson, right\"?\n\nLater, she showed me the note she had received. It was from Borden!\n\n27th February 1896.\n\nI have made peace with myself, with Olivia, even with Borden!\n\nLet me simply record that I have promised Olivia I shall never see Miss Macpherson again (nor shall I), and that my love for her is undying.\n\nAnd I have decided that never again, shall I conduct a feud with Alfred Borden, no matter how provoked I feel. I still expect a public revenge from him for my outburst in Cambridge, but I shall ignore him.\n\n5th March 1896.\n\nSooner even than I had expected, Borden tried successfully to humiliate me while I was performing a well-known but popular illusion called Trilby. (It is the one where the assistant lies on a board balanced between two chair backs, then is seen to float apparently unaided in the air when the chairs are removed.) Borden had somehow secreted himself backstage.\n\nAs I removed the second chair from beneath Gertrude's board, the concealing backdrop lifted quickly to reveal Adam Wilson crouched behind, operating the mechanism.\n\nI brought down the main curtains, and discontinued my act.\n\nI shall not take revenge.\n\n31st March 1896.\n\nAnother Borden incident. So soon after the last!\n\n17th May 1896.\n\nAnother Borden incident.\n\nThis one puzzles me, for I had already established he was also performing this same evening, but somehow he got across London to the Great Western Hotel to sabotage my performance.\n\nAgain, I shall not take revenge.\n\n13th May 1897.\n\nAfter many long hours of work and rehearsal, Adam and I have developed our cabinet switching routine to a standard, which I know cannot be bettered. Adam, after eighteen months working closely with me, can imitate my movements and mannerisms with accuracy. He is my double to the last detail.\n\nYet each time we perform it, our audiences declare themselves, by their unenthusiastic applause, to be unimpressed.\n\nI do not know what I have to do to better the illusion.\n\n1st June 1897.\n\nI have been hearing rumours for some time that Borden has \"improved\" his switch illusion, but without further information, I have taken no notice. It is years since I saw him performing it, and so yesterday evening I and Adam Wilson went to a theatre in Nottingham, where Borden has been in residence for the last week.\n\nI disguised myself with greyed hair, cheek pads, untidy clothes, a pair of unnecessary eyeglasses, and took a seat only two rows from the front. I was just a few feet away from Borden as he performed all his tricks.\n\nEverything is suddenly explained! Borden has substantially advanced his version of the illusion. He no longer conceals himself inside cabinets. There is no more stuff-and-nonsense with some object tossed across the stage (which I have been continuing to work with until this week). And he does not use a double.\n\nI say with certainty: Borden does not use a double. I know everything there is to know about doubles. I can spot one as easily as I can spot a cloud in the sky. I am as sure as I can be that Borden works alone.\n\nThe audience saw an array of jars fuming with chemicals, cabinets decorated with coiling cables, glass tubes, and above all a host of gleaming electrical wires. It was a glimpse into the laboratory of a scientific fiend.\n\nBorden strolled around the equipment, lecturing the audience on the perils of working with electrical power. At certain moments, he touched one wire against another, or to a flask of gas, and there came an alarming flash of light, or a loud bang. Sparks flew around him, and a mist of blue smoke began to float about his head.\n\nWhen he was ready to perform, he indicated that a roll of drums be played from the orchestra pit. He seized two heavy wires, brought them dramatically together and made an electrical connection.\n\nIn the brilliant flash that followed, the switch took place. Before our very eyes, Borden vanished from where he was standing, and he instantly reappeared on the other side of the stage - at least twenty feet away from where he had been!\n\nBorden stepped forward in wild applause to take his bow.\n\nThe applause continued for long afterwards, and I report that my hands were clapping as loudly as anyone's.\n\nWhy should this fellow-magician, so gifted, so endowed with skill and professionalism, pursue a vicious feud against me?\n\n5th March 1898.\n\nI have been working hard, with little time for the diary. Today I have no bookings, so I may make a brief entry.\n\nAdam and I have not included our switch illusion in my act since that night in Nottingham.\n\nBorden has interrupted my acts twice. One of the attacks I was able to joke away, but the other was for a few minutes a disaster.\n\nI have as a result abandoned my facade of silent contempt.\n\nI am left with two ambitions. The first is to achieve some kind of reconciliation with Julia and the children. I know I have lost her forever, but the distance she puts between us is terrible to endure. The second is minor in comparison. Now that my unilateral truce with Borden has ended, I wish to discover the secret of his illusion so that I might again outperform him.\n\n31st July 1898.\n\nOlivia has proposed an idea!\n\nBefore describing it, I should say that in recent months the passion between Olivia and myself has noticeably cooled. We continue to cohabit peacefully, and at times we have behaved as man and wife, but overall we no longer act as if we love or care for each other. Yet we cling together.\n\nToday after dinner, Olivia left me, taking with her a bottle of gin. I have grown used to her solitary drinking, and no longer remark on it.\n\nA few minutes later, though, her maid, Lucy, came up and asked me if I would step downstairs for a few minutes.\n\nI found Olivia seated at her card table, with two or three bottles and two glasses standing on it, and an empty chair opposite her. She waved me to sit down, and then poured me a drink.\n\n\"Robbie,\" she said with her familiar directness. \"I'm going to leave you\".\n\nI mumbled something in reply. I have been expecting some such development for months, although I had no idea how I would cope with it.\n\n\"I'm going to leave you,\" she said again, \"and then I'm going to come back. Do you want to know why\"?\n\nI said that I did.\n\n\"Because there's something you want more than you want me. I figure that if I get out there and find it for you, then I have a chance to make you want me all over again\".\n\nI assured her I wanted her as much as ever I had, but she cut me short.\n\n\"I know what's going on,\" she declared. \"You and this Alfred Borden are like two lovers who can't get along together. Am I right\"?\n\nI tried to prevaricate, but when I saw the determination in her eyes, I quickly agreed.\n\n\"Look at this\"! she said, and showed this week's copy of The Stage. \"See here\". She folded the paper in half and passed it across to me. She had circled one of the classified advertisements on the front page.\n\n\"That's your friend Borden,\" she said. \"See what he says\"?\n\nAn attractive young female stage assistant is required for full-time employment. She must be strong and fit, and willing to travel and to work long hours, both on and off stage. Pleasing appearance is essential, and so is a willingness to participate in exciting and demanding routines before large audiences. Please apply, with suitable references, too.\n\nThe address of Alfred Borden's rehearsal room followed.\n\n\"He's been advertising for an assistant for a couple of weeks. I guess I could help him out\".\n\n\"You mean you-\"\n\n\"You always said I was the best assistant you ever had\".\n\n\"But you -? Going to work for him\"? I shook my head sadly. \"How could you do this to me, Olivia\"?\n\n\"You want to find out how he does that trick, don't you\"? she said.\n\nI sat silently before her, staring at her. If she could gain his confidence, work with him in rehearsal and on stage, move freely in his workshop, it would not be long before Borden's secret was mine.\n\nWe soon got down to details.\n\nThe need to supply references seemed for a time to be a problem, because Olivia had worked for no one but me, but she pointed out that I was entirely capable of forging letters.\n\nTwo hours or more went quickly by while we discussed her idea, and began to lay our plans. We emptied the bottle of gin, while Olivia kept saying, \"I'll get the secret for you, Robbie. That's what you want me to do, isn't it\"? And I said yes, but that I did not want to lose her.\n\nI was torn between the euphoria of making a definitive strike against him, and the prospect of him taking some even greater revenge if he realized Olivia was mine. I voiced these fears. She replied, \"I'll come back to you Robbie, and I'll bring you Borden's secret-\" We were soon drunk, playful and affectionate.\n\nI must go to forge one or two testimonials for her. We are using the address of her maid for poste restante; she is taking her mother's maiden name.\n\n14th August 1898.\n\nBorden has replied (at least, an assistant called T. Elbourne replied on his behalf), suggesting an interview early next week.\n\nI am suddenly against it, having in the last few days found a renewal of happiness with Olivia, and more unwilling than ever to see her fall into Borden's clutches.\n\nOlivia still wants to go through with it.\n\n18th August 1898.\n\nOlivia has been to the interview and returned from it, and she says the job is hers.\n\nWhile she was gone, I was in a torment of fears and regrets.\n\nOlivia was gone far longer than either of us had expected, and I was seriously wondering what I should do when suddenly she arrived back. She was elated and excited.\n\nYes, the job is hers. Yes, Borden read the references I had written, and he accepted them as genuine. No, there was no apparent suspicion of me.\n\nShe told me about some of the apparatus she had seen in his workshop, but it was all disappointingly ordinary.\n\n\"Did he say anything at all about the switch illusion\"? I queried her.\n\n\"Not a word. But he told me there were several tricks he did alone, and for which he did not need a stage assistant\".\n\nLater, saying she was tired, she went to sleep.\n\n27th August 1898.\n\nThe end of another week, and still Olivia has no information for me. She seems unwilling to talk to me about it.\n\nTonight she gave me a free pass to Borden's next series of performances. Olivia will be on stage with him.\n\n3rd September 1898.\n\nOlivia has not returned home at all this evening. I am mystified, alarmed, and full of fears.\n\n4th September 1898.\n\nI sent a boy to Borden's workshop with a message for her, but he returned to say the place was bolted up with no one apparently inside.\n\n12th September 1898.\n\nWith no further sign of Olivia returning home, I took the pass she had given me and went to the box office of the Leicester Square Theatre. Here I claimed a ticket for Borden's show. I deliberately selected a seat near the rear of the stalls, so that my presence might not be noticed from the stage.\n\nI saw Olivia. Her appearance quickened my pulse.\n\nBorden climaxed his show with the electrical switch illusion, performing it with a flair that plunged me further into depression. When Olivia returned to the stage to take the final bow with him, my gloom was complete. She looked beautiful, happy and excited, and it seemed to my troubled gaze that as Borden held her hand for the applause he did so with unnecessary affection.\n\nDetermined to see the thing through, I raced from the auditorium and hurried around to the Stage Door. Although I waited while the other artistes left, and until the doorman had locked the door and turned off the lights, I saw neither Borden nor Olivia departing the building.\n\n18th September 1898.\n\nToday Olivia's maid brought me a letter she had received from her mistress.\n\nI read it anxiously, clinging to the hope that it might contain a clue as to what had happened, but it merely said:\n\nLucy,\n\nWould you kindly make up packages and cases of all my belongings, and have them delivered as soon as possible to the Stage Door of the Strand Theatre.\n\nPlease be sure that everything is clearly labelled as being for myself, and I will arrange collection.\n\nI enclose an amount to cover the costs, and that which is left over you must keep for yourself if you require a reference for your next employment, Mr Angler will of course write it for you.\n\nThank you,\n\nOlivia Svenson\n\nI had to read this letter aloud to the poor girl, and to explain what she had to do with the five-pound note Olivia had enclosed.\n\n4th December 1898.\n\nI am currently engaged for a season of shows at the Plaza Theatre in Richmond, by the side of the River Thames. This evening, I was relaxing in my dressing room between first and second performances, when someone knocked on the door.\n\nIt was Olivia. I let her into the room. She looked beautiful but tired, and told me she had been trying to locate me all day.\n\n\"Robbie, I have gotten you the information you want,\" she said, and she held up a sealed envelope for me to see. \"I brought you this, even though you must understand that I'm not going to come back to you. You have to promise me that your feud with Alfred will end immediately. If you do, I'll let you have the envelope\".\n\nI told her that as far as I was concerned the feud was already at an end.\n\n\"Then why do you still need his secret\"?\n\n\"You surely know why,\" I said.\n\n\"Only to continue the feud\"!\n\nI knew she was touching the truth, but I said, \"I'm curious\".\n\nShe was in a hurry to depart, saying that already Borden would be suspicious of her long absence.\n\nFinally, she handed over the envelope.\n\nHolding it, I said, \"Is it really the end of the mystery for me\"?\n\n\"I believe it is, yes\".\n\nShe turned to go and opened the door.\n\n\"Can I ask you something else, Olivia\"?\n\n\"What is it\"?\n\n\"Is Borden one man, or two\"?\n\nShe smiled, and maddeningly I glimpsed the smile of a woman thinking of her lover. \"He is just one man, I do assure you\".\n\nI followed her out into the corridor.\n\n\"Are you happy now\"? I asked her.\n\n\"Yes, I am. I'm sorry if I've hurt you, Robbie\".\n\nShe left me then, without an embrace or even a smile or a touch of hands. It was painful.\n\nI returned to the dressing room, closed the door and slit the envelope at once. It contained one sheet of paper, and there was a single word.\n\nTesla.\n\n10th July 1900.\n\nColorado Springs, Colorado\n\nI have found a modest but attractive hotel, suitable for my needs, and because I liked my room on sight, I have registered for a week's stay with an option to extend it if necessary.\n\nFrom the window of my room, I can see two of the three features of Colorado Springs that have brought me here.\n\nThe whole town dances with electric lights after the sun has set; the streets have tall lamps, every house has brightly illuminated windows.\n\nThe famous mountain stands beside the town: Pike's Peak, nearly 15,000 feet in height.\n\nTomorrow, I shall make my first ascent of the lower slopes of Pike's Peak, and seek out the third remarkable feature that has brought me to this town.\n\n12th July 1900.\n\nI was too weary to write in my diary yesterday evening, but today I am alone here in the town, so I have plenty of opportunity to describe what happened.\n\nI was awake at an early hour, took my breakfast in the hotel, and walked quickly to the central square of the town where my carriage was supposed to be waiting for me. This was something I had arranged by letter before leaving London.\n\nIn the casual American manner, my man and I quickly became great friends. His name is Randall D. Gilpin, a Colorado man born and bred. I call him Randy, and he calls me Robbie. He is short and round, with a great circling of grey whiskers about his cheerful face. His eyes are blue, and his hair, like the whiskers, is steel-grey. He wears a hat made of leather. He carries a rifle under the seat from which he drives the horses, and he told me he keeps it loaded.\n\nThe route to Nikola Tesla's laboratory is a steady climb across the eastern face of the great mountain.\n\nAfter an hour and a half, we came to a plateau, on the northeast face of the mountain, and here no trees grew at all. In the centre of this small plateau, was Tesla's laboratory.\n\n\"You got business here, Robbie\"? said Randy. \"You watch how you go. It can get dangerous up here, from what folks say\".\n\n\"I know the risks,\" I said. Randy told me that he had business of his own to attend to, but would return to the laboratory in the afternoon and wait for me until I appeared.\n\nI noticed that he would not take the carriage too close to the building, and I had to walk the last four or five hundred yards by myself.\n\nThe laboratory was a square construction with sloping roofs, built with unpainted wood. In the centre of the building, rising vertically was a tall metal pole at the top of which was a large metal sphere. This was glinting in the bright morning sunshine and waving gently to and fro in the fresh breeze that was blowing along the mountainside.\n\nOn each side of the path, a number of technical instruments of obscure purpose had been set on the ground. There were many metal poles driven into the stony soil, and most of these were connected to each other with insulated wires. Close by the side of the main building was a wooden frame with a glass wall, inside which I saw several measuring dials or registers.\n\nI heard a sudden and violent crackling sound, and from within the building there came a series of brilliant and horrific flashes: white, blue-white, pink-white, repeated rapidly.\n\nI confess that at this moment my resolve briefly failed. My faint heart became even fainter when, within two or three more steps, I came upon a hand-painted sign mounted on the wall beside the main door. It said:\n\nGREAT DANGER\n\nKeep Out!\n\nAs I read this the electric discharges from within died away. I banged my fist on the door.\n\nAfter a wait of a few moments, Nikola Tesla himself opened the door. His expression was the abstracted one of a busy man who has been irritatingly interrupted. It was not a good start, but I made the best of it.\n\n\"Mr Tesla\"? I said. \"My name is Rupert Angier. I wonder if you recall our correspondence? I have been writing to you from England\".\n\n\"I know nobody in England\"! He was staring behind me, as if wondering how many more Englishmen I had brought with me. \"Say your name again, good sir\"?\n\n\"My name is Rupert Angier. I was present at your demonstration in London, and was greatly interested -\"\n\n\"You are the magician! The one Mr Alley knows all about\"?\n\n\"I am the magician,\" I confirmed, although the meaning of his second question was not clear to me.\n\n\"You may enter\"!\n\nSo many impressions about him at once. I noticed his face first. It was thin, intelligent and handsome, with strong Slavic cheekbones. He wore a thin moustache, and his hair was parted in the middle. He looked like a man who worked long hours and slept only when there was no alternative to exhaustion.\n\nTesla is equipped with an extraordinary mind. Once I had made my identity clear to him he remembered not only what we had corresponded briefly about, but that I had written to him earlier, some eight years ago, asking for a copy of his notes.\n\nInside the laboratory, he introduced me to his assistant, Mr Alley. This interesting man appears to fulfil many roles in Tesla's life, from scientific assistant and collaborator, to domestic servant and companion. Mr Alley declared himself to be an admirer of my work! He had been in the audience during my show in Kansas City in 1893, and spoke briefly but knowledgeably about magic.\n\nBy all appearances, the two men work in the laboratory alone.\n\nTesla seemed relaxed in my company. He interrogated me about the use of electricity in Britain, how widespread it was becoming. Eventually, the focus of his questions turned to myself, my career, my interest in electricity, and to what uses I might wish to put it.\n\nI let him direct our conversation, and for an hour or two, he told me about his conflicts with Edison, his struggles against bureaucracy and the scientific establishment, and most of all his successes. His present laboratory had been funded by the work of the last few years. He had installed the first water-powered city-sized electricity generator in the world; the generating station was at Niagara Falls, and the beneficiary city was Buffalo, it is true to say that Tesla had made his fortune at Niagara, but like many men of sudden wealth he wondered how long he could make last what he had.\n\nAs gently as I could I kept the conversation centred on money, because this is one of the few subjects where our interests genuinely meet. Nothing was discussed between us that touched directly on the reason for my visit here, but there will be plenty of time for that in the days ahead. Yesterday, we were just getting to know one another, and learning of each other's interests.\n\nI have said little of the dominant feature of his laboratory. During the long conversation, we were overshadowed by the bulk of his Experimental Coil. Indeed, the entire laboratory can be said to be the Coil, for there is little else there apart from recording and calibrating apparatus.\n\nThe Coil is immense. Tesla said that it had a diameter exceeding fifty feet. Constructed around a central core (the base of the tall metal pole that I had seen protruding through the roof), the Coil is wound around numerous wooden and metal battens. I could make no sense of its design. I grasped that it was capable of using or transforming huge amounts of electricity. The power for it is sent up the mountain from Colorado Springs below; Tesla has paid for this by installing the town generators himself!\n\n\"I have all the electricity I want\"! he said. \"As you will probably find during the evenings\".\n\nI asked him what he meant.\n\n\"You will notice that from time to time the town lights momentarily dim. Sometimes they even go off altogether for a few seconds. It means we are at work up here! Let me show you\".\n\nHe led me out of the building and across the uneven ground outside. After a short distance, we came to a place where the side of the mountain dropped steeply away, and there, a long way below, was the whole extent of Colorado Springs.\n\n\"If you come up here one night I'll demonstrate,\" he promised. \"With a pull on one lever I can plunge that whole city into the dark\".\n\nAs we headed back, he said, \"You must indeed visit me one night. Night-time is the finest time in the mountains. It is a mistake to look down or around. The real interest is above us\"! He gestured towards the sky. \"I have never known such clarity of air, such moonlight. Nor have I ever seen such storms as occur here! I chose this site because of the frequency of storms. There is one coming at this moment, as it happens\".\n\nI glanced around me, but the sky was blue in every direction.\n\n\"The storm will arrive after seven this evening, in fact, let us examine my coherer, from which we can determine the exact time\".\n\nWe walked back to the laboratory. As we did so, I noticed that Randy Gilpin and his carriage had arrived, and were parked well away from where we were. Randy waved to me, and I waved back.\n\nTesla indicated one of the instruments I had noted earlier.\n\n\"This shows that a storm is currently in the region of Central City, about eighty miles to the north of us. Watch\"!\n\nHe indicated a part of the device that could be seen through a magnifying lens, and jabbed a finger at it at odd moments. After peering at it for a while, I saw what he was trying to indicate - a tiny electrical spark was bridging the visible gap between two metal studs.\n\n\"Each time it sparks it is registering a flash of lightning,\" Tesla explained. \"Sometimes I will note the discharge here, and more than an hour later I will hear the thunder rumbling in from far away\".\n\nTesla had moved to another instrument and noted down two or three readings from it. I followed him to it.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Mr Angier, would you be good enough to look at your clock this evening, and note the moment when you see the first flash of lightning. By my calculation it should be between 7 15 pm and 7 20 pm\".\n\n\"You can predict the exact moment\"? I said.\n\n\"Within about five minutes\".\n\n\"Then you could make your fortune with this alone\"! I exclaimed.\n\nHe looked uninterested.\n\n\"It is peripheral,\" he said. \"My work is purely experimental, and my main concern is to know when a storm is going to break so that I might make the best use of it\". He glanced over to where Gilpin was waiting. \"I see your carriage has returned, Mr Angier. You plan to make another visit to see me\"?\n\n\"I came to Colorado Springs for one reason only,\" I said. \"That is so that I might put a business proposition to you\".\n\n\"The best kind of proposition, in my experience,\" Tesla said gravely. \"I shall expect you the day after tomorrow\".\n\nHe explained that today was going to be taken up by a trip to the railhead to collect some more equipment.\n\nWith this I departed, and soon returned with Gilpin to the town.\n\nI must record that at exactly 7 19 pm there was a flash of lightning visible in the town, followed soon after by a crack of thunder. There then began a spectacular storm.\n\n13th July 1900.\n\nToday Tesla suggested I might like to take a walk with him.\n\n\"Perhaps now is the time when we should quietly discuss business. May I beg details of what you have in mind\"?\n\n\"This is what I am not entirely sure about -\" I began, and paused, trying to formulate the words.\n\n\"Do you propose to invest in my researches\"?\n\n\"No, sir, I do not,\" I was able to say. \"Let me say candidly that I am a wealthy man, Mr Tesla. I hope I might be able to assist you\".\n\n\"But not by investment, you say\".\n\n\"By purchase,\" I replied. \"I wish you to build me an electrical apparatus\".\n\n\"Which piece of apparatus do you require\"? he said. \"As you have seen my work is theoretical, experimental. None of it is for sale, and everything I am using at present is invaluable to me\".\n\n\"Before I left England,\" I said, \"I read a new article about your work in The Times. In the article, it was said that you had discovered on a theoretical basis that electricity might be transmitted through the air, and that you planned to demonstrate the principle in the near future. Many of your scientific colleagues have apparently said it is impossible, but you are confident of what you are doing. Would this be true\"?\n\nI stared directly into Tesla's eyes as I asked this final question, and saw that his expression and gestures became animated and expressive.\n\n\"Yes, it is entirely true\"! he cried, and at once launched into a wild and (to me) fairly incomprehensible account of what he planned.\n\nThe essence of what he said was that he had long ago established that the most efficient way of transmitting his polyphase electrical current was to boost it to high voltages and direct it along high-tension cables. Now he was able to show that if the current was boosted to an even greater voltage then it became of extremely high frequency, and no cables at all would be required. The current would be sent out, radiated, cast broadly into the aether, whereupon by a series of detectors or receivers the electricity could be captured once more and turned to use.\n\nWe had circled the large area of ground twice, and I kept my pace beside him.\n\nFinally, I said, \"Tell me this: if electrical energy may be transmitted, could physical matter also be sent from one place to another\"?\n\nThe steadiness of his answer surprised me. He said, \"Energy and matter are but two manifestations of the same force. Surely you realize this\"?\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I said.\n\n\"Then you already know the answer. Though I must add that I cannot see why anyone should wish to transmit matter\".\n\n\"But could you make me the apparatus that would achieve this\"?\n\n\"How much mass would be involved? What weight would there be? What size object\"?\n\n\"Never more than two hundred pounds,\" I said. \"And the size... let us say two yards in height, at most\".\n\nHe waved a hand dismissively. \"What sum are you offering me\"?\n\n\"What sum do you require\"?\n\n\"I desperately need eight thousand dollars, Mr Angier\".\n\nIt was more than I had planned, but still it was within my means.\n\nA few moments later, we were embracing on that windy plateau, clapping our hands against each other's shoulders.\n\nAs we drew apart, and clasped hands in contract together, a loud peal of thunder rang out somewhere in the mountains behind us, and rolled around us, rumbling and echoing in the narrow passes.\n\n14th July 1900.\n\nToday Tesla has quizzed me more closely about what I require of him. He is incurious about the magical effect I plan to achieve, but is concerned instead with practicalities. The size of the apparatus, the source of power for it, the weight it will need to be, the degree of portability required.\n\nI find myself admiring his analytical mind. Portability was one aspect I had not thought about at all, but of course, this is a critical factor for a touring magician.\n\nTesla's reaction to my project has finally convinced me of something that until now I have only suspected. Borden has not been to Tesla!\n\nI am learning about my old rival. Through Olivia, he was trying to misdirect me. His illusion uses the sort of flashy effects that ordinary people think are the power of electricity, but are in fact nothing more than flashy effects.\n\nBut Tesla works slowly! I am anxious about the passage of time. Naively, I had thought that once I commissioned Tesla it would be a matter of hours before he produced the mechanism I required. I see, by the abstracted expression he bears as he mutters to himself, that I have started a process of invention that might know no practical end.\n\nI have firm bookings in England in October and November, and must be home well before the first of them.\n\n8th August 1900.\n\nTesla told me on my arrival at the laboratory this morning that my apparatus was ready for demonstration, and in a state of great excitement, I readied myself to see it. When it came to it, though, the thing refused to function, and after I had watched Tesla fiddling with some of the wiring for more than three hours I returned here to the hotel.\n\n12th August 1900.\n\nAnother abortive demonstration today. I was disappointed by the outcome. Tesla seemed puzzled, claiming that his calculations could not be in error.\n\nThe failure is briefly recorded. The prototype apparatus is a smaller version of his Coil, with the wiring arranged in a different fashion. After a prolonged lecture about the principles (none of which I understood), Tesla produced a metal rod which he or Mr Alley had painted in a distinctive orange colour. He placed it on a platform, immediately beneath a kind of inverted cone of wiring; the apex of the cone focused directly on the rod.\n\nWhen at Tesla's instruction Mr Alley worked a large lever situated close by the original Coil, there was the noisy outburst of electrical discharge. Almost at once, the orange rod was surrounded by blue-white fire, which snaked around it in a most intimidating way. The noise and incandescence built up quickly, and soon it seemed as if molten particles of the rod itself were splashing to the floor.\n\nAfter a few seconds Tesla waved his hands dramatically, M r Alley threw back the control lever, the electricity instantly died away, and the rod was still in place.\n\nTesla immediately became absorbed in the mystery. Mr Alley has recommended me to stay away from the laboratory for a few days, but I am acutely conscious of time running out.\n\n18th August 1900.\n\nToday, after the orange-painted rod had failed to move again, Tesla picked it up and offered it to me to hold. A few seconds before it had been bathed in radiant light, with sparks flying in every direction. I took it from him, expecting my fingers to be burned by it. Instead, it was cold. This is the odd thing: it was not just cool, in the sense that it had not been heated, but actively cold, as if it had been surrounded by ice. I hefted the rod in my hand.\n\n\"Any more failures like this, Mr Angier,\" Tesla said, in a friendly enough voice, \"and I might be obliged to give you that as a souvenir\".\n\n\"I shall take it,\" I replied. \"Although I should prefer to take with me what I came here to buy\".\n\n\"Given enough time I shall move the Earth\".\n\n\"Time is what I do not have much of,\" I riposted, tossing the rod to the floor. \"And it is not the Earth I wish to move. Nor is it this metal stick\".\n\n\"Then name your preferred object,\" Tesla said, with sarcasm. \"I shall concentrate on that instead\".\n\n\"Mr Tesla,\" I said, \"I wish it to transmit a living body! A man\"!\n\n\"So you wish me to demonstrate my failures not on an iron rod, but on a human being? Whom do you nominate for this dangerous experiment\"?\n\n\"Why should it be dangerous\"? I said.\n\n\"Because all experiment is risky\".\n\n\"I am the one who will be using this\".\n\n\"You wish to submit yourself! Sir, I shall require the remainder of your money before I start experimenting on you\"!\n\n\"It is time for me to leave,\" I said, and turned away, feeling angry. I pushed past him and Alley, and made it to the outside. There was no sign of Randy Gilpin but I strode off anyway, determined if necessary to walk the whole way down to the town.\n\n\"Mr Angier, sir\"! Tesla was standing at the door to his laboratory. \"Let us not exchange hasty words. I should have explained properly to you. If I had known that you wished to transmit living organisms, you would not have presented me with such a challenge. It is difficult to deal with massy, inorganic compounds. Living tissue is not of the same order of problem\".\n\n\"What are you saying, Professor\"? I asked.\n\n\"If you wish me to transmit an organism, please return here tomorrow. It shall be done\".\n\nI nodded my confirmation then continued on my way, stepping on the loose gravel of the path that descended the mountainside.\n\nWhen I had walked about half a mile, my attention was caught by a flash of colour in the long grass beside the track, and I stopped to investigate. It was a short iron rod, painted orange, apparently identical to the one Tesla had been using. Thinking I might after all keep a souvenir of this extraordinary meeting with Tesla, I picked it up, and I have it with me now.\n\n19th August 1900.\n\nToday, when I came to the laboratory, Tesla said, \"I fear I am about to let you down. Much work remains, and I know how pressing is your return to Britain\".\n\n\"What has occurred\"? I asked.\n\n\"I believed it would be a simple matter with life organisms. The structure is so much simpler than that of the elements. Life already contains minute amounts of electricity. I was working on the assumption that all I had to do was boost that energy. I do not know why this has not worked! The computations were exact. Come and see the evidence for yourself\".\n\nInside the laboratory, I noticed Mr Alley who stood with his arms folded protectively. Beside him on the bench was a small wooden cage, containing a little black cat with white whiskers and paws, presently asleep.\n\n\"I hope you will not allow this, Mr Angier\"! Alley cried. \"I brought my children's cat on the firm promise that it would not be harmed. Mr Tesla insists that we submit the creature to an experiment that will undoubtedly kill it\"!\n\nHe led me to the apparatus, which I immediately saw had been entirely rebuilt overnight.\n\n\"What's going wrong\"? I said to Tesla. \"Yesterday you sounded so sure\".\n\n\"I have calculated and recalculated a dozen times. Alley has checked the mathematics too. It is an inexplicable dichotomy between theoretical and actual results. Such a thing has never happened to me before\".\n\n\"May I see the calculations\"? I said.\n\n\"Of course you may, but if you are not a mathematician I fear they will not convey much to you\".\n\nHe and Alley produced a great book in which his computations had been carried out, and together we studied them for a long time. Tesla showed me, as best I was able to understand, the principle behind them, and the calculated results. I took the calculations for granted and concentrated on the results, and then an unexpected glimmering of sense shone through.\n\n\"You say that this determines the distance\"? I said.\n\n\"That is a variable. For purposes of experimentation I have been using a value of one hundred metres, but such a distance is academic, since, as you see, nothing I try to transmit travels any distance at all\".\n\n\"And this value here\"? I said, pointing at another line.\n\n\"The angle. I have been using compass points. It will direct in any of three hundred and sixty degrees from the apex of the energy vortex\".\n\n\"Do you have a setting for elevation\"? I asked.\n\n\"I am not using it. Until the apparatus is fully working, I am merely aiming into the clear air to the east of the laboratory. One must be careful not to cause a rematerialization in a position already occupied by another mass! Something terrible might happen\".\n\nSuddenly I was struck by inspiration! I dashed out of the laboratory and stared from the doorway to the east. When I returned to the laboratory, I went straight to my portmanteau and pulled out the iron rod I had found beside the path yesterday evening. I held it up for Tesla to see.\n\n\"Your experimental object, I do believe\"? I said.\n\n\"Yes it is\".\n\nI told him where I had found it, and when. He hurried across to the apparatus where its twin was lying. He held the two together, and Alley and I stood with him, marveling at their identical appearance.\n\n\"These marks, Mr Angier\"! Tesla breathed in awe, lightly fingering a crisscross patch neatly etched into the metal. \"I made them so that I might prove by identification that this object had been transmitted through the aether. But-\"\n\n\"It has made a facsimile of itself\"! Alley said.\n\n\"Where did you say you found this, sir\"? Tesla demanded.\n\nI led the two men outside and explained, pointing down the mountain. Tesla stared in silent thought.\n\nThen he said, \"I need to see the actual place! Show me\"! To Alley he said, \"Bring the theodolite, and some measuring tape! As soon as you can\"!\n\nAnd with that he set off down the path, clutching me by my upper arm, imploring me to show him the exact location of the find.\n\nI eventually came to the place where I found the rod. It was exactly to the east of the laboratory. Tesla was evidently satisfied, and he was deep in thought as we walked back up the mountain to his laboratory.\n\nI too had been thinking, and as soon as we were inside once more I said, \"Since you are able to calibrate the device, rather than simply aim your experiments into the air to the east of us, could you not send them a shorter distance? Perhaps across the laboratory itself, or outside to the area surrounding the building\"?\n\n\"We evidently think alike, Mr Angier\"!\n\nI had never seen Tesla so cheerful, and he and Alley set to work immediately. I went to sit silently at the rear of the laboratory.\n\nAfter a longer period than I can describe here, Tesla finally said, \"Mr Angier, I believe we are ready\".\n\nWhen he inserted the experimental rod, and manipulated his lever, a most satisfactory bang signaled successful completion of the experiment. The three of us rushed outside, and sure enough, there on the grass, was the familiar orange-painted iron rod.\n\nBack in the laboratory, we all examined the \"original\" piece. Stone cold it was, but undoubtedly identical to the twin that had been made of it across the emptiness of space.\n\n\"Tomorrow, sir,\" Tesla said to me, \"tomorrow, and with the consent of my noble assistant here, we shall try to safely transport the cat from one place to another. If that can be achieved, I take it you will be satisfied\"?\n\n\"Indeed, Mr Tesla,\" I said warmly. \"Indeed\".\n\n20th August 1900.\n\nAnd indeed it has been done. The cat has crossed the aether unharmed!\n\nThere was a small hitch, however, but Tesla promises me another demonstration tomorrow, and this time he has told me there will be no more problems.\n\n11th October 1900.\n\nCaldlow House, Derbyshire\n\nI did not expect to live to write these words. Following the accidental death of my elder brother Henry, I have finally come to the title and lands of my father.\n\nI am now permanently in residence in the family home, and have abandoned my career as a stage illusionist. My daily routine is occupied with the administration of the estate.\n\nI now sign myself,\n\nRupert, 14th Earl of Colderdale.\n\n12th November 1900.\n\nI have just returned from a visit of a few days to my old house in London. My intention had been to clear out the place, and my former workshop, and sell both properties on the open market. The Caldlow estate is on the verge of bankruptcy and I am in a hurry to raise some cash for urgent repairs to both the house and some of the estate buildings. Naturally, I have been cursing myself for wasting practically all the accumulated wealth from my stage career on Tesla. On leaving Colorado, as I returned to England in haste on the news of Henry's death, I gave him the rest of the fee. It did not occur to me then how radically my whole life was to be changed by the news.\n\nReturning to Idmiston Villas had an unanticipated effect on me, though. I found it full of memories, of course, and these were as mixed as all such memories can be, but above all, I was reminded of my first days in London. Then I was hardly more than a boy, then I met Julia.\n\nI finally sent a note to Julia's address. Rather to my surprise, but to my intense pleasure, she consented to meet me, and two days ago, I spent an afternoon with her and the children at the house of one of her women friends.\n\nJulia, at first cool and remote, was obviously much affected by my expressions of shock and emotion (Edward, sixteen now, is so tall and good-looking; Lydia and Florence are so beautiful and gentle; I could not keep my eyes off them all afternoon!) and soon she was speaking kindly and warmly to me.\n\nI then told her my news. Even when we were married and living together I had never revealed my past to her, so what I had to say to her was a triple surprise. Firstly, I had to tell her that I had once left a family and estate of which she had never heard, secondly, that I had now returned to it, and thirdly, that I had decided to abandon my stage career.\n\nJulia took all this calmly. A little later, she asked me if I was sure, I should abandon my career. I said I saw no alternative. She told me that although we were separated she had continued to follow my magic career with admiration, regretting only that she were no longer a part of it.\n\nAs we spoke, I felt rising in me, or more correctly sinking out of me, a despair that I had thrown away my wife, and more unforgivably my splendid children, for the sake of the American woman.\n\nYesterday, before leaving London, I met with Julia a second time. This time the children were not with her.\n\nI begged her forgiveness for all the sins I had committed against her. I pleaded with her to return to me, and live with me once more as my wife.\n\nShe said no, but promised that she would consider carefully. I deserve no better.\n\nLater in the day, I caught the overnight train to Sheffield. I thought of nothing but reconciliation with Julia.\n\n17th November 1900.\n\nJulia has put to me a proposition about a way we could possibly be together in the future. I have to make a simple decision.\n\nShe says she will return to me, live with me once more as my wife, but only if I resume my magic career. She wishes me to leave Caldlow House and return to Idmiston Villas. She says that she and the children do not wish to move to a house in a remote and, to them, unknown part of Derbyshire.\n\nTo try to persuade me that her proposal is also for my own good, she adds four arguments.\n\nFirst, she says the stage is in her blood as much as mine and she would wish to participate wholly in all my future stage activities.\n\nAt the beginning of this year, she next argues, I was at the peak of my profession, but that by default the wretched Borden is taking my laurels. Apparently, he is continuing to perform his version of the switch illusion.\n\nJulia then reminds me that the only reliable way I know of earning money is to perform magic, and that I have a duty to go on supporting her as well as running the family estate she has never seen and had never heard of until last week.\n\nFinally, she points out that I will not lose my inheritance by continuing to work in London and the house and everything that goes with the estate will still be waiting for me when the time comes for retirement. Urgent matters, such as repairs, can be managed from London almost as easily as from the house.\n\nSo I have returned to Derbyshire, because I need some time alone to think.\n\n21st November 1900.\n\nI am at Idmiston Villas, and I have found here a letter from Alley, the assistant to Nikola Tesla. I now transcribe it:\n\nSeptember 27, 1900.\n\nMr Angier, Sir:\n\nI don't expect you have heard but Nikola Tesla has left Colorado already, and is probably now in New York or New Jersey. His laboratory here has been seized by his creditors, and it is currently looking for a purchaser.\n\nHowever, in some matters, Mr Tesla is a man of honor, and before our work here was completed, your equipment was as instructed shipped to your workshop.\n\nOnce the apparatus has been correctly put together (I wrote the assembly instructions myself) you will find it is in complete working order, and operates exactly to the agreed technical specification. The device is self-regulating, and should continue to work without adjustment or repair for many years. All you should do is keep it clean and brighten the electrical contact points if they become dull. (Mr Tesla enclosed a set of spares for those parts, which will, in the ordinary course, require replacement.)\n\nI would of course be fascinated to learn what illusions you work with this extraordinary invention, because I am one of your greatest admirers.\n\nLet me say in conclusion, Sir, that I was honored to play some part, no matter how small, in building this apparatus for you.\n\nYours most sincerely, Fare ham K. Alley, Dip. Eng.\n\nAs soon as I read this, I hurried around to my workshop. I enquired of my neighbours there if a large package had been delivered from the USA, but they knew nothing of it.\n\n22nd November 1900.\n\nI showed Alley's letter to Julia this morning, quite forgetting that I had not yet told her about my most recent trip to the USA, and what I had done there.\n\n\"So this is where all your money has gone\"? she said.\n\n\"Yes\".\n\n\"What is so special about the illusion\"? she asked.\n\n\"Not the illusion itself,\" I replied. \"It is the means by which it is achieved\".\n\n\"Is Mr Borden something to do with this\"?\n\n\"You have not forgotten Mr Borden, I see\".\n\n\"My dear, it was Alfred Borden who separated us. I have had many years to reflect, and I trace everything that went wrong back to that day when he attacked me\". She spoke in quiet rage and without any trace of self-pity. \"If he had not hurt me I should not have lost our first child. Your restlessness began then. Even the dear children who followed could not compensate for the cruelty and stupidity of what Borden did that day, and that the feud between you continues is proof of the outrage you too must still feel\".\n\n\"I have never spoken to you about that,\" I said. \"How do you know\"?\n\n\"Because I am not a fool, Rupert, and I have seen occasional remarks in the magic magazines\". I had not known she continued to subscribe to those. \"You are still prime amongst my concerns,\" she said. \"I wonder only why you have never spoken to me of his attacks\".\n\n\"Because I am, I suppose, a little ashamed of the feud\".\n\n\"Surely he is the aggressor\"?\n\n\"I have had to defend myself,\" I said.\n\nI told her about my investigations into his past, and my attempts to discover how he worked the illusion. Then I described the hopes I had for Tesla's equipment.\n\nJulia was the perfect audience for my enthusiasms about Tesla's device, and for the next hour or more, we discussed all the possibilities it presented to me.\n\nFinally, Julia said, \"Why do we not begin our enquiries with the Post Office\"? So it was, two hours later, that we located two immense crates addressed to me, waiting safely in the dead-letter section of the Mount Pleasant Sorting Office.\n\n15th December 1900.\n\nThe Tesla apparatus has been erected in my workshop ever since I picked it up from Mount Pleasant. I have been rehearsing.\n\nThe apparatus is in full working order, and has been ingeniously designed to work on all presently known versions of electrical supply. This means I may travel with my show, even to Europe, the USA and (Alley claims in his instructions) the Far East.\n\nHowever, I cannot perform my show unless the theatre has electrical current supplied. In future, I will have to check this before I accept any new bookings.\n\nAll stage illusions are given names by their inventors, and it is by these that they become known in the profession. After some thought I have decided to call the Tesla invention In a Flash, and by this it will become known.\n\nI also use this entry to note that as of last Monday, 10th December, Julia and the children have returned and are living with me at Idmiston Villas. They will see Caldlow House for the first time when we spend the Christmas holiday there.\n\n31st December 1900.\n\nI write these words as the nineteenth century draws to a close. In an hour from now, I shall descend to our drawing room, where Julia and the children are waiting for me, and together we shall see in the New Year and the New Century.\n\nBecause secrecy again has a hold on me, I must say that what Hutton and I did earlier this evening had to be done.\n\nThis evening, soon after nightfall, I told Julia what I was about to do, and left her waiting in her sitting room.\n\nI found Hutton, and we left the house and went together across the East Lawn towards the family vault. We transported the prestige materials on a handcart sometimes used by the gardeners.\n\nHutton and I had only storm lanterns to guide us. As the wooden portal swung open, Hutton declared his unease. I felt terrific sympathy for him.\n\nI said, \"Hutton, I don't expect you to go through with this. You may wait for me here if you like. Or you could return to the house, and I'll continue alone\".\n\n\"No, my Lord,\" he replied in his honest way. \"I have agreed to this\".\n\nLeaving the cart by the entrance, we ventured inside. The inner door was unlocked, but it was stiff and heavy to move aside.\n\nHutton spoke beside me.\n\n\"Sir, should I collect the prestige materials\"?\n\nI could just make out his features in the lantern's glow.\n\n\"Yes, I think so. Do you need me to help you\"?\n\n\"If you would wait at the bottom of the steps, sir\".\n\nHe walked quickly up the flight of steps, and I knew he wanted to be done as soon as possible.\n\nHere in this place were most of my forebears, lying in boxes and shrouds.\n\nI was torn by my fears. I wanted to follow Hutton up to the outside air, yet I knew I had to plunge further on into the depths of the vault. I am a rational man who seeks explanations and welcomes the scientific method, yet for those few seconds Hutton was away from me I was tormented by the easy rush of the illogical.\n\nThen at last, I heard him again on the steps, dragging the first of the large sacks containing the prestige materials. I had to put down my lantern while we got the sack through the door, and because Hutton had left his own light with the handcart, we were working in almost total darkness.\n\nI said to him, \"I'm profoundly glad you are here to help me, Hutton\".\n\n\"I realize that, my Lord. I should not have cared to do this myself alone\".\n\n\"Then let us complete it quickly\".\n\nThis time we went back to the handcart together, and dragged down the second large sack.\n\n\"We'll leave the sacks here,\" I said. \"As far off the floor as possible. I'll come down here again tomorrow, when it's daylight. With a better torch\".\n\n\"I completely understand, sir\".\n\nWithout saying another word between us, we returned quickly to the surface, and pushed the outer door closed behind us. I shuddered.\n\nIn the cold air of the night-time garden, Hutton and I shook hands.\n\n\"Thank you for helping me, Hutton,\" I said. \"I had no idea that it would be like that down there\".\n\n\"Nor I, my Lord. Will you be requiring anything else from me this evening\"?\n\nI considered.\n\n\"Would you and your wife care to join myself and Lady Colderdale at midnight? We plan to see in the New Year\".\n\n\"Thank you, sir. We shall be honoured to do so\".\n\nAnd that was how our expedition ended. Hutton dragged the handcart away towards the garden shed, and I crossed the East Lawn then walked around the periphery of the house to the main entrance. I came directly to this room, to write my account while events were still fresh.\n\nNow this account has been written, and it is close to midnight. It is time for me to seek out my family and household for the simple and familiar ceremony that celebrates the end of one year and, in this case, one century, then welcomes in the next.\n\n1st January 1901.\n\nI have been back to the vault, and moved the prestige materials to a better position.\n\n15th January 1901.\n\nIdmiston Villas\n\nYesterday, the Tesla apparatus arrived back from Derbyshire, and with Adam Wilson's assistance, I immediately unpacked it and erected it. According to my clock, it took under fifteen minutes. We must be able to be sure of doing it within ten minutes, when working in a theatre. Mr Alley's sheet of instructions declares that when he and Tesla were testing its portability they were able to erect the whole thing in under twelve minutes.\n\nAdam Wilson knows the secret of the illusion, as he must. Adam has been working for me for more than five years, and I believe I can trust him. To be as sure as reasonably possible I have offered him a confidentiality bonus of ten pounds, to be paid into an accumulating fund in his name after each successful performance. He and Gertrude are expecting their second child.\n\n14th February 1901.\n\nI rehearsed In a Flash twice yesterday, and will do so twice again tomorrow. I dare not make it any more than that. I shall be performing it on Saturday evening at the Trocadero in Holloway Road, then at least once again in the week following. I believe that if I can perform it regularly enough, then extra rehearsals should not be necessary.\n\nTesla warned me that there would be aftereffects, and these are indeed profound. It is no trivial matter to use the apparatus. Each time I pass through it, I suffer.\n\nIn the first place, there is the physical pain. My body is torn apart, disassembled. In a fraction of a second, my body is converted into electrical waves. It is radiated through space. It is reassembled at its designated target.\n\nSlam! I am broken apart! Slam! I am together again!\n\nIt is a violent shock that explodes in every part of me, in every direction. A millionth of a second of total agony! That is how it feels.\n\nYet I arrive in the selected place, and I am exactly as I was that millionth of a second earlier. I am whole in myself, and identical to myself, but I am in the shock of acute pain.\n\nThe first time I used the Tesla apparatus, in the basement of Caldlow House, with no warning of what I was to experience, I collapsed to the floor in the belief that I had died. It did not seem possible that my heart, my brain, could survive such an explosion of pain. I had no thoughts, no emotional reactions. It felt as if I had died, and I acted as if I had died.\n\nAs I slumped to the floor, Julia, who of course was there with me for the test, ran to my side. My first lucid memory in the post-death world is of her gentle hands reaching into my shirt to feel for a sign of life. I opened my eyes, in shock and amazement, happy beyond words to find her beside me, to feel her tenderness. Quickly I was able to stand, to reassure her that I was well, to hold her and kiss her, to be myself once more.\n\nIn truth, then, physical recovery from this brutal experience is itself speedy, but the mental consequences are formidable.\n\nOn the day of that first test in Derbyshire, I forced myself to repeat the test in the afternoon, but as a result, I was cast into the darkest gloom for much of the Christmas period. I had died twice. I had become one of the walking dead, a damned soul.\n\nAnd the reminders of what I did then are the materials that later had to be put away. I could not even face that gruesome task until New Year's Eve, as I have described.\n\nYesterday, here in London, in the electrical brightness and familiarity of my workshop, with the Tesla equipment reassembled, I felt I should undergo two more rehearsals. I am a performer, a professional. I must give a glamour to what I do. I must appear to be a magician who has successfully performed the impossible.\n\nI must, by careful art, make my miracle less miraculous. I must emerge from the elemental transmitter as if I have not been slammed apart, and slammed together again.\n\nSo I have been trying to learn how to prepare for the pain, how to react to it without keeling over, how to step forward with my arms raised and with a flashing smile to bow and acknowledge applause.\n\n17th February 1901.\n\nLast night I safely crossed the aether from the stage of the Trocadero to the royal box. The equipment worked perfectly.\n\nI was able to disguise completely the shock of the impact on me. I can say that practice with the apparatus has meant the terrible shock is not nearly as terrible as before, and that it has been getting slightly better each time I try it. I can foresee that in a month or so I will be able to bear the effect with outward indifference.\n\nI also note that the consequent gloom I suffer is much less than after my first attempts.\n\n2nd March 1901.\n\nIn London.\n\nI have an unprecedented thirty-five confirmed bookings in my appointments diary, accepted for the period of the next four months. Three of these are for shows in my own stage name, and one of these is to be called The Great Danton Entertains.\n\nI shall be roaming the country. Brighton, Exeter, Kidderminster, Portsmouth, Ayr, Folkestone, Manchester, Sheffield, Aberystwyth, York, all these and many more will greet me on my first tour, as well as the capital itself, where I have several dates.\n\nThe agent is already speaking of foreign tours, with perhaps yet another trip to the USA.\n\n10th July 1901.\n\nI have been continually revising and rehearsing In a Flash for some months, and it is now more or less a perfected skill. All my earlier hopes for it have come true. I can pass through the aether without registering any reaction to the physical traumas I endure. The transition is smooth, and from the point of view of the audience impossible to explain.\n\nThe mental aftereffects are not a problem anymore. I suffer no agonies of depression, or self-doubt. To the contrary (and I confide this to no one, and record it in no other document than in this secret and lockable diary), the wrenching apart of my body has become a pleasure to which I am almost addicted. At first, I was disheartened by the imaginings of death, of living in an afterlife, but now I nightly experience my transmission as a rebirth, a renewal of self. In the early days I was concerned by the many times I should have to perform the trick to keep in practice, but now as soon as I have completed one performance I begin to crave the next.\n\nThree weeks ago, during a temporary break in my round of engagements, I erected the Tesla equipment in my workshop and put myself through the process. Not to try out new performance techniques, not to perfect existing ones, but purely for the physical pleasure of the experience.\n\nDisposal of the prestige materials produced at each show is still a problem, but after all these weeks, we have developed a few routines so that the job is done with a minimum of fuss.\n\n3rd September 1902.\n\nIn London.\n\nA momentous revelation!\n\nEarly yesterday evening, while I was resting between shows at Daly's Theatre in Islington, a man called at the stage door to see me. When I saw his card, I asked for him to be shown immediately to my dressing room. It was Mr Arthur Koenig, the young journalist from the Evening Star who had given me so much food for thought about Borden. I was not surprised to learn that Mr Koenig now has the position of Deputy News Editor of that paper. He entered cordially and shook my hand.\n\n\"I just saw your matinee, Mr Danton\"! he said. \"My hearty congratulations to you. I confess myself baffled and entertained in equal measure\".\n\n\"I'm glad to hear it,\" I said, and told my dresser to pour Mr Koenig a small glass of whisky. When this was done, I asked my dresser to leave us alone together, and to return in fifteen minutes.\n\n\"Your good health, sir\"! Koenig announced, raising his glass. \"Or should I say, my Lord\"?\n\nI stared at him in surprise.\n\n\"How the devil do you know about that\"?\n\n\"Why do you think I should not? The news of your brother's death reached the press in the usual way, and was duly reported\".\n\n\"I've seen those reports,\" I replied. 'None of them mentioned me\".\n\n\"I think it might be because few in Fleet Street know you by more than your stage name. As a true admirer, I connected you to Henry Angier\".\n\n\"Nothing escapes you, does it\"? I said.\n\n\"Not that kind of information, sir. Don't worry, your secret is safe with me. I assume it is a secret\"?\n\n\"I have always kept the two parts of my life separate. In that sense, it is a secret and I'd be glad if you would treat it as such\".\n\n\"You have my word, my Lord\".\n\n\"May I ask,\" I said eventually, \"to what I owe the pleasure of this visit\"?\n\n\"I've come to apologize in the matter of Mr Borden, your rival. I confess that all my elaborate theories about him were in error, while your theory, blunt and simple, was correct\".\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" I said.\n\n\"When I came to see you before, I held some theory of Mr Borden performing a greater magic than any that had existed before\".\n\n\"I remember,\" I said. \"You wisely convinced me of it. I was grateful to you-\"\n\n\"You, however, had a plainer explanation. Borden is not one man but two, you said. Twins, you said. Identical twin brothers, each taking the place of the other as required\".\n\n\"But you proved-\"\n\n\"You were right, sir! Mr Borden's act is indeed based on twins. Alfred Borden is a name conflated from two: Albert and Frederick, twin brothers, who perform together as one\".\n\n\"That's not true\"! I said.\n\n\"But it was your own theory\".\n\n\"You swiftly disabused me. You had evidence-\"\n\n\"Much of which turns out to have been falsified. I was a young reporter, not then fully practised in my profession. I have since learnt to check facts, to double-check them, then to check them once more\".\n\n\"But I went into the matter myself,\" I said. \"I examined the hospital records of his birth, the register of the school he attended -\"\n\n\"Falsified documents, Mr Angier. The Bordens have built their lives around sustaining this illusion. Nothing about them can be trusted\".\n\n\"I investigated most carefully,\" I insisted. \"I knew there were two brothers with those names, but one is two years younger than the other\"!\n\n\"Both coincidentally born in May, as I recall. It does not take much forgery to change a birth record from 8th May 1856 to 18th May 1858\".\n\n\"There was a photograph of the two brothers, taken together\"!\n\n\"Yes, and one so easy to find! It was left as a red herring for such as you and me to stumble across. As we did\".\n\n\"But the two brothers were clearly unalike. I saw the portrait myself\"!\n\n\"And so did I. Indeed, I have a copy of it in my office. The distinction between their facial characteristics is remarkable. But surely you understand the deceptive use of stage make-up\".\n\nI was thunderstruck by the news, and stared at the floor, unable to think coherently.\n\n\"Are you sure of this\"? I demanded. \"Totally sure\"? Koenig was nodding slowly. \"For instance, have you ever seen the two brothers together\"?\n\n\"This is the basis of my certainty. Just once, and then only briefly, they met in my presence\".\n\n\"Were you following them\"?\n\n\"I was following one of them,\" Koenig corrected me. \"I followed Mr Borden from his house one evening in August. He walked alone into Regents Park. I was following at a distance of about a hundred yards. As he walked round the Inner Circle, a man approached him from the opposite direction. As they met, they paused for about three seconds and spoke together. Then they walked on as before. Now, though, Borden was carrying a small leather case. The man he had spoken to soon passed me, and as he did so I could see that he looked exactly like Borden\".\n\nI stared at Koenig thoughtfully.\n\n\"How do you know that the man, who walked on, the one now carrying the case, was not the man who had spoken to Borden? He could simply have walked back the way he had come. And if that was so, wouldn't it have been the Borden you had been following who passed you\"?\n\n\"I know what I saw, my Lord. They were wearing different clothes, perhaps for reasons of a clever trick, but this fact made it possible for me to distinguish between them. They met, they passed on, they were identical\".\n\nMy mind was focused. I was thinking rapidly about the mechanics of mounting a theatrical magic performance. If it were true that they were twins then both brothers would have to be present in the theatre at each show. This would mean that the backstage staff would inevitably know the secret. I already knew that Borden did not box the stage, and there are always people hanging around in the wings during a show, seeing too much. If Borden's act was based on identical twins, then surely the secret would have leaked out years ago?\n\nOtherwise, what was the explanation? It could only be that the secrecy was maintained before and after the show. That Borden-1, so to speak, would arrive at the theatre with his apparatus and props, with Borden-2 already concealed in one of the pieces. Borden-2 would make his appearance during the performance, while Borden-1 went into hiding in the props on-stage.\n\nIt was possible, and if that was all, there was to it I might be able to accept it. But Borden must have a team working with him: an ingenieur of course, one or more assistants who appeared on stage, several carriers and shifters, an agent. If all these people were privy to his secret then their ability to keep quiet about it was remarkable.\n\nOn the other hand, and much more likely in view of human nature, if they were not to be trusted, Borden-1 and Borden-2 would have to engage in concealment.\n\nBeyond this, there were the day-to-day realities of theatrical life. For example, on the days when there was a matinee performance, what would Borden-2 (the one concealed in the apparatus) do between shows? Would he remain hidden while his brother relaxed in the green room with the other artistes? Would he let himself out secretly, then skulk alone in the dressing room until it was time for the next show?\n\nHow did the two of them get into and out of the theatres without being spotted? Stage door managers are jealous guardians of the way. There are always alternative ways into the building, through the scenery bay or front of house, but again this suggests a need for constant secrecy and preparation, and a willingness to put up with not inconsiderable discomfort.\n\n\"I see I have given you something to think about,\" Koenig said, interrupting my train of thought.\n\n\"You're sure of your facts this time\"? I said.\n\n\"Yes, sir. Upon my very word\".\n\nI stood up, to indicate that the interview was at an end.\n\nKoenig picked up his hat and coat, and went to the door, which I held open for him.\n\nI said to him, as casually as I could, \"You show no curiosity about how I perform my own illusion\".\n\n\"I take it that it's magic, sir\".\n\n\"You don't then suspect me of having an identical twin\"?\n\n\"I know you have not\".\n\n\"So you investigated me,\" I said. \"And what about Borden? Is he wondering how I work the effect\"?\n\nMr Koenig gave me a broad wink.\n\n\"I'm sure he and his brother would not like you to know that they burn with curiosity about you, sir\". He extended his hand, and we shook. \"Once again, my congratulations. If I may say so, it has been reassuring to see you in such good health\".\n\nHe was gone before I could respond to that, but I think I know what he meant.\n\n7th September 1902.\n\nIt already seems that I shall be busily engaged from the middle of October until March or April next year. My estimated income from these performances will make me rich beyond the wildest dreams of my youth. By the end of next year I shall, in all probability, need never work again.\n\nWhich brings me to an explanation of Koenig's parting remark.\n\nA few months ago, when I was in the first rush of perfecting the presentation of In a Flash, I thought of a new final twist to the illusion. I arranged, by a combination of carefully positioned lights and use of make-up, that at the end of my act, after I had passed through the aether, I would look exhausted. I would seem worn by the magical transformation. I would be a man who had flirted with death, and who now showed the unmistakable traces.\n\nThis effect has .become a routine part of my act. Throughout my show, I move carefully, I turn with a slight stiffness of the waist and back, I walk with my shoulders hunched. As the final curtain falls I appear to most of the audience as if, I am not long for this world.\n\nApart from the effect itself, I have a long-term strategy in mind. I am planning and preparing for my own death. Next year I wish to retire from the stage for good. I want to be free of the endless touring, of the long journeys, the overnight stays in theatrical lodgings. I am sick of the need for secrecy about what I do, and I always fear another round of attacks from Borden.\n\nMost of all, my children are growing up and I wish to be with them as they do so. Edward is soon to depart to university, and the girls will no doubt be married soon.\n\nBy this time next year, I shall be, as I say, financially independent, and with prudent investment, the Caldlow estate should be able to provide for my family for the rest of my life and theirs. The life of The Great Danton, of Rupert Angier, shall come to a cancerous end, brought on by the rigours of his career, at some point in the autumn of 1903.\n\nMeanwhile, without publicity or announcement, the 14th Earl of Colderdale will at much the same time take up the reins of his inheritance.\n\nThus the explanation of Koenig's remark about my \"surprising\" good health. He is a sharp man, who knows more about me than I wish he did.\n\nI have been reflecting a great deal about his theory that there is not one Borden but two. I remain unsure.\n\nThis is because of the endless complications of living with the deception. What about everyday life? No artiste is constantly in work, however successful his or her career. There are periods of rest, both voluntary and involuntary. There are necessary delays between bookings. There are holidays, illnesses, family crises.\n\nIf Borden is not one man but two, and one of the men is always in hiding so that the other might seem to be the \"only\" Alfred Borden, where and how is the hiding going on? What happens in the life of the hidden man while he is hiding? How does he make contact with his brother? Do they ever meet, and if so how do they arrange not to be spotted by anyone?\n\nHow many other people know about the deception, and how can Borden be certain the secret is safe with them?\n\nSpeaking in particular of other people, what of Borden's wife? And what of his children?\n\nIf Borden is two men, they cannot both be husband to the wife, nor both be father to the children. Which of them is husband, which the father? Borden's wife is a woman of good background and by all accounts no fool. What does she in fact know about Borden?\n\nIs she being kept in the dark about his true identity? Would she suspect nothing, discern no difference at all between the two men?\n\nWhat about private jokes and observations, shared personal memories, matters of physical intimacy? Is it conceivable that the two men would collaborate to such an extent that even personal matters are dragged into the precautions and secrecy that surround a mere stage illusion?\n\nThe contrary is harder to believe; that Borden's wife knows the truth of the matter and is prepared for some reason to put up with it. It is a situation full of instability.\n\nBoth of these explanations are so unlikely that I am forced to believe in a third. The Borden brothers have deliberately not told the wife the truth, and have tried to deceive her, but she has herself made the deception unimportant. In other words, she has worked out what is going on (how could she not?), but for reasons of her own has decided to agree with it.\n\nIn spite of the fact that this theory contains its own mysteries, I find it the most reasonable explanation, but even so, the whole business is unbelievable.\n\nI would go to considerable lengths to protect my secrets, but I would not let secrecy become an obsession. Could Borden, and Borden's supposed brother, be as obsessive as Koenig makes them out to be?\n\nI am still in two minds about this!\n\nIn the end it does not matter, for a trick is a trick and everyone who sees it knows that a deception is being performed. But Julia suffered horribly because of the feud, and my own life came damnably close to its end because of it. I believe Borden is such a man as to make a fetish of his secrets and it was my misfortune to tangle with him.\n\nAlso my luck, as a direct consequence of the feud, to think of the illusion that is making my fortune!\n\n30th April 1903.\n\nI have told Unwin to continue accepting bookings through to the end of the year, and for the early months of 1904. However, I shall be dead by the end of September. Probably it will occur on Saturday, 19th September.\n\n20th May 1903.\n\nI have cancelled both my performances tonight, tomorrow's are at risk, and as I draft these words, I am anxiously awaiting Julia's arrival.\n\nI am a fool, a damned, bloody fool!\n\nLast night, my second performance was halfway through. I have recently added a new card trick to my repertoire. In this, a member of the audience is invited up to the stage. He takes a card and writes his name on the face of it. I tear off a corner of the card, and give it to the volunteer to hold. The rest of the card is placed inside a paper envelope, which is ignited. When the flames have gone out, I produce a large orange. I cut it in half and it is found to contain the signed card, and the torn-off corner still of course fits.\n\nLast night my volunteer was what I thought must be a local man; he was tall and strong, had a florid complexion, and when he spoke I heard a Suffolk accent. He was sitting in the centre of the front row and he offered himself as soon as I called for someone to come up on stage. That should have alerted me to likely trouble. However, I began doing the trick.\n\nHow could I not have guessed it was Borden?! He even gave me a clue, because the name he wrote on the playing card was Alf Redbone, a transparent near-anagram, yet in my preoccupations, I took it to be his real name.\n\nWith the card trick completed, I shook his hand, thanked him by name, and added my applause to that of the audience as he was led by Hester, my present female assistant, towards the stalls ramp.\n\nI did not notice that Redbone's seat was still empty a few minutes later, as I moved towards the start of In a Flash.\n\nI noticed his absence when it was too late; the apparatus was in operation and I had to complete the trick.\n\nAt this point in the show, nothing can be modified. Even my chosen target area is fixed; setting the coordinates is too intricate and time-consuming to be done at any time other than before a performance. The previous night I had set the apparatus for both of yesterday's performances so that I would arrive in the highest loge at stage left, which by arrangement with the management was kept empty for both shows. The loge was at the same approximate height as the main balcony, and could be seen from almost every other part of the auditorium.\n\nI had arranged it so that I should materialize on the very rail of the box itself, facing down into the stalls a long way below, apparently struggling to keep my balance. Everything had gone exactly to plan during the first performance, and my magical transformation brought shouts of alarm from the audience, followed by thunderous applause as I swung down to the stage on the rope thrown up to me by Hester.\n\nTo arrive on the rail of the loge facing down to the audience, I have to stand inside the Tesla apparatus with my back towards the loge. The audience cannot know it, of course, but the position in which I arrange my body is exactly recreated at the instant of arrival. From my place inside the apparatus I could not therefore see where I was about to arrive.\n\nWith Borden somewhere around, a terrible certainty struck me that he was about to sabotage me yet again! What if he was lurking inside the loge, and gave me a shove as I arrived on the ledge? I felt the electrical tension mounting ineluctably around me. I could not prevent myself turning anxiously around to look up at the box. I could just make it out through the deadly blue-white electrical sparks. All seemed well; there was nothing there to block my arrival, and although I couldn't see into the box itself, where the seats are placed, it did not look as if anyone was there.\n\nBorden's intent was much more sinister, and a moment later, I found out what it was. In the very instant that I turned to look up at the loge, two things happened simultaneously.\n\nThe first was that the transmission of my body actually began.\n\nThe second was that electrical power to the apparatus cut out, disconnecting the current instantly. The blue fires vanished, the electrical field died.\n\nI remained on the stage, standing within the wooden cage of the apparatus in full view of the audience. I was staring over my shoulder at the loge.\n\nThe transmission had been interrupted! But it had begun before it was stopped, and now I could see an image of myself on the rail; there was my ghost, my double, momentarily frozen in the stance I had adopted when I turned to look, half twisted, half crouching, looking away and up. It was a thin, insubstantial copy of myself, a partial prestige. Even as I looked, this image of myself straightened in alarm, threw out his arms, and collapsed backwards and out of sight into the loge itself!\n\nAppalled at what I had seen I stepped forward out of the coils of the Tesla cage. On cue, the spotlight came on, illuminating the whole loge to pick out my intended materialization. The people in the audience looked up at the loge, already half anticipating the trick. They started to applaud, but the noise faded away to nothing. There was nothing to see.\n\nI stood alone on the stage. My illusion was ruined.\n\n\"Curtain\"! I yelled into the wings. \"Bring down the curtain\"!\n\nAt last, the technician heard me and the curtain came down, separating me from the audience. Hester appeared at a run.\n\n\"What happened\"? she cried.\n\n\"That man who came up from the audience! Where is he\"?\n\n\"I don't know! I thought he went back to his seat\".\n\n\"He got backstage somehow! You are supposed to make sure these people leave the stage\"!\n\nI pushed her aside angrily and lifted up the fabric of the curtain. At a crouch, I stepped beneath it and went forward to the footlights. The house lights were now on, and the audience was moving into the aisles and slowly up to the exits. The people were obviously puzzled, but they were paying no more attention to the stage.\n\nI looked up at the box. The spotlight had been turned off, and I could see nothing.\n\nA woman screamed once, then again. She was somewhere in the building behind the loges.\n\nI walked quickly into the wings and met Wilson as he was hurrying to the stage to find me. I instructed him to dismantle and crate up the apparatus as quickly as possible. I dashed past him and gained access to the stairs to the balcony and loges. Members of the audience were walking down, and as I started up the stairs, weaving between them.\n\nEvery step I took was harder to complete. My breath was rattling in my throat, and I could feel my heart pounding as if I had just run a mile uphill. I have always kept myself fit, and physical exercise has never been much of a strain for me, but suddenly I felt as if I were weak and overweight. By the time, I was at the top of only the first short flight of steps I could go no further. I rested for a few seconds, then launched myself up the next flight of steps.\n\nI had taken no more than two steps when I had a terrifying cough. My heart was hammering, blood was thumping rhythmically in my ears, sweat was bursting from me. I was unable to stay upright, and I slumped forward across the stone steps, while the last few of the theatregoers went past, their boots only inches from my head.\n\nWilson eventually found me. He raised me into his arms, and held me like a child while I struggled to regain my breath.\n\nAt long last my heart and breathing steadied, and a great chill descended on me.\n\nFinally, I managed to say, \"Did you see what happened\"?\n\n\"Alfred Borden must have got backstage, sir\".\n\n\"Not that! I mean what happened when the power failed\"?\n\n\"I was operating the switching board, Mr Angier. As usual\".\n\nWilson's place during In a Flash is at the back of the stage, invisible to the audience because he is concealed by the backcloth of the screening box. Although he is in touch at every moment with what I am doing, he cannot actually see me for most of the illusion.\n\nI described the ghostly prestige of myself that I had briefly seen. Wilson seemed puzzled, but immediately offered to run up to the loge itself. He did so, while I lay helplessly and uncomfortably on the cold bare steps. When he returned a minute or two later Wilson told me he had seen nothing there.\n\nHe said the seats in the top loge had been scattered across the carpeted floor, but otherwise there was nothing unusual about it. I had to accept what he said; I have learned that Wilson is a sharp and reliable assistant.\n\nHe got me back down the stairs and on the stage again. By this time, I had recovered sufficiently that I could stand unsupported.\n\nI had to put the matter out of my mind. Of much, more pressing concern was the fact that I had suddenly become physically incapacitated. Every move was a strain, and the cough felt explosively coiled in my chest, ready to burst out again at any moment.\n\nWilson hired a cab and returned me safely to my hotel, and at once sent a message to Julia. A doctor was summoned, and when he arrived, he examined me and declared he could find nothing amiss. I had great trouble falling asleep, but I did so in the end.\n\nI awoke this morning feeling stronger and walked downstairs unaided. Wilson was waiting for me in the hotel foyer, with the news that Julia would be arriving at noon. Meanwhile, he declared that I looked unwell, but I insisted I had started to recover. After breakfast, though, I realized I had little strength in me.\n\nReluctantly, I have cancelled both of tonight's performances, and while Wilson has been at the theatre, I have penned this account of what happened.\n\n22nd May 1903.\n\nIn London.\n\nAt Julia's urging, and on Wilson's advice, I have cancelled the remainder of the Lowestoft booking.\n\nDeep in my heart, there is a secret fear. In short, it is that my ill health might mean I shall never again be able to perform. After Borden's attack on me, I have become a semi-invalid.\n\nI have been examined by three doctors. All of them pronounce me well and showing no obvious symptoms of illness. I complain about my breathing, so they listen to my chest and prescribe fresh air. I tell them my heart races when I walk up a flight of stairs, and they listen to my heart and they tell me to be careful about what I eat, and to take things easier. I say that I tire easily, and they advise me to rest.\n\nI weighed myself, with an astonishing result. I have lost nearly thirty pounds in weight! I have weighed more or less exactly one hundred and sixty-eight pounds, for most of my adult years. This morning I found that I weigh just over one hundred and thirty-nine pounds!\n\nIn the mirror, I look the same as ever. I look tired, indeed, but I do not look like someone who cannot climb a short flight of stairs without gasping for breath halfway up.\n\nThere is no normal or logical reason for this; it must have been caused by the incomplete Tesla transmission. The electrical information was only partially sent. Borden's interruption prevented full reassembly.\n\nOnce again, his intervention has taken me to the edge of death!\n\nLater\n\nOn walking, I was seized by an idea, whose consequences I am still thinking through.\n\nIn the confidentiality of these pages let me disclose that whenever I have used the Tesla apparatus, whether it be in performance or rehearsal, I have always made sure to hide two or three gold coins in my pocket. Why I should do so must be self-evident; my recent acquisition of a financial fortune is not solely attributable to performance fees!\n\nTesla, I should in all conscience report, warned me against such an act. He is a highly moral man, and he lectured me long on the subject of forgery. He said he also had scientific reasons, that the apparatus was calibrated for my known body-weight (with certain margins of safety), and that the presence about my person of small but massy objects, such as gold coins, could make the projection inaccurate over longer distances. However, I have never had any of the problems of inaccuracy of which Tesla warned, perhaps because the distances I travel are so short.\n\nThis afternoon I searched for the three coins I had been carrying in my pocket on Tuesday evening. As soon as I held them, I felt certain they weighed less than they did before, and when I weighed them, I discovered they were indeed lighter.\n\nI calculate that they too have lost about seventeen per cent of their mass. They look the same, but they have lost some of their weight.\n\n18th July 1903.\n\nIn Derbyshire.\n\nThe Great Danton is dead. The death of the illusionist Rupert Angier came as a result of injuries sustained when a trick went wrong during a performance at the Pavilion Theatre in Lowestoft. He died at his home in Highgate, London, and leaves a widow and three children.\n\nThe 14th Earl of Colderdale remains alive. He has had the mixed pleasure of reading his own obituary in The Times, a privilege not granted to many.\n\nAngier's affairs are now in the hands of a firm of lawyers. He is of course really dead, and his body was really placed inside the coffin. This I saw as Angier's last illusion: providing his own corpse for burial. Julia is officially his widow, and his children are orphans. They were all present at Highgate Cemetery for his funeral, a ceremony was kept strictly to his immediate family. The press stayed away at the personal request of the widow, and no fans or admirers were seen on the day.\n\nOn that same day, I was myself travelling back anonymously to Derbyshire with Adam Wilson and his family. He and Gertrude have agreed to remain with me as paid companions. I am able to reward them well.\n\nJulia and the children arrived back here three days later. For the time being she is the widow Angier, but as we fade from people's recollections she will quietly become, as is her right, Lady Colderdale.\n\nAfter the disagreeable shock of what happened to me in Lowestoft, I have settled down to what has become my new existence. I am not in decline, and my condition remains stable. I have little physical energy or strength, but I do not seem likely to drop dead suddenly. The doctor here repeats what I was told in London: good food, exercise and a positive outlook will cure me eventually.\n\nI asked Wilson to erect the Tesla apparatus in the basement, telling him that from time to time I shall be rehearsing In a Flash in preparation for my return to the stage. Its real use is, of course, otherwise.\n\n15th December 1903.\n\nAdam Wilson came to my reading room at half past ten this morning, and informed me a visitor was waiting downstairs to see me. It was Arthur Koenig!\n\nI asked Adam to bring him up.\n\nKoenig was in a serious mood. After we had greeted each other, I sat him down in one of the easy chairs facing my desk. The first thing he said was to assure me that his visit was unconnected with his job on the newspaper.\n\n\"I'm here as an emissary, my Lord,\" he said. \"I'm acting in my private capacity for a third party who knows of my interest in the world of magic, and who has asked me to approach your wife\".\n\n\"Approach Julia\"? I said, in genuine surprise. \"Why should you have anything to say to her\"?\n\nKoenig was looking distinctly uncomfortable.\n\n\"Your wife, my Lord, is the widow of Rupert Angier. It is in that guise that I have been commissioned to approach her. But I thought, bearing in mind what has happened in the past, it would be wisest to come to you first\".\n\n\"What's going on, Koenig\"?\n\nHe had brought with him a small leather case, and he now picked this up and laid it on his lap.\n\n\"The... third party for whom I'm acting has come across a notebook, a private memoir, in which it is felt your wife would have an interest. In particular, it is hoped that Lady Colderdale, that is, Mrs Angier, might wish to purchase it. This, er, third party is not aware that you, my Lord, are still alive, and so I find myself not only betraying the person who is sending me on this task, but also the person to whom I should be speaking. But I really felt, under the circumstances-\"\n\n\"Whose notebook is it\"?\n\n\"Alfred Borden's\".\n\n\"Do you have it with you\"?\n\n\"Of course I do\".\n\nKoenig reached down into the case, and produced a cloth-bound notebook of the sort that comes equipped with a lockable clasp. He handed it to me so that I might examine it, but because it was locked, I could not see what was inside. When I looked back at Koenig, he was holding the key. \"My... client requires five hundred pounds, sir\".\n\n\"Is it genuine\"?\n\n\"Most assuredly\".\n\n\"But is it worth five hundred pounds\"?\n\n\"I suspect you will think it worth rather more. It is written in Borden's own hand, and deals directly with the secrets of his magic. The concealment of life as twins is alluded to. I found it a most interesting read, and I can guarantee you will too\".\n\nI turned the book in my hand, wondering about it.\n\n\"Who is your client, Koenig? Who wants the money\"? He looked uneasy, clearly not practised in this sort of thing.\n\n\"My Lord, I suspect you have not heard the main news I am bringing. Are you aware that Borden has recently died\"? No doubt, my startled expression gave him the answer he required. \"To be precise, I believe one of the two brothers is dead\".\n\n\"You sound unsure,\" I said. \"Why\"?\n\n\"Because there's no conclusive proof. You and I both know how obsessively the Bordens concealed their lives, so it's no surprise that the survivor would do the same when the other dies. The trail has been hard to follow\".\n\n\"Then how do you know about it at all? Oh, I see this third party who has commissioned you\".\n\n\"And there is circumstantial evidence\".\n\n\"Such as\"? I prompted.\n\n\"The famous illusion is no longer included in Le Professeur's act\".\n\n\"There could be many reasons for that,\" I observed. \"I've been to his show several times, and he does not always include that trick\".\n\n\"Indeed not. But it would most likely be because both brothers are required to perform it\".\n\n\"I think you should tell me the name of your client, Koenig\".\n\n\"My Lord, I believe you once knew an American woman by the name of Olive Wenscombe\"?\n\nI remembered that Olivia had taken her mother's maiden name when she approached Borden.\n\n\"For reasons you surely appreciate,\" I said, \"I never speak of Miss Svenson\".\n\n\"Yes, yes. And I apologize for mentioning her. However, she is deeply bound up in the matter of the notebook. I understand that Miss Wenscombe, or Svenson, as you knew her, was in your employ some years ago, but she deserted to the Borden camp. For a while, she worked as Borden's stage assistant, but not for long. You lost contact with her, I think, around this time\".\n\nI confirmed that that was so.\n\n\"It turns out,\" Koenig continued, \"that the Borden twins own a secret hideout in North London. To be precise it is a suite of rooms in a well-to-do part of Hornsey, and it is here that one of the brothers lived incognito while the other enjoyed the comforts of home in St Johns Wood. They alternated regularly. After her... leave, Miss Wenscombe was installed in the Hornsey flat, and has been living there ever since. And will go on doing so if the court proceedings against her fail\".\n\n\"Proceedings\"?\n\nI was having trouble taking in all this information at once. Koenig went on, \"She has been served with notice to quit for non-payment of rent, and has to leave the flat next week. As a foreign national with no permanent residence, she would then be faced with deportation. It was for these reasons that she approached me, knowing my interest in Mr Borden. She thought I might be able to help her\".\n\n\"Continue\".\n\n\"You'll be interested to learn that Miss Wenscombe was not aware that there were two brothers, and to this day refuses to believe that she was deceived\".\n\n\"I asked her myself once,\" I said, remembering the grim interview with her in the theatre in Richmond. \"She said then that Borden was just one man. She knew my suspicions. But I can hardly believe that now\".\n\n\"The Borden brother who died was taken ill while in the Hornsey flat. It sounds as if he had a heart attack. Miss Wenscombe summoned Borden's doctor, and after the body had been taken away, the police came round. When she told them who the dead man was, they left to make further enquiries, but never returned. She later contacted the doctor, to discover that he was not available. His assistant told her that Mr Borden had been taken ill, but had recovered quickly and had just been discharged from hospital! As Miss Wenscombe had been with him when he died, she could not believe it! She went to the police again, but to her amazement, they too confirmed it.\n\n\"I heard all this from Miss Wenscombe herself. Now, from what she told me, she has no idea that Borden was maintaining a second household. As far as she was concerned, Borden was with her most days and nights, and she always knew where he was at other times. So then, Borden died suddenly, and she was shocked and upset as anyone in her position would be, but she had no reason to believe there was going to be anything unusual about it! And he certainly died, according to her. She says she was with the body for more than an hour before the doctor arrived, and it had gone cold by then. The doctor examined the body enough to confirm death, and said that he would sign a death certificate on his return to his surgery. Yet now she is faced not only with denials from everyone involved, but also with the incontrovertible fact that Alfred Borden appears on the public stage, performing his magic, and is obviously not dead\".\n\n\"If she thinks that Borden was only one man, how on earth does she account for that\"? I exclaimed.\n\n\"I asked her, of course. As you know, she is no stranger to the world of illusions. She told me that after much thought she came to the sorrowful conclusion that Borden had used magical techniques to fake his death, for instance swallowing some kind of medication, and that it was all an elaborate charade to enable him to walk out on her\".\n\n\"Did you tell her that the Bordens were twins\"?\n\n\"Yes. She scoffed at the idea, and assured me that if a woman lives with a man for five years she knows everything there is to know about him. She absolutely rejected the notion that there might have been two of them\".\n\n\"So this notebook has suddenly appeared, to solve all her problems,\" I said.\n\nKoenig stared at me thoughtfully, then said, \"Not all of them, but her most immediate ones. My Lord, I think that as a gesture of my good faith, I should let you examine the notebook without promise of payment\".\n\nHe passed the key across to me, and sat back in his chair while I opened the lock.\n\nThe notebook was written in a tiny hand, neatly inscribed in regular and even lines, but not at first glance legible. My magician's instinct was telling me to be on my guard against Borden's trickery. All those years of feuding had revealed the extent of his willingness to hurt or harm me. I had turned through about half the thickness of the notebook, when I paused. I stared at it, deep in thought.\n\nIt was more than possible that this was Borden's most elaborate attack on me yet. Koenig's story about Olivia, the death of Borden in her flat, the conveniently revealed existence of a notebook containing Borden's most valuable professional secrets, all these could be fabricated.\n\nI had only Koenig's word to go on. What would the notebook actually contain, if it were another trick? An intricate maze of deceits, which would manipulate me into some, misguided response? Could there be something here that would, through the person of Olivia Svenson, threaten my one remaining area of stability, namely my miraculously restored marriage to Julia?\n\nIt seemed to me that I was putting myself in hazard, even to hold the notebook.\n\nKoenig's voice interrupted my thoughts.\n\n\"Dare I presume, my Lord, that I can guess what is going through your mind\"?\n\n\"No, you may not so presume,\" I said.\n\n\"You are doubting me,\" Koenig persisted. \"You think that Borden has paid me, or pressed me in some way, to bring this to you. Is that so\"? I made no answer, still holding the notebook half open, with my eyes staring down at it.\n\n\"There are ways you could investigate what I am telling you,\" Koenig went on. \"A court action against Miss Wenscombe by the landlord of the apartment in Hornsey was heard at Hampstead Assizes a month ago. You could examine the court records for yourself. There are almoner's records at the Whittington Hospital, where an unidentified victim of a heart attack, with age and physical appearance matching that of Borden, was brought in on the day Miss Wenscombe says he died. There is also a record that that corpse was removed by a local doctor on the same day\".\n\n\"Koenig, you sent me on a trail of false evidence ten years ago,\" I said.\n\n\"I did indeed. I have never ceased to regret it, and have already told you that my dedication to your cause is the result of that error. I give you my word that the notebook is genuine, that the circumstances of it coming into my possession are as I have described, and that furthermore the surviving Borden brother is desperate to regain it\".\n\n\"How has it escaped him\"? I said.\n\n\"Miss Wenscombe realized its potential value, perhaps as something that might be published as a book. When her need for money became urgent, she thought it might be more valuable to you or, as she understood recent events, to your widow. Naturally, she kept the notebook hidden. Borden himself cannot approach her for it, but it surely is not a coincidence that ten days ago her flat was forcibly entered and the place ransacked. Nothing was taken. This notebook, which she had secreted elsewhere, remained in her possession\".\n\nI opened the notebook where my finger had come to rest. It was as if Borden had forced the page on me.\n\nThe rest of the sentence said: \"This is the real reason Angier will never solve the whole mystery, unless I myself give him the answer\".\n\n\"She wants five hundred pounds, you say\"?\n\n\"Yes, my Lord\".\n\n\"She shall have it\".\n\n19th December 1903.\n\nKoenig's visit exhausted me, and soon after he left (with six hundred pounds, the surplus was partly for his trouble to date, and partly for his silence and absence henceforth) I took to my bed where I remained until the evening. I wrote up my account of it then, but the next day and the day after I was too weak to attempt more than a little eating and a lot of sleeping.\n\nYesterday I was able at last to read some of Borden's notebook. As Koenig had predicted, I found it an interesting read.\n\nI have been showing extracts to Julia, who finds it equally interesting. She reacts more against his self-satisfied tone than I do, and urges me not to burn up any of my precious energy by getting angry with him again.\n\nWhat is most fascinating to me is that at last I have proof that Alfred Borden was the product of a conspiracy between twins. Nowhere they admit it, but the notebook is clearly the work of two hands.\n\nThey address each other in the first person singular. I found this confusing at first, as perhaps was intended, but when I pointed it out to Julia she observed that the notebook was apparently not intended to be read by anyone else.\n\nIt suggests that they call each other \"me\" by habit, and this in turn implies they have done it for most of their lives. Reading between the lines of the notebook, as I must, I realize that every event or happening in their lives has been one collective experience. It is as if they spent their lives from childhood preparing for the illusion where one would secretly take the place of the other. It fooled me, and fooled most of the audiences who saw them in performance, but surely, in the end it is Borden who is the fool.\n\nTwo lives made into one means a halving of those lives. While one lives in the world, the other hides, literally non-existent, a lurking spirit, a prestige.\n\n26th March 1904.\n\nI have been seriously ill. The symptoms have been horrific: persistent nausea and vomiting, paralysis of my right leg, an ulcerated mouth, and an almost uncontainable pain from my lower back. Needless to say, I have been confined in a hospital in Sheffield for much of the time.\n\nNow, though, a minor miracle has occurred and I find myself apparently on the mend. The ulcers have cleared up leaving no trace, I am getting some feeling and therefore movement in my leg and the general sense of pain and illness is receding. I have been at home for the last week, and although I have been bedridden, my spirits have risen a little more every day.\n\nToday I am out of bed. I am in the best of spirits, and I am re-reading Borden's notebook. These last two facts are not unconnected.\n\n6th April 1904.\n\nI have read Borden's notes a total of three times, and have annotated and cross-referenced them in detail. Julia is about to prepare a fair copy of my edited and greatly expanded text.\n\nAlthough the remission from my ailments continues, and for the last few days I have continued to feel better, I must face up to the fact that overall my health is declining. I therefore confess that in these terminal months of my life I am intending to take a last revenge on my enemy. He it was who caused this condition, he it is who must pay. Acquisition of his notebook has given me a way. I am planning to arrange for it to be published.\n\nWhile I was reading Borden's notebook it frequently occurred to me that it deserved to be published for the benefit of his fellow magicians. It contains much sensible comment on the art and technique of magic.\n\nI see it as my last act to arrange publication on his behalf, and when I have completed my annotated edition, I shall see to it.\n\nIf he survives me, which is likely, he will discover that my revenge is subtle and many-layered.\n\nFor a start, Borden will be appalled to discover, as he soon will, that what he sees as his greatest professional secrets have been published without his permission. His humiliation will be the deeper when he realizes that I was responsible. He will be baffled when he works out that somehow I was able to do this from beyond the grave.\n\nIn short, I have improved his text by making it less obscure, by expanding on many of the interesting general topics, which he merely mentions, by illustrating his absorbing theory of agreement with numerous examples, by describing the methods of many of the great illusionists. I have added detailed descriptions of every trick I know him to have invented, as well as those others I know him to be capable of performing, and in each case have seemed to explain each one without actually revealing the central secret.\n\nAbove all, I have heightened the mystery surrounding the illusion he calls The New Transported Man, but have given nothing away. The fact that the Bordens were identical twins is not even hinted at. The secret that obsessed these two men's lives remains a secret.\n\nThe surviving Borden will therefore realize that I had the last word, that the feud is over and that I triumphed. While invading his privacy I showed I could respect it. From this, I hope he will learn that the enmity he fostered between us was destructive, that while we sniped at each other we were wasting the talents in us both. We should have been friends.\n\nI will leave him this so that he may reflect on it for the remainder of his life.\n\nAnd there is one extra revenge, by omission; he will never discover the secret of Tesla's apparatus.\n\n18th May 1904.\n\nWith the work complete, we have submitted the manuscript to a publisher.\n\n2nd July 1904.\n\nI have agreed a publishing deal with Messrs Goodwin and Andrewson, of Old Bailey, London EC.\n\nThey will publish Borden's book before the end of this year, in an edition of seventy-five copies, at a price of three guineas each. They promise abundant illustration and intensive advertisement by personal letter to their regular clientele.\n\n4th July 1904.\n\nOver the last four weeks, my remission has ended, and the earlier illness has returned in force. First came the ulceration of mouth and throat. Three weeks ago I became blind in one eye; the other followed a day or two later. For the last week, I have been unable to keep down solid food, but Julia brings me a mild broth three times a day and that is keeping me alive. I am in such pain that I cannot raise my head from the pillow. The doctor calls twice daily, but says that I am too weak to be transferred to hospital. My symptoms are so distressing that I am unable describe them in detail, but the doctor explains that for some reason all my body's natural immunity to infection has been damaged.\n\n5th July 1904.\n\nI had an uncomfortable night, and as dawn broke this morning, I believed that I had reached my last day on this earth. It is, however, now approaching midnight and I am still alive.\n\nI started to cough early this evening, and the doctor came directly to see me. He suggested bathing with cool towels, and they have helped make me more comfortable. I am unable to move any part of my body.\n\n6th July 1904.\n\nAt a quarter to three this morning my life was brought to its end by a sudden seizure of the heart, following a spasm of coughing and consequent internal bleeding.\n\nMy dying was painful, messy and profoundly distressing to Julia and my children, as well as to myself.\n\nDeath uniquely surrounds my life!\n\nOnce, in harmless deception, I pretended to die so that Julia might live without scandal as a widow. Every use of the Tesla apparatus later brought death to my experience, several times a week. When Rupert Angier was laid falsely to rest, I was alive to bear witness to it.\n\nI have cheated death many times. Death has therefore acquired a sense of unreality for me. It has come to be a commonplace event that by some paradox, it seems, I can always survive.\n\nNow I have seen myself on my deathbed, dying of multiple cancers, and afterwards, after that dreadful and painful death, I am here to report it in my diary. Wednesday, 6th July 1904: the day I died.\n\nNo man should be so miserable as to have to see what I have seen.\n\nLater\n\nI have borrowed a technique from Borden, so that I am I as well as myself. I who write this am not the same as the I who died. We became two beings that night in Lowestoft, when Borden caused the malfunctioning of the Tesla apparatus. We went our separate ways. We have been together again since I returned to Caldlow House at the end of March, just as my temporary remission from the cancers began.\n\nWhile I yet lived, I maintained the illusion that I was one. One of me lay dying, while the other of me recorded my final concerns. All entries in this journal since 26th March have been written by me.\n\nWe are each the prestige of the other.\n\nMy dead prestige lies downstairs in his open casket, and will be placed in the family vault in two days' time. I, his living prestige, continue onward.\n\nI am the Right Honourable Rupert David Angier, 14th Earl of Colderdale, husband to Julia, father to Edward, Lydia and Florence, Lord of Caldlow House in the County of Derbyshire, England.\n\nI shall narrate my story tomorrow. The events of the day have left me, like everyone else in the household, too unhappy for anything but sadness.\n\n7th My 1904.\n\nThe remainder of my life begins on this day. What hopes can be entertained by one such as I! The following is my story.\n\nCHAPTER ONE.\n\nI came into being on the evening of 19th May 1903, in an unoccupied loge in the Pavilion Theatre in Lowestoft. My life began as I balanced on the wooden rail, from which I promptly fell backwards. I crashed to the floor of the loge, scattering the chairs. A thought had sprung into my mind an instant before: Borden had somehow found his way up to the loge and was waiting for me. Clearly not! Trying to orientate myself physically, I realized that although Borden had sabotaged the apparatus in some way, the transportation was completed.\n\nBright light flooded into the loge, as the spot was turned on it. No more than two or three seconds had elapsed. I thought: there is still a chance to save the illusion! I can crawl back to the rail, make something of it!\n\nI was about to climb up to the rail when, to my amazement, I heard a voice on the stage calling for the curtain to be rung down. I moved forward, keeping my head down, and peered down at the stage. Before the curtain blocked my view, I briefly saw myself, my prestige, immobile on the stage.\n\nThere is a compartment built into the base of the Tesla apparatus into which the prestige automatically falls as the transformation takes place. My old body, the prestige, is therefore concealed from the audience in order to give maximum impact to the illusion.\n\nThis time, Borden's intervention must have prevented the compartment from functioning, leaving the prestige in full view!\n\nI thought quickly. Adam Wilson and Hester were both backstage, and dealt with the emergency there behind the curtain. I was alive, strong and in full possession of my senses.\n\nI realized it was my responsibility to get to the backstage area, and confront Borden once and for all.\n\nI let myself out of the loge, hurried along the corridor, then took the stairs at a run. I passed one of the female attendants. I stopped in front of her, and said, \"Have you seen anyone trying to leave the theatre\"?\n\nMy voice came out as a harsh whisper!\n\nThe woman, staring straight at me, screamed in horror. I stood there helplessly for a moment, deafened by her terrible yell. I realized I was wasting time, so I laid my hand on her arm to push her gently to one side. My hand sank into the flesh of her arm!\n\nShe had collapsed on the steps, shuddering and moaning, as I reached the bottom of the stairs and found the door to the backstage area. I shoved it open, and again I felt my hands and arms pushing into the wood. I had to find Borden, and had no time to pay much attention.\n\nWithout noticing me, Adam Wilson ran past from his position; I called after him but he heard me no more than he had seen me. I paused for a moment, trying to think clearly about Borden's location. He had somehow interrupted the supply of electricity to the apparatus, and this could only mean that he had gained access to the sub-stage mezzanine.\n\nI found the stairs leading down, but as I went on to the top step, I heard the sound of feet running heavily towards me, and in a moment, Borden himself appeared. I froze. When he was no more than five feet away from me he looked up to see where he was going. He saw me instead! Once again, I witnessed the look of terror that had distorted the features of the female attendant. Borden stretched out his arms defensively in front of him. Almost at once, we collided.\n\nWe fell heavily on the stone floor of the corridor. He was briefly on top of me, but I was able to slide out. I reached towards him.\n\n\"Stay away from me\"! he cried, and crouching forward, stumbling, he scrambled away.\n\nI jumped at him, got my hand around his ankle, but he slipped it from my grasp.\n\nI shouted at him, \"Borden, we must stop this dangerous feud\"!, but once again my voice came out hoarsely and inaudibly, more breath than tone.\n\n\"I didn't mean it\"! he cried.\n\nHe was on his feet now and getting away from me, still looking back at me with an expression of dread. I gave up the struggle, and let him flee.\n\nCHAPTER TWO.\n\nAfter that night, I returned to London, where I lived for the next ten months, by my own choice and decision, in a half-world.\n\nThe accident in the Tesla apparatus had fundamentally affected my body and soul by placing them in opposition to each other. Physically, I had become a ghost of my former self. I lived, breathed, ate, passed bodily waste, heard and saw, felt warm and cold, but I was physically a ghost. In a bright light, if you did not look too closely at me, I appeared more or less normal. When the weather was overcast, or I was in an artificially lit room after nightfall, I could be seen but also seen through. My outline remained, and if people looked hard enough at me, they could make out my face, my clothes, and so on, but I was to most people a hideous vision of the ghostly underworld. The female attendant and Borden had both reacted as if they had seen a ghost, and indeed, they had. I quickly learned that if I let myself be noticed in these circumstances, I not only terrorized most of the people whom I encountered, but I put myself in some danger too. People react unpredictably when frightened. As a rule, I therefore stayed out of sight when I could.\n\nBut at the same time, my mind suddenly felt liberated from the constraints of the body: I became alert and fast thinking. One of the paradoxes this produced was that I usually felt strong and capable, whereas the reality was that I was unable to do most physical tasks. I had to learn to hold objects like pens and utensils, for example, because a careless grip on something would usually make it slip away from me.\n\nI found myself in a frustrating situation, and for much of the time my new mental energy was directed as pure hate and fear at the Borden who had attacked me. He continued to sap my mental energy, just as his action had sapped my physical being. I had become invisible to the world, as good as dead.\n\nCHAPTER THREE.\n\nSoon I discovered that I could be visible or invisible as I chose.\n\nIf I moved after dusk, and I wore the stage clothes I had been in during the performance, I could go almost anywhere unseen. If I wanted to move normally then I wore other clothes, and used greasepaint to give my features some solidity though it was not a perfect simulation. Money, food, accommodation presented no problems to me. Either I took what I wanted when in the invisible state, or I paid for what I needed. Such concerns were trivial.\n\nMy real consideration was the well-being of my prestige.\n\nI learned from a newspaper report that The Great Danton had suffered injuries during a performance in Lowestoft, that he had been forced to cancel future engagements, but was resting at home and expected to return to the stage.\n\nI was relieved to hear it, but greatly surprised! What I had glimpsed as the curtain came down was what I assumed was my own prestige, frozen in the half-dead, half-live condition I called \"prestigious\". The prestige is the source body in the transportation, left behind in the Tesla apparatus, as if dead. Concealing and disposing of these prestigious bodies was the single greatest problem I had had to solve before I could present the illusion to the public.\n\nWith this news, about ill health and cancelled engagements I realized something different had happened that night. The transportation had been only partial, and I was the sorry result. Most of me had remained behind.\n\nBoth I and my prestige were much reduced by Borden's intervention. We each had problems. I was in a ghostlike condition, my prestige was in ill health. From the moment of the accident, he was doomed to die; meanwhile, I had been condemned to a life in the shadows, but my health was intact.\n\nIn July, two months after Lowestoft, my prestige apparently decided of his own accord to bring forward the death of Rupert Angier. It was exactly what I would have done in his position; the moment I thought this, I realized that he was me. It was the first time we had reached an identical decision separately, and my first suggestion that although we existed separately we were emotionally but one person.\n\nSoon after, my prestige returned to Caldlow House to take up the inheritance; again, this is what I would have done.\n\nI, though, remained in London for the time being. I had macabre business to attend to, and I wanted to conduct it in secret with no risk of what I intended to do attaching itself to the Colderdale name.\n\nIn short, I had decided that Borden, finally, must die. I planned to murder him, or, more exactly, to murder one of the two. His secret double life made murder a revenge: he had interfered with the official records that revealed the existence of twins, and had lived his life with one-half of himself concealed. Killing one of the brothers would put an end to his deception, and would be as satisfying and effective as killing them both. I also reasoned that in my ghostlike state, and with my only known identity publicly buried and mourned, I, Rupert Angier, could never be caught or even suspected of the crime.\n\nIn London, I set my plans in progress. I was able to use my virtual invisibility to follow Borden as he went about his life and affairs. I saw him in his family home, I saw him preparing and rehearsing his stage show in his workshop, I stood unseen in the wings of a theatre as he performed his illusions, I tracked him to the secret place he shared in north London with Olivia Svenson... and once, even, I glimpsed Borden with his twin brother, briefly meeting in a darkened street, a hurried exchange of information, some desperate business that had to be concluded at once and in person.\n\nIt was when I saw him with Olivia that I decided, finally, he must die. Enough feelings remained about that old betrayal to add hurt to the outrage.\n\nThe mere thought of killing gave me such satisfaction and excitement that my personality changed. I, who was beyond death, lived to kill.\n\nOnce I had taken the decision, commission of the crime could not be made to wait. I saw the death of one of the Borden twins as the key to my own freedom.\n\nBut I had no experience of violence, and before I could do anything I had to decide how best to go about it. I decided I would have to stab him. I found, by experiment, that if I held a long-bladed knife in both hands, firmly but not tightly, then I could slide it with sufficient force to penetrate flesh.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR.\n\nTwo days after I had completed my preparations I followed Borden to the Queen's Theatre in Baiham, where he was top of a variety bill running all week. On that day, there was a matinee performance as well as one in the evening. I knew it was Borden's habit to retire to his dressing room between shows for a nap on his couch.\n\nI watched his performance from the darkened wings, then afterwards followed him to his dressing-room. When he was inside with the door closed, I went to where I had secreted my murder weapon and returned cautiously to the corridor outside Borden's room.\n\nI was wearing the stage clothes from Lowestoft, my habitual clothing when I wished to move unobserved, but the knife was a normal one. If I had been seen by anyone, it would have looked as if the knife were floating along unsupported in the air; I could not risk having attention drawn to me.\n\nAfter another check that no one was approaching, I went to the door and leaned against it, pressing my face gently but firmly into the wood. In a few seconds, the front part of my head had passed through, and I was able to see into the room. Borden was lying on his couch, with his eyes closed, and his hands clasped together on his chest.\n\nI withdrew my face.\n\nClasping the knife, I opened the door and went inside. Borden stirred, and looked towards me.\n\n\"Who's that\"? Borden said, narrowing his eyes.\n\nI took two steps across the narrow floor, then leaped up on to the couch and crawled on top of him. I squatted on his stomach, and raised the knife in both hands.\n\nBorden saw the knife, then focused on me. In the dim light, I was just visible. I must have been a wild and dreadful sight; I had been unable to shave or cut my hair for more than two months, and my face was skinny. I was sitting on his abdomen. I was holding a knife, preparing for the deadly thrust.\n\n\"What are you\"? Borden gasped. He had taken hold of my ghostly wrists, trying to hold me back, but it was a simple matter to work myself free of him. \"Who-\"?\n\n\"Prepare to die, Borden\"! I shouted, knowing that what he would hear was the hoarse and horrifying whisper that was all I was capable of producing.\n\n\"Angier? Please! I had no idea what I was doing! I meant no harm\"!\n\n\"Was it you who did it? Or was it the other\"?\n\n\"What do you mean\"?\n\n\"Was it you or your twin brother\"?\n\n\"I have no brother\"!\n\n\"You are about to die! Admit the truth\"!\n\n\"I am alone\"!\n\n\"Too late\"! I shouted, and I deliberately set my hands in the grip I had learned would give me the strongest grasp on the knife. I would lose the hold if I stabbed too savagely, so I brought the blade down to a place above his heart and began the steady pressure I knew would take the blade through to its target. I felt the fabric of his shirt slit open, and the knifepoint pressed down into his flesh.\n\nThen I saw the expression on Borden's face. He was full of fear. His hands were somewhere above my head, trying to get a grip on me. His jaw had fallen open, and his tongue was jutting forward. His chest was convulsing with his frantic breathing.\n\nNo words came out of his mouth, but he was trying to speak. I heard the hiss of a man drowning in his own terror.\n\nI realized that he was not a strong man any more. His hair was going grey. The skin around his eyes was wrinkled with fatigue. His neck was lined. He lay beneath me, fighting for his life against an insubstantial daemon who had come to squat on his body with a knife ready to slay him.\n\nThe thought repulsed me. I could not kill like this. All the fear, anger and tension poured away from me. I threw the knife aside, and rolled off. I backed away from him.\n\nHe remained on the couch, where he was shuddering with horror and relief. I stood, mortified by the effect I had had on this man.\n\nFinally, he steadied.\n\n\"Who are you\"? he said, and his frightened voice was uneven, breaking into falsetto on the last word.\n\n\"I am Rupert Angier,\" I replied hoarsely.\n\n\"But you are dead\"!\n\n\"Yes\".\n\n\"Then how-\"?\n\nI said, \"We should never have started this, Borden. But killing you is not the way to end it\".\n\nI was humbled by the awfulness what I had been trying to do. How could I ever have imagined that I could kill a man? I turned away from Borden sorrowfully, and forced myself against the wooden door.\n\nCHAPTER FIVE.\n\nI was thrown into a fit of despair and self-disgust by my attempt on Borden's life. I knew I had betrayed myself, betrayed my prestige (who was aware of none of my actions), betrayed Julia, my children, my father's name, every friend I had known. If ever I needed proof that my feud with Borden was an appalling mistake, at last I had it.\n\nIn a state of apathy I returned to the room I had rented, thinking there was no more I could do with my life. I had nothing more for which to live.\n\nCHAPTER SIX.\n\nI planned to waste away and die, but there is a spirit of life, even in one such as myself, that stands in the way of such decisions. I thought that if I did not eat and drink then death would simply follow, but I found that I was not able to resist thirst and hunger.\n\nI went through most of the winter in a miserable state, a failure even at self-destruction.\n\nIt was when I thought of the life of my other self, the prestige left behind me after Lowestoft, that I felt a sense of sharp focus. I knew at once he was in trouble. Once again, when I thought specifically about his health, I knew at once I had identified what was happening. He was ill, dying even. I had to be with him, help him in whatever way I could.\n\nBy this time, I was myself no great figure of physical strength. My poor diet and lack of exercise had made me into a virtual skeleton.\n\nI therefore decided to improve my appearance. I began to take food and drink in reasonable quantities, I cut my long hair, and stole a new set of clothes. Several weeks of care would be necessary to restore me even to my appearance after Lowestoft, but I did start feeling better almost at once, and my spirits rose.\n\nIn the last week of March, I bought a ticket for the overnight train to Sheffield.\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\n\nI knew that my sudden appearance would not surprise the part of me that I called my prestige.\n\nAt the house, I went and hammered on the door. I could have let myself in, but I had no idea what I should expect to find. I felt it best to take my unheralded return one-step at a time.\n\nHutton opened the door. I removed my hat, and stood plainly before him. He stared wordlessly, and his face was impassive. I knew him well enough to realize that his silence revealed his dismay.\n\nWhen I had given him time to accept who I might be, I said, \"Hutton, I'm pleased to see you again\".\n\nHe opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came.\n\n\"You must know what occurred in Lowestoft, Hutton,\" I said. \"I am the unfortunate consequence of that\".\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he said at last.\n\n\"May I come in\"?\n\n\"Should I say to Lady Colderdale you are here, sir\"?\n\n\"I should like to speak to you quietly before I see her, Hutton. I know my arrival here is likely to cause alarm\".\n\nHe took me to his sitting room beside the kitchen, and he gave me a cup of tea. I sipped it while I stood before him, not knowing how to explain. Hutton, a man I had always admired for his presence of mind, soon took control of the situation.\n\n\"I think it best, sir,\" he said, \"if you would wait here while I announce your arrival to her ladyship. She will then, I believe, come to see you. You may best decide how to proceed together\".\n\n\"Hutton, tell me. How is my-? I mean, how is the health of-'?\n\n\"His lordship has been seriously ill, sir. However, the prognosis is excellent and he has returned this week from hospital. He is recovering in the garden room, where we have moved his bed. I believe her ladyship is with him at this moment\".\n\n\"This is an impossible situation, Hutton,\" I said.\n\n\"It is, sir\".\n\n\"For you in particular, I mean\".\n\n\"For me and for you, and for everyone, sir. I understand what happened in that theatre in Lowestoft. His lordship, that is, you, sir, took me into his confidence. You will remember, no doubt, that I have been much involved with the disposal of the prestige materials. There are of course no secrets in this house, my Lord, as you directed\".\n\n\"Is Adam Wilson here\"?\n\n\"Yes, he is\".\n\n\"I'm glad to know that\".\n\nA few moments later, Hutton left and five minutes later returned with Julia. She looked tired. She came straight to me and we embraced warmly enough, but we were both so nervous. I could feel her tensing as we held each other.\n\nHutton excused himself, and when we were left alone.\n\nI explained to Julia the limits of my bodily existence; how I would fade from sight without bright light, how I could slip through solid objects.\n\nThen she told me of the cancers from which I, my prestige, had been suffering, and how by some miracle they had seemed to recede on their own, allowing me, him, to return home.\n\n\"Will he recover completely\"? I asked anxiously.\n\n\"The surgeon said that recovery sometimes occurs spontaneously, but in most cases a remission is only for a short while. He believes in this case, you, he -\" She looked ready to cry, so I took her hand in mine. She steadied herself and spoke sadly. \"He believes that this is just a temporary state. The cancers are widespread\".\n\nThen she told me the matters that most surprised me: that Borden, or more accurately one of the Borden twins, had died, and that his notebook had come into my, our, possession.\n\nI was astounded to hear these things. For instance, I learned that Borden had died only three days after my failed attempt on his life; the two events seemed to me inevitably connected. Julia said he had suffered a heart attack; I wondered if this could have been caused by the fear I rose in him? I remembered his terrible noises of anguish, his laboured breathing, and his general appearance of fatigue and ill health. I knew that heart seizures could be caused by stress, but until this moment, I had supposed that after my departure Borden regained his senses and would eventually have returned to normal.\n\nI confessed my story to Julia, but she seemed to think the two events were unconnected.\n\nEven more of interest was the news about Borden's notebook. I asked her if I, my prestige, had any plans about what to do with it, but she said that the illness had interrupted everything. She mentioned that she shared some of the remorse I felt towards Borden, and that my prestige was of much the same mind.\n\nI said, \"Where is he? We must be together\".\n\n\"He will be waking soon,\" Julia replied.\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\n\nMy reunion with myself must be one of the most unusual in history! He and I were perfect complements to each other. Everything I lacked was in him; everything I had he had lost. Of course, we were the same, closer to each other than identical twins.\n\nWhen either of us spoke, the other could easily finish the sentence. We moved in the same way, had the same gestures and mannerisms, came to the same thought in the same moment. I knew everything about him, and he knew the same of me. All we lacked between ourselves was our separate experiences of the last few months, but once we had described these to each other, even that difference was eliminated.\n\nOnce we were together, there was nothing that would make us separate again. I asked Hutton to make up a second bed in the garden room, so that the two halves of myself could be together the whole time.\n\nNone of this could be kept from the rest of the household, and soon I was reunited with my children, with Adam and Gertrude Wilson, as well as Mrs Hutton, the housekeeper. Everyone exclaimed about the uncanny double effect we created. I dread to think what effect this revelation of their father will have on my children in the future, but both parts of me, and Julia, agreed that the truth was better than yet another lie.\n\nSoon the chilling fact of the cancers made us realize that if there was anything remaining to be done, now was the time.\n\nCHAPTER NINE.\n\nFrom the beginning of April until the middle of May, we worked together on the revision of Borden's notebook, preparing it for the publisher. My twin brother (for so it became convenient to think of my prestige) was soon ill again, and although he had done much of the initial work on the book, it was I who completed the work, and negotiated with the publisher.\n\nAnd I, using his identity, maintained the journal for him until his death. So it was yesterday, that our double life came to an end, and with it comes the end of my own short life story. Now there is only me, and I live beyond death once more.\n\n8th July 1904.\n\nThis morning I went with Wilson down to the cellar, where we inspected the Tesla apparatus. It was in full working order.\n\nWilson asked me if we should dismantle the device.\n\nI thought briefly, then said, \"Let's leave it until after the funeral\".\n\nThe ceremony is planned for tomorrow at midday.\n\nAfter Wilson had left, and I had locked the access door to the cellar, I powered up the device and used it to transmit more gold coins. I was thinking of the future, of my son the 15th Earl, of my wife the widow.\n\nI had not counted the wealth we had created with the device, but my prestige had shown me the store he had made, kept in a closed and locked compartment in the darkest recess of the cellar. I removed what I estimated to be two thousand pounds' worth, for Julia's immediate requirements, then I added my few new coins to what was left.\n\nHowever, I would see to it that the Tesla device remained intact. Alley's instructions would be kept with it. One day, Edward will find this journal and realize what the apparatus can best be used for.\n\nLater.\n\nI have only a few hours left before the funeral, and cannot spend too much of that time writing in these pages. Therefore, let me note the following.\n\nIt is eight in the evening, and I am in the garden room I shared with my prestige before he died. A few minutes ago, I walked softly around the grounds of the house, breathing the summer scents, listening to the quiet sounds of this moorland country I loved so much during my childhood.\n\nIt is a fine warm evening in which to plan the end, the very end.\n\nLife has become not worth living. All that I love is forbidden to me by the state I am in. My family accepts me. They know who I am and what I am, and that my circumstances are not of my own making. Even so, the man they loved is dead, and I cannot replace him. Better for them that I depart, so that they might at last start to grieve fully and freely for the man who died. In the expression of grief lies recovery from grief itself.\n\nNor have I any legal existence: Rupert Angier the magician is dead and buried, the 14th Earl of Colderdale will be buried tomorrow.\n\nMy only expectation of life is as a ghost of myself.\n\nSo now, it must end, and I shall die.\n\nBut the curse of life also clings to me! I have already found how fierce the spirit of life burns in me, and that not only is murder ethically beyond me but suicide too is an impossibility for me. I can make myself die only by convincing myself that there is also a hope I shall not succeed.\n\nAs soon as I have completed these notes, I will conceal this journal, and the earlier volumes of it, somewhere amongst the prestige's which lie in the vault. Then I will unlock the compartment in the cellar, leaving the gold for my son or his son eventually to find. This journal must not be discovered while the gold is yet to be spent, because I have confessed of the forgery.\n\nWith all this completed I will charge up the Tesla device again and use it for the last time.\n\nI have spent the last hour measuring and checking the coordinates, preparing myself, rehearsing as if an audience of thousands will be watching. But this act of magic must take place while I am alone, because I shall project myself into the deceased body of my prestige, and there my end will come!\n\nI shall arrive there; of this, there is no doubt, because the Tesla apparatus has never faltered yet in its accuracy. But what will be the result of this morbid union?\n\nIf it is a failure, I shall materialize inside my prestige's poor, cancer-ridden body, dead for two days. I too will be instantly dead, and will know nothing about it. Tomorrow, as they lay the body to rest they will lay me with it.\n\nBut I believe there is a chance of another outcome, one that acknowledges my desperation to live. This materialization might not succeed in killing me!\n\nI am certain, almost certain, that my arrival in the body of my prestige will return life to it. It will be a reunion, a final joining. I have the spirit that he never had. I will reanimate his body with my spirit. I have the will to live that was taken from him; I will restore it to him. I have the vital spark that now he lacks. I will heal his body with my purity of health, will pump blood once more through his arteries and veins.\n\nIs it madness to think such a thing might be possible?\n\nI am mad enough, while I yet plan, to believe there is hope. That hope allows me to press ahead.\n\nThe mad reanimated body of my prestige will rise from its open casket, and be quickly gone from this house. Everything that has become forbidden to me will be left behind. I have loved this life, and have loved others while in it, but because my only remaining hope of life is an act that every sane person would find disgraceful, I must become an outcast, leave behind all those I have loved, go out into the world, make what I can of what I find.\n\nNow I shall do it!\n\nI will go alone to the end.\n\nPART FIVE.\n\nTHE PRESTIGES.\n\nCHAPTER ONE.\n\nMy brother's voice was speaking ceaselessly to me: lam here, don't leave, stay with me, come.\n\nI had to get out of bed. I put on my clothes quickly, grabbed my stuff and went downstairs. I looked at my watch. It was after 2 00 am.\n\nMy brother said: all right, now.\n\nKate was still in the dining room, sitting awake in her chair next to the fire. She was listening to a portable radio. She seemed unsurprised to see me.\n\n\"I was cold,\" I said. \"I couldn't get to sleep. Anyway, I've got to go and find him\".\n\n\"It's much colder out there\". She indicated the blackness beyond the windows. \"You'll need all this\".\n\nOn the chair opposite her, she had placed several items of warm clothing, including a wool sweater, a thick overcoat, scarf, gloves, a pair of rubber boots. And two large torches.\n\nMy brother spoke again. I could not ignore him.\n\nI said to Kate, \"You knew I was going to do this\".\n\n\"Yes. I've been thinking\".\n\n\"Do you know what's happening to me\"?\n\n\"I believe so. You'll have to go and find him\".\n\n\"Will you come with me\"?\n\nShe shook her head. \"No way on earth\".\n\n\"So you know where he is\"?\n\n\"I think I've known all my life, but it's always been easier to put it out of my mind. The difficult thing about meeting you has been realizing that what traumatized me as a child is still down there\".\n\nIt had stopped snowing, but the wind was freezing. In the centre of the garden, the snow was shallow enough to allow me to walk through.\n\nKate had switched on the intruder alarm, which flooded the area with brilliant light. It helped me see my way.\n\nMy brother said: I'm cold, waiting.\n\nI kept going. I saw the brick-built archway where Kate had said it would be. Snow was piled up against the base of it.\n\nThe door was not locked, and it moved easily when I pulled at the handle. The door opened outwards, against the drifted snow, and once I got a good hold on it, I was able to push the snow far enough out of the way for me to squeeze through.\n\nI peered inside, letting the beam of the bigger of the two torches play ahead of me. There was nothing much to see: a rocky roof slanting down, some steps and at the bottom a second door.\n\nThe word Yes formed, inside my head.\n\nThe second door had no lock, and opened smoothly at my touch. The beams of my torches swung around; one in my hand searched all about, the other tucked under my arm followed my direction of sight.\n\nThen my foot collided with something hard that jutted up from the floor and I stumbled. The torch under my arm broke as I banged against the rocky wall. Crouching on the ground, resting on a knee, I used one torch to examine the other.\n\nThere's a light, said my brother.\n\nI swung the single torch beam around again, and at shoulder height, I noticed an ordinary light switch. I flicked it on. At first, nothing happened.\n\nThen, further, down in the cavern, deep inside the hill, I heard the sound of an engine. As the generator picked up speed, lights came on for the full length of the cavern. They were only low-power light bulbs, attached to the rocky ceiling, but there was now enough light to see without the torch.\n\nThe cavern was a natural fissure in the rock, with extra tunnelling. The air was surprisingly sweet, and noticeably warmer than outside.\n\nI went several paces down the cavern, balancing myself with my hands against the rocky walls on each side. After a distance of about fifty yards, the floor dropped steeply and turned to the right, while to the left of the main tunnel I noticed a large cavity which to judge by the roundness of the entrance had been hollowed out artificially. The opening was not electrically lit, so I shone my remaining torch inside.\n\nI immediately wished I had not. It was full of ancient coffins. Most were stacked horizontally in heaps, although about a dozen were leaning upright against the walls. They were all sizes. All the coffins were in varying degrees of decay. At the base of most of the heaps were piles of brown, broken fragments, presumably of bone.\n\nI stepped back quickly into the main tunnel and glanced up towards the door by which I had entered. There had been a slight curve, and my way out was now invisible to me. Somewhere deep inside the cavern, the generator continued to run.\n\nI was trembling. But I could not go back. My brother was here.\n\nDetermined to resolve this quickly, I followed the path down and to the right. Another flight of steps followed.\n\nSupporting myself with my hand on the wall, I went down them. The tunnel immediately opened out into a wider cavern.\n\nIt was full of modern metal racks, brown-painted, held together with chromium-plated bolts. Each rack had three broad shelves, one on top of the other. A narrow aisle ran next to each rack, and a central aisle ran the whole length of the hall. A light was positioned above every aisle between the shelves, illuminating what they held.\n\nCHAPTER TWO.\n\nHuman bodies lay uncovered on every shelf of the racks. Each one was male, and fully clothed. They all wore evening dress: a close fitting jacket with tails, a white shirt with black bow tie, a waistcoat, narrow trousers, white socks and leather shoes. The hands wore white cotton gloves.\n\nEach body was identical to all the others. The man had a pale face, an aquiline nose and a thin moustache. His lips were pale. He had a narrow brow and receding hair, which was brilliantined back. Some of the faces were staring up at the rack above them, or at the rocky ceiling. Others had their necks turned, so they faced to one side or the other.\n\nAll the corpses had their eyes open.\n\nMost of them were smiling, showing their teeth.\n\nThe corpses all lay in different positions. Some were straight, others were twisted or bent over. Every corpse had one foot in the air.\n\nThe arms too were in varying positions. Some were raised above the head, some were stretched forward like those of a sleepwalker, others lay straight beside the body.\n\nThere was no sign of decay in any of the corpses. It was as if each one had been frozen in life.\n\nThere was no dust on them, no smell from them.\n\nA piece of white card had been attached to the front edge of each shelf. It was handwritten, and mounted in a plastic holder clipped to the underside of the shelf. The first one I looked at said this:\n\nDominion Theatre, Kidderminster 14/4/01 \n\n3.15 pm (M) \n\n2359/23 \n\n25g.\n\nOn the shelf above it, the card was almost identical:\n\nDominion Theatre, Kidderminster \n\n14/4/01 \n\n8.30 pm (E) \n\n2360/23 \n\n25g.\n\nAbove that, the third corpse was labelled:\n\nDominion Theatre, Kidderminster 15/4/01 \n\n3.15 pm (M) \n\n2361/23 \n\n25g.\n\nOn the next rack there were three more corpses, all labelled and dated similarly. They were laid out in date order. Theatres and dates changed. They were many.\n\nI moved on, squeezing down the narrow central aisle to the far end of the cavern. Here, on the top shelf of the final rack, I came across the body of a little boy.\n\nHe had died struggling. His head was tilted back, and turned to the right. His mouth was open, with the corners of his lips turned down. His eyes were wide open, and looking up. His hair was flying. All his limbs were tensed, as if he had been fighting to be free. He was wearing a dark red sweatshirt, a small pair of blue jeans, and blue canvas shoes.\n\nHis label was also handwritten, and it said:\n\nCaldlow House \n\n17/12/70 \n\n7.45 pm \n\n0000/23 \n\n0g.\n\nOn the top was the boy's name: Nicholas Julius Borden.\n\nI took the label and put it into my pocket, then reached forward and pulled him towards me. I held him in my arms. At the moment I touched him, the constant background presence of my brother faded away and died.\n\nI was aware of his absence for the first time ever.\n\nLooking down at him in my arms, I tried to shape him into a more comfortable position for carrying. His limbs, neck and torso were stiffly flexible, as if made of strong rubber. I could change their position, but the moment I released them they swung back into the shape in which I had found him.\n\nWhen I tried to smooth his hair that too moved back to its former position.\n\nI held him tightly against me. He was neither cold nor warm. One of his outstretched hands, clenched in fear, was touching the side of my face. The relief of finding him at last overwhelmed everything - everything except the fear of this place. I wanted to turn around so that I could head back towards the exit, but to do so involved moving backwards out of the corridor. I held my past life in my arms, but I no longer knew what might be standing behind me.\n\nSomething was, though.\n\nCHAPTER THREE.\n\nI walked backwards, not looking. I reached the main aisle, and turned slowly around.\n\nI saw that at this end of the hall there was another chamber, just five or six feet away from where I was standing. It was from here that the sound of the generator's engine was emerging. I went towards it. The entrance to the cavity was slanting and low.\n\nThe sound of the generator was now loud, and I could smell the petrol fumes emitted from it. There were several more lights within the chamber, beyond the entrance. I could not go through the gap without putting down Nicky's body, so I bent over to try to see what might be within.\n\nI had seen nothing. Nothing moved within.\n\nI took a step back, then another, as quietly as possible.\n\nThere had been someone standing inside that chamber, silently, motionlessly, just beyond my line of sight, waiting for me either to enter or retreat.\n\nI continued to step back down the shadowy narrow aisle between the racks, trying not to scrape Nicky's head or feet against the bodies on the shelves. Terror was draining strength from my body.\n\nA male voice said, from within the chamber, reverberating around the hall, \"You're a Borden, aren't you\"?\n\nI said nothing, paralysed by fear.\n\n\"I thought you'd come for him in the end\". The voice was thin, tired, not much more than a whisper, but the cavern gave it an echoing resonance. \"He is you, Borden, and these are all me. Are you going to leave with him? Or are you going to stay\"?\n\nI saw a ghostly shadow moving beyond the entrance, and then to my horror the sound of the generator faded quickly away.\n\nI was in impenetrable darkness. The torch was in my pocket. I shifted the weight of the little boy, and managed to get a grip on the torch.\n\nWith my hand shaking, I switched it on. I tried to get a good grip on the torch and keep Nicky's body held tightly in my arms. I twisted around.\n\nShadows of raised legs whirled about me on the cavern walls.\n\nI shoved my way along the rest of the aisle through the racks. My shoulders and arms were colliding with the shelves, and dislodged several plastic labels.\n\nI dared not look behind me. The man was following! My legs had no strength, I knew I could fall at any moment.\n\nIt was all uphill, now, and Nicky's deadweight seemed heavier with every step. I turned my foot, fell against the tunnel wall, recovered, kept walking on. Fear drove me.\n\nThe inner door appeared before me at last. Barely pausing, I pulled it open with my booted foot and forced my way through.\n\nBehind me, I could hear the footsteps following, pacing steadily.\n\nI ran up the stairs to the surface, but snow had blown in and was covering the top four or five steps. I slipped, fell forward, and the little boy rolled out of my arms! I leapt forward, pushed the door open with all my weight.\n\nI saw: snow-covered ground, the black shape of the house, two windows lighted, an open doorway with a light beyond, snow falling from the sky!\n\nMy brother yelled in my mind!\n\nI turned back, found him sprawled across the steps, and picked him up. I stumbled out into the snow.\n\nI staggered through the thick snow, aiming for the doorway, turning my head constantly to look back over my shoulder at the black rectangle of the open vault, dreading to see the emergence of whatever it was that had been following me.\n\nKate appeared at the open doorway, dressed in a coat.\n\nI tried to shout a warning to her, but I could not find the breath. I continued on, staggering in the snow, holding Nicky's body before me. At last, I reached the yard in front of the door, slipped on the snow-covered concrete and pushed past Kate into the brightly lit hallway beyond.\n\nShe stared wordlessly at the body of the little boy in my arms.\n\n\"Watch the vault\"! I said. It was the only sentence I could get out. \"Watch\"!\n\nNothing was moving, over there on the other side of the snow. I took a step back, put down Nicky's body on the floor.\n\nI fumbled in my pocket and found the label that had been on Nicky's rack. I gave it to Kate. I was still struggling for breath, and I felt as if I would never again breathe normally.\n\nI gasped, \"Look at this! The handwriting! Is it the same\"?\n\nShe took it from me, held it up in the light, and gazed intently at it. Then she looked straight back at me. Her eyes were wide with fear.\n\n\"It is, isn't it\"? I shouted.\n\nShe put her hands around the upper part of my arm, and held herself against me. I could feel her trembling.\n\nThe intruder light went out.\n\n\"Switch it on again\"! I shouted.\n\nKate found the switch. Then she held my arm again.\n\nThe snow whirled in the blaze of light. Through it, vaguely, we could see the entrance to the vault. We both saw the slight figure of a man emerging from the door of the vault. He was dressed in dark clothes. Long black hair straggled out from under the hood of his jacket. He raised a hand to protect his eyes from the glaring light. He showed no curiosity about us, or fear of us, even though he must have known we were there, watching him. Without looking at us, he stepped out on to the flat ground, hunching his shoulders in the blizzard, then moved to the right, between the trees, down the hill, and out of our sight.",
        "ru": "ЧАСТЬ ПЕРВАЯ.\n\nЭНДРЮ УЭСТЛИ.\n\nГЛАВА ПЕРВАЯ.\nВсе началось в поезде, направлявшемся на север через Англию, хотя вскоре я обнаружил, что на самом деле история началась более ста лет назад.\n\nЯ собирался уточнить сообщение об инциденте в религиозной секте. На коленях у меня лежал большой конверт, полученный утром от отца, еще не вскрытый, потому что, когда папа позвонил, чтобы сообщить мне об этом, мои мысли были далеко. Моя девушка покидала меня.\n\nЯ открыл Папин конверт. Оттуда выскользнула широкоформатная книга в мягкой обложке с запиской внутри и использованным конвертом, сложенным пополам.\n\nВ записке говорилось: \"Дорогой Энди, вот книга, о которой я тебе рассказывал. Думаю, его прислала та же женщина, что звонила мне. Она спросила, не знаю ли я, где ты. Я прилагаю конверт, в котором прибыла книга. Почтовый штемпель немного размыт, но, может быть, вы сможете его разобрать. Твоя мама хотела бы знать, когда ты снова приедешь к нам. Как насчет следующих выходных? С любовью, папа\".\n\nНаконец я вспомнил кое-что из телефонного разговора отца. Он сказал мне, что книга прибыла и что женщина, которая прислала ее, кажется, была дальней родственницей, потому что она говорила о моей семье.\n\nНо вот она, книга. Она называлась \"тайные методы магии\", и ее автором был некий Альфред Борден. Это был один из учебников карточных фокусов, иллюзий с шелковыми шарфами и так далее. Единственное, что меня на первый взгляд заинтересовало, - это то, что, хотя это была недавно изданная книга в мягкой обложке, сам текст выглядел как репродукция гораздо более старого издания: типография, иллюстрации, заголовки глав и стиль письма-все говорило об этом.\n\nЯ не мог понять, почему меня заинтересовала такая книга. Мне было знакомо только имя автора: Борден-фамилия, с которой я родился, хотя, когда меня усыновили маленьким ребенком, мое имя было изменено. Теперь мое полное и законное имя-Эндрю Уэстли, и хотя я всегда знал, что меня усыновили, я вырос, думая о Дункане и Джиллиан Уэстли как о папе и маме, любил их как родителей и вел себя как их сын. Все это по-прежнему верно. Я ничего не чувствую к своим родным родителям. Они меня не интересуют, и у меня нет ни малейшего желания выслеживать их теперь, когда я взрослая.\n\nЕсть, однако, один вопрос, касающийся моего происхождения, который почти навязчив.\n\nЯ почти уверен, что родился одним из двух однояйцевых близнецов и что мы с братом были разлучены во время усыновления. Я понятия не имею, почему это было сделано, и где мог быть мой брат, но я всегда предполагал, что он был усыновлен одновременно со мной. Я начал подозревать о его существовании, когда мне было тринадцать. Случайно я наткнулся на отрывок из книги \"приключенческая история\", в котором описывалось, как многие пары близнецов связаны необъяснимым психическим контактом. Даже живя в разных странах, такие Близнецы будут разделять чувства боли, удивления, счастья, депрессии, посылая одного близнеца другому, и наоборот. Чтение этой книги было одним из тех моментов в жизни, когда вдруг многое становится ясным.\n\nВсю свою жизнь, сколько я себя помню, у меня было чувство, что кто-то другой разделяет мою жизнь. Будучи ребенком, я мало думал об этом и предполагал, что все остальные испытывают те же чувства. Когда я стал старше и понял, что никто из моих друзей не проходит через то же самое, это стало загадкой. Поэтому чтение книги принесло огромное облегчение, так как она все объясняла. У меня где-то был близнец.\n\nОщущение связи, как правило, смутно. Это ощущение того, что кто-то заботится о вас. Более прямые \"послания\" приходят лишь изредка. Например, раз или два, когда я был пьян, я чувствовал, как во мне растет тревога моего брата, страх, что я могу пострадать. В один из таких случаев, когда я поздно вечером уходил с вечеринки и собирался ехать домой, вспышка беспокойства, охватившая меня, была настолько сильной, что я ехал домой необъяснимо трезвым в тот вечер.\n\nИногда я также ощущал, что мой брат страдает, или напуган, или чем-то ему угрожает, и мог \"посылать\" ему чувства спокойствия, сочувствия или утешения. Это психический механизм, который я могу использовать, не понимая его. Никто никогда не объяснял этого, хотя это распространено и хорошо документировано.\n\nОднако в моем случае есть еще одна загадка.\n\nЧто касается записей, то у меня никогда не было никакого брата. У меня есть некоторые воспоминания о моей жизни до усыновления, хотя мне было всего три года, когда это произошло, и я совсем не помню своего брата. Папа и мама ничего об этом не знали.\n\nКак усыновленный, вы имеете определенные юридические права. Самым важным из них является защита от ваших естественных родителей: они не могут связаться с вами никакими законными средствами. Другое право заключается в том, что, когда вы достигнете совершеннолетия, вы сможете спросить о некоторых обстоятельствах вашего усыновления. Вы можете узнать имена ваших естественных родителей и адрес суда, где было произведено усыновление, а следовательно, где можно изучить важные документы.\n\nВскоре после того, как мне исполнилось восемнадцать, я занялся всем этим, желая узнать все, что можно, о своем брате. Я узнал, что меня отдал на усыновление мой отец, которого звали Клайв Александр Борден. Мою мать звали Диана Рут Борден (урожденная Эллингтон), но она умерла вскоре после моего рождения. Я предполагал, что усыновление произошло из-за ее смерти, но на самом деле меня не усыновляли более двух лет после ее смерти, в течение которых отец воспитывал меня сам. Мое настоящее имя было Николас Джулиус Борден. Ни о каком другом ребенке не было и речи.\n\nНесмотря на это, мои экстрасенсорные контакты с моим близнецом сохранялись все это время и продолжались с тех пор.\n\nКнига была издана в США. На обложке был изображен фокусник, выразительно указывающий руками на деревянный шкаф, из которого выходила молодая дама. На ней была ослепительная улыбка и костюм, который для того времени выглядел дерзко.\n\nПод именем автора было напечатано: \"отредактировано и аннотировано Лордом Колдердейлом\".\n\nВ нижней части обложки была надпись:\"знаменитая охраняемая клятвой Книга Тайн\".\n\nНа задней обложке была более длинная и более описательная рекомендация:\n\nПервоначально изданная строго ограниченным тиражом в 1905 году в Лондоне, эта книга продавалась только профессиональным магам, которые давали клятву хранить ее содержание в тайне. Экземпляры первого издания сейчас очень редки.\n\nВпервые опубликованное в открытом доступе, это новое издание полностью не сокращено и содержит все оригинальные иллюстрации, а также заметки, предоставленные британским графом Колдердейлом, известным современным любителем магии.\n\nАвтор-Альфред Борден, изобретатель легендарной иллюзии \"новый перенесенный человек\". Борден, чье сценическое имя было Le Professeur de la Magie, был в первом десятилетии этого столетия ведущим сценическим иллюзионистом. Поощряемый в ранние годы Джоном Генри Андерсоном и как протеже Невила Маскелайна, Борден был современником Гудини, Дэвида Деванта, Чон Лин Су и Буатье де Колта. Он базировался в Лондоне, Англия, но часто гастролировал по Соединенным Штатам и Европе.\n\nЭта книга с ее широким пониманием магических методов даст как непрофессионалам, так и профессионалам поразительное понимание ума одного из величайших магов, когда-либо живших.\n\nБыло забавно узнать, что один из моих предков был магом, но я не испытывал особого интереса к этому предмету. Иллюзии, которые вы иногда видите по телевизору, впечатляют, но мне никогда не было любопытно, как достигается эффект. Кто-то однажды сказал, что беда магии в том, что чем больше маг защищает свои секреты, тем банальнее они оказываются.\n\nВ книге Альфреда Бордена был длинный раздел о карточных фокусах, а в другом описывались фокусы с сигаретами и монетами. К каждому прилагались пояснительные рисунки и инструкции. В конце книги была глава о сценических иллюзиях, с многочисленными иллюстрациями шкафов с потайными отделениями, ящиков с фальшивыми днищами, столов с подъемными устройствами, спрятанными за занавесками, и других приспособлений. Я просмотрел некоторые из этих страниц.\n\nПервая половина книги не была иллюстрирована, но состояла из длинного рассказа о жизни автора и его взглядах на магию. Она начиналась следующими словами::\n\nЯ пишу в 1901 году.\n\nМое настоящее имя-Альфред Борден. История моей жизни - это история тайн, с помощью которых я прожил свою жизнь. Они описаны в этом повествовании в первый и последний раз.\n\nЯ родился в 1856 году, в восьмой день мая, в прибрежном городе Гастингсе. Я был здоровым, энергичным ребенком. Мой отец был торговцем, мастером-Колесником и Бондарем. Наш дом -\n\nИнтересно, какое отношение ко мне имеет Альфред Борден? Если бы он не был моим двоюродным братом или дядей, то он был бы моим прапрадедом. Если он родился в 1856 году, то ему было около сорока пяти, когда он написал эту книгу; следовательно, он не был отцом моего отца, а принадлежал к более раннему поколению.\n\nВступление было написано почти в том же стиле, что и основной текст. Книга была основана на личной записной книжке Бордена, не предназначенной для публикации. Колдердейл значительно расширил и уточнил повествование и добавил описания большинства трюков. Дополнительной биографической информации о Бордене не было, но, вероятно, я найду ее, если прочитаю всю книгу.\n\nЯ не мог понять, как книга могла рассказать мне что-нибудь о моем брате. Он оставался моим единственным интересом к моей родной семье.\n\nВ этот момент мой мобильный телефон запищал. Это была Соня, секретарь моего редактора Лена Уикхема.\n\n- Энди, насчет машины планы изменились, - сказала она. - Эрику Ламберту пришлось отвезти его на ремонт тормозов,так что он стоит в гараже.\n\nОна дала мне адрес. Эта машина в Шеффилде, старый \"Форд\", мешала мне подъехать на своей машине. Лен не допустил бы расходов, если бы была доступна служебная машина.\n\n- Дядя еще что-нибудь говорил? Я сказал.\n\n\"Например\"?\n\n\"Эта история все еще продолжается\"?\n\n\"Да\".\n\n-Что-нибудь еще пришло из агентств?\n\n-Мы получили подтверждение по факсу из Калифорнии. Франклин все еще в плену\".\n\n\"Хорошо\".\n\nМы повесили трубку. Потом я поговорил с отцом. Я сказал ему, что еду в Шеффилд, оттуда поеду в Пик-Дистрикт, и если они не возражают (конечно, так и будет) Я могу приехать и остаться на ночь. - Отец казался довольным. Они с Джиллиан по-прежнему жили в Уилмслоу, графство Чешир, и теперь, когда я работал в Лондоне, мои поездки к ним были нечастыми.\n\nПовесив трубку, я положил книгу в чемодан и стал смотреть в окно поезда на проплывающую мимо сельскую местность. Я должен был сосредоточиться на инциденте, который собирался расследовать. Я работал в \"Кроникл\" журналистом. На самом деле отец сам был газетчиком и раньше работал в \"Манчестер Ивнинг пост\", газете-сестре \"Кроникл\". Он гордился тем, что я получил эту работу, хотя всегда подозревал, что он дергает за ниточки.\n\nЛен Уикхем, мой главный редактор, поручал мне любую историю, которая касалась ведьм, левитации, самовозгорания, кругов на полях и других необычных тем. В большинстве случаев, как я уже выяснил, если хорошенько вникнуть в эти вещи, о них вообще мало что можно сказать, и очень немногие из написанных мною рассказов когда-либо печатались.\n\nНа этот раз был еще один поворот. С некоторым удовольствием Уикхем сообщил мне, что кто-то из секты позвонил, чтобы спросить, планирует ли \"Кроникл\" освещать эту историю, и если да, то попросил меня лично. Они видели некоторые из моих предыдущих статей, думали, что я проявил должную степень честного скептицизма и поэтому мог бы написать правильную статью.\n\nКалифорнийская религиозная секта под названием восторженная Церковь Христа Иисуса основала общину в большом загородном доме в Дербиширской деревне. Несколько дней назад одна из женщин умерла от естественных причин. Ее врач присутствовал, как и ее дочь. Когда она лежала на пороге смерти, в комнату вошел мужчина. Он стоял у кровати и успокаивающе жестикулировал руками. Женщина вскоре умерла, а мужчина сразу же вышел из комнаты, не сказав ни слова остальным. После этого его никто не видел. Дочь женщины и двое членов секты, вошедших в комнату, когда он был там, узнали в нем человека, основавшего секту. Это был отец Патрик Франклин, и секта выросла вокруг него из-за его заявленной способности к двуязычию.\n\nИнцидент был достоин внимания по двум причинам. Это был первый из билокаций Франклина, засвидетельствованных не членами секты. А вторая причина заключалась в том, что местонахождение Франклина в тот день можно было точно установить: он находился в тюрьме в Калифорнии, и, как только что подтвердила мне Соня по телефону, он все еще был там.\n\nГЛАВА ВТОРАЯ.\n\nОбщина была основана на окраине деревни Пик-Дистрикт-Колдлоу, когда-то центра добычи сланца, а теперь зависящего от дневных туристов. Там был клуб пони-треккинга, несколько сувенирных магазинов и гостиница.\n\nЯ остановился в деревне выпить чашку чая, думая, что смогу поговорить с кем-нибудь из местных о восторженной Церкви, но кроме меня в кафе никого не было, и женщина, работавшая за стойкой, сказала, что ежедневно приезжает из Честерфилда.\n\nПока я сидел там, мой брат неожиданно вступил со мной в контакт. Ощущение было настолько отчетливым, что я удивленно повернул голову, подумав на мгновение, что кто-то в комнате обратился ко мне. Я закрыл глаза, опустил лицо и прислушивалась, не более.\n\nНет слов. Ничего такого, на что я мог бы ответить, записать или даже выразить словами. Но я чувствовал предвкушение, счастье, волнение, удовольствие, поддержку.\n\nЯ попытался отослать назад: \"к чему вы меня подталкиваете? Это что-то связанное с этой религиозной общиной?\n\nЯ надеялся, что от него поступит еще один сигнал. Я попыталась мысленно дотянуться до него, думая, что, возможно, его контакт со мной был способом заставить меня общаться с ним, но в этом смысле я ничего не чувствовала.\n\nЯ допила чай, поставила чашку с блюдцем на стойку, вежливо улыбнулась и поспешила к машине. Когда я сел и захлопнул дверь, пришло второе сообщение от моего брата. Это было то же самое, что и первое, прямое побуждение меня приехать, быть там с ним. Это все еще было невозможно выразить словами.\n\nВход в восторженную церковь был закрыт парой ворот и сторожкой. Я припарковал машину и направился к сторожке. Внутри деревянного крыльца к стене был прикреплен современный колокольчик, а под ним-напечатанное лазером объявление :\n\nВОСТОРЖЕННАЯ ЦЕРКОВЬ ХРИСТА ИИСУСА\n\nПРИВЕТСТВУЕТ ВАС\n\nНИКАКИХ ПОСЕТИТЕЛЕЙ БЕЗ ПРЕДВАРИТЕЛЬНОЙ ЗАПИСИ\n\nДЛЯ ВСТРЕЧ ЗВОНИТЕ КОЛДЛОУ 393960\n\nТОРГОВЦЫ И ПРОЧИЕ ДВАЖДЫ НАЖИМАЮТ НА КОЛОКОЛЬЧИК\n\nИИСУС ЛЮБИТ ТЕБЯ.\n\nЯ дважды нажал на кнопку звонка, но без всякого эффекта.\n\nЯ вернулся к машине и, прислонившись спиной к крылу, стал ждать. Вскоре ворота бесшумно открылись по какой-то удаленной команде, поэтому я снова забрался в машину и поехал по гравийной дорожке. В поле зрения показался главный дом: это было огромное и непривлекательное здание в четыре или пять основных этажей, с черными крышами и стенами из темно-коричневого кирпича и камня. Окна были высокими и узкими. От этого места мне стало холодно, но, даже ведя машину, я снова ощутил присутствие брата, который подгонял меня.\n\nЯ увидел знак \"посетители сюда\" и пошел по гравийной дорожке вдоль главной стены дома. Я толкнул дверь и вошел в узкий коридор. В этом здании царила тишина.\n\nЯ увидел дверь с табличкой \"приемная\" и постучал. Когда ответа не последовало, я просунул голову в дверь, но комната была пуста. Услышав шаги, я вернулся в коридор, и через несколько мгновений на повороте лестницы появилась худая женщина средних лет. В руках у нее было несколько папок-конвертов. Она посмотрела тот перевел вопросительный взгляд на меня, когда она увидела меня там.\n\n-Я ищу Миссис Холлоуэй, - сказал я. \"Ты-это она\"?\n\n- Да, это я. Чем я могу вам помочь?\"\n\n-Меня зовут Эндрю Уэстли, и я из\"Кроникл\". Я показал ей свою пресс-карточку, но она лишь мельком взглянула на нее. -Я хотел бы задать вам несколько вопросов об отце Франклине.\n\n- Отец Франклин сейчас в Калифорнии.\n\n-Я так думаю, но на прошлой неделе произошел инцидент-\"\n\n- Что ты имеешь в виду? - сказала миссис Холлоуэй.\n\n- Насколько я понимаю, здесь видели отца Франклина?\n\nОна медленно покачала головой. -Мне кажется,вы совершаете ошибку, Мистер Уэстли.\n\n- Вы видели отца Франклина, когда он был здесь? Я сказал. -Я этого не делал. И его здесь не было. Вы связывались с нашей пресс-службой?\n\n\"Они здесь\"?\n\n- У нас есть офис в Лондоне. Через них организуются все интервью для прессы\".\n\n-Мне сказали прийти сюда.\n\n\"Нашим пресс-офицером\"?\n\n- Нет... Как я понял, запрос был послан в \"Кроникл\" после того, как появился отец Франклин. Вы отрицаете, что это произошло?\n\n-Вы имеете в виду отправку запроса? Никто здесь не связывался с вашей газетой. Если вы имеете в виду, отрицаю ли я появление отца Франклина, то ответ-да\".\n\nМы уставились друг на друга. Я разрывался между раздражением на нее и досадой на себя. Всякий раз, когда подобные инциденты не проходили гладко, я винил себя в отсутствии опыта и мотивации. Другие писатели в газете всегда знали, как обращаться с такими людьми, как Миссис Холлоуэй.\n\n- Могу я увидеть Того, Кто здесь главный? Я сказал.\n\n-Я глава администрации. Все остальные вовлечены в учение\".\n\nЯ уже собирался сдаться, но спросил: \"мое имя вам что-нибудь говорит?\"\n\n\"А должно\"?\n\n\"Кто-то просил меня по имени\".\n\n\"Это пришло не отсюда\".\n\n- Подожди, - сказал я.\n\nЯ вернулся к машине, чтобы забрать записки, которые мне дал Уикхем накануне. Когда я вернулся, миссис Холлоуэй все еще стояла у подножия лестницы, но куда-то положила свою пачку папок.\n\nСтоя рядом с ней, я перевернул страницу, которую прислали Уикхему. Это было факсимильное сообщение. Там было написано: \"мистеру л. Уикхему, редактору \"Хроникл\". Необходимые письменные сведения, которые вы запросили, следующие: восторженная Церковь Христа Иисуса, Колдлоу, Дербишир. В полумиле от деревни Колдлоу, к северу, на шоссе А623. Миссис Холлоуэй, администратор, предоставит вашему репортеру мистеру Эндрю Уэстли информацию. К Анже.\n\n-Нас это не касается, - сказала миссис Холлоуэй. \"Мне очень жаль\".\n\n- Кто такой К Анже\"? Я сказал. - Мистер? Миссис\"?\n\n-Она живет в частном крыле с восточной стороны этого здания и не имеет никакого отношения к Церкви. Спасибо\".\n\nОна положила руку мне на локоть и вежливо подтолкнула к двери. Она указала, что продолжение гравийной дорожки приведет меня к воротам, где находится вход в частное крыло.\n\n- Простите, если произошло недоразумение. Я не знаю, как это случилось\".\n\n-Если вам нужна дополнительная информация о Церкви, я был бы признателен, если бы вы поговорили с пресс-службой. В этом его функция, знаете ли\".\n\n\"Да, хорошо\".\n\nОна вернулась в здание и закрыла за собой дверь.\n\nЯ решил вернуться в офис. Я позвонил по прямой линии Лэну Уикхему и рассказал ему о случившемся.\n\n-Вы уже видели информатора? - сказал он. - Некто по имени Энджер.\n\n-Я сейчас как раз возле их дома, - сказал я. -Я не думаю, что это история. Я думаю, что это может быть просто спор между соседями. Ну, знаете, жаловаться на что-то\".\n\nПоследовало долгое молчание.\n\nПотом лен Уикхем сказал: \"Посмотри на соседа и, если там что-нибудь есть, перезвони мне. Если нет, возвращайтесь в Лондон сегодня вечером\".\n\n- Сегодня пятница, - сказал я. - Я решила навестить родителей Сегодня вечером.\n\nУикхем ответил, положив трубку.\n\nГЛАВА ТРЕТЬЯ.\n\nУ главного входа в крыло меня встретила женщина, которая внимательно посмотрела на мою пресс-карточку, затем провела в боковую комнату и попросила подождать. Комната была обставлена просто, но привлекательно: индийские ковры, старинные стулья и полированный стол. Минут через пять женщина вернулась.\n\n- Леди Кэтрин сейчас примет вас, - сказала она.\n\nОна провела меня наверх, в большую уютную гостиную, окна которой выходили на долину и высокие скалы.\n\nУ открытого камина стояла молодая женщина и, когда я подошел к ней, протянула мне руку. Меня смутило неожиданное известие о том, что я нахожусь в гостях у аристократа, но ее манеры были сердечными. Она была высокой, темноволосой, с широким лицом и сильной челюстью.\n\nУ нее было нервное выражение лица, как будто она беспокоилась о том, что я могу сказать или подумать.\n\nОна приветствовала меня официально, но в тот момент, когда другая женщина вышла из комнаты, ее манеры изменились. Она представилась как Кейт, а не Кэтрин, Энджер, и велела мне не обращать внимания на титул, поскольку сама она редко им пользовалась. Она попросила меня подтвердить, что я Эндрю Уэстли. Я ответил, что да.\n\n- Полагаю, вы только что побывали в главной части дома?\n\n- Восторженная Церковь? Я с трудом прошел мимо двери\".\n\n- Думаю, это была моя вина. Я предупредила их, что вы можете прийти,но миссис Холлоуэй была не слишком довольна.\n\n\"Я предполагаю, что это был ты, кто послал сообщение к моей работе\"?\n\n\"Я хотел встретиться с тобой\".\n\n\"Но почему\"?\n\n-Я собираюсь рассказать тебе. Но я еще не обедал. А как же ты?\"\n\nЯ сказал ей, что не ел с самого завтрака. Я последовал за ней вниз, на первый этаж, где женщина, открывшая мне дверь, которую леди Кэтрин назвала Миссис Макин, готовила простой обед из холодного мяса и сыра с салатом.\n\nПока мы ели, продолжалась вежливая беседа, в ходе которой она задавала мне вопросы о газете, моей карьере, о том, где я живу и так далее. Когда я наконец почувствовал, что пришло время расспросить ее о себе, она сказала, что дом, в котором мы живем, принадлежит ее семье уже более трехсот лет. Ее отец был графом, но жил за границей. Ее мать умерла, а единственная близкая родственница, старшая сестра, вышла замуж и жила в Бристоле с мужем и детьми.\n\nДо начала Второй мировой войны дом был семейным, с несколькими слугами. Министерство обороны тогда реквизировало большую часть здания. В этот момент ее семья переехала в восточное крыло. После войны дом был передан Совету графства Дербишир под офисы, и нынешние жильцы (ее фраза) прибыли в 1980 году. Она сказала, что ее родители сначала были обеспокоены перспективой переезда американской религиозной секты, но к этому времени семья нуждалась в деньгах, и все сложилось хорошо. Церковь хранила свое учение в тайне,а ее члены были вежливы и любезны.\n\nПоскольку к этому моменту разговора мы уже закончили трапезу и миссис Макин принесла нам кофе, я сказал: \"Итак, я так понимаю, что история, которая привела меня сюда, о священнике-билокате, была ложной\"?\n\n- И да, и нет. Культ не делает секрета из того, что он основывает свое учение на словах своего лидера. Предполагается, что отец Франклин способен к двуязычию, но независимые свидетели никогда не видели, чтобы он делал это, или, по крайней мере, при контролируемых обстоятельствах\".\n\n-Но было ли это правдой?\n\n-Я действительно не уверена. На этот раз в дело был вовлечен местный врач, и она почему-то сказала что-то бульварной газете. Я узнал об этом только на днях, когда был в деревне. Я не думаю, что это было правдой: их лидер в тюрьме в Америке, не так ли?\n\n-Но почему ты просто не написала мне письмо? Я сказал.\n\n-Я не был уверен, что ты тот, за кого я тебя принял. Я хотел сначала встретиться с тобой\".\n\n-Я не понимаю, почему вы решили, что религиозный фанатик билоков имеет ко мне какое-то отношение.\n\n-Это было просто совпадение. Вы знаете спор об иллюзии и все такое\". Опять же, она посмотрела на меня выжидательно.\n\n\"За кого ты меня принимаешь?\"\n\n- Сын Клайва Бордена. Разве не так?\"\n\n-Человек по имени Клайв Борден был моим родным отцом, - сказал я. - Но меня удочерили, когда мне было три.\n\n-Ну что ж. Я был прав насчет тебя. Мы уже встречались однажды, много лет назад, когда оба были детьми. Тогда тебя звали Ники\".\n\n-Не помню, - сказал я. \"Где состоялась эта встреча?\"\n\n- Здесь, в этом доме. Ты действительно этого не помнишь?\n\n\"Вовсе нет\".\n\n-У тебя есть еще какие-нибудь воспоминания о том времени, когда ты был в этом возрасте? - сказала она.\n\n- Только фрагменты. Но ничего об этом месте. Это такой дом, который произвел бы впечатление на ребенка, не так ли?\n\n- Все в порядке. Ты не первый, кто это говорит. Моя сестра... она ненавидит этот дом и не может дождаться, когда уедет\". Она потянулась за спину, где на прилавке лежал маленький колокольчик, и дважды позвонила. - Обычно я пью после обеда. Не хотите ли присоединиться ко мне?\n\n\"Да, спасибо\".\n\nВскоре появилась миссис Макин, и леди Кэтрин встала.\n\n- Мы с мистером Уэстли будем сегодня в гостиной, Миссис Макин.\n\nКогда мы поднимались по широкой лестнице, меня охватило желание убежать от нее, уйти из этого дома. Она знала обо мне больше, чем я сам, но это было знание той части моей жизни, которая меня не интересовала. Очевидно, это был день, когда я должен был снова стать Борденом, хотел я этого или нет. Сначала была его книга, теперь эта. Все это было связано, но я чувствовал, что ее интриги не были моими. Почему я должна заботиться о мужчине, о семье, которая отвернулась от меня?\n\nОна провела меня в комнату, где мы впервые встретились, и закрыла за нами дверь. Серебряный поднос с бутылками, стаканами и ведерком со льдом стоял на низком столике между несколькими стульями и длинным диваном. В одном из бокалов уже стоял большой напиток, по-видимому, приготовленный Миссис Макин. Кейт жестом предложила мне присесть, а потом спросила: Что пожелаете?\n\nЯ сказал:\"я выпью все, что вы пьете\".\n\n- Это американский виски с содовой. Ты тоже этого хочешь?\"\n\nЯ ответил, что да, и наблюдал, как она его смешивает. Усевшись на диван, она поджала под себя ноги и выпила сразу полстакана виски.\n\n\"Как долго ты можешь оставаться?\" - сказала она.\n\n\"Может быть, только этот напиток\".\n\n-Я хочу о многом с тобой поговорить. И о многом хочу тебя спросить\".\n\n\"Почему\"?\n\n- Из-за того, что случилось, когда мы были детьми.\n\n-Не думаю, что смогу вам чем-то помочь, - сказал я. Теперь, когда она перестала так дергаться, я начал более объективно воспринимать ее как довольно привлекательную женщину примерно моего возраста. Она явно любила выпить и привыкла к этому эффекту. Одно это заставляло меня чувствовать, что я нахожусь на знакомой территории; я проводил большую часть выходных, выпивая со своими друзьями.\n\n- Односложный ответ на вопрос может сэкономить много времени, - сказала она.\n\n\"Хорошо\".\n\n-У тебя есть брат-близнец? Или у тебя был кто-то, кто умер, когда ты был совсем маленьким?\n\nЭто было неожиданно.\n\n- Почему ты спрашиваешь? Я сказал.\n\n- А ты знаешь? А ты\"?\n\n-Я не знаю. Думаю, что да, но мне так и не удалось его найти. Я имею в виду... Я не уверен\".\n\n-Думаю, вы дали мне тот ответ, которого я ожидала, - сказала она. -Но не тот, на который я надеялся.\n\n-Если это как-то связано с семейством Борденов, то я говорю вам, что ничего о них не знаю. Осознаете ли вы, что\"?\n\n-Да, но ты же Борден.\n\n- Был, но для меня это ничего не значит. Я вдруг мельком увидел семью этой молодой женщины, растянувшуюся более чем на триста лет в непрерывной череде поколений: то же имя, тот же дом, все то же. Мои собственные семейные корни уходили в трехлетний возраст. -Не думаю,что ты понимаешь, что такое усыновление. Я был всего лишь маленьким мальчиком, и мой отец выбросил меня из своей жизни. Если бы я провел остаток своей жизни, скорбя об этом, у меня не было бы времени ни на что другое. Давным-давно я запечатал его, потому что должен был. Теперь у меня новая семья\".\n\n-Но твой брат все еще Борден.\n\nВсякий раз, когда она упоминала моего брата, я чувствовал укол вины, беспокойства и любопытства. Как будто она использовала его, чтобы проникнуть под мою защиту. Всю свою жизнь существование брата было частью меня самого, которую я держал в полной тайне. И все же эта незнакомка говорила о нем так, словно знала.\n\n- А почему вас это интересует? Я сказал.\n\n-Когда вы впервые услышали обо мне, увидели мое имя, оно вам что-нибудь говорило?\n\n\"Нет\".\n\n-Вы когда-нибудь слышали о Руперте Энджере?\n\n\"Нет\".\n\n- Или Великий Дантон, иллюзионист?\n\n- Нет. Мой единственный интерес к моей бывшей семье заключается в том, что через них я, возможно, однажды смогу найти своего брата-близнеца\".\n\nОна наклонилась, чтобы смешать еще один напиток,и попыталась налить мне еще. Зная, что мне придется сесть за руль позже, я отодвинул свой стакан, прежде чем она смогла полностью наполнить его.\n\n- Я думаю, что судьба вашего брата связана с чем-то, что произошло около ста лет назад. Один из моих предков, Руперт Энджер. Вы говорите, что никогда о нем не слышали, да и незачем, но в конце прошлого века он был театральным фокусником. Он работал как Великий Дантон, потому что в те времена все фокусники пользовались грандиозными сценическими именами. Он стал жертвой серии жестоких нападений человека по имени Альфред Борден, вашего прадеда, который также был иллюзионистом. Вы говорите, что ничего об этом не знаете?\n\n- Только книга. Полагаю, вы его послали\".\n\nОна кивнула. \"У них была эта вражда, и она продолжалась годами. Они постоянно нападали друг на друга, обычно вмешиваясь в сценическое представление другого. История этой вражды есть в книге Бордена. По крайней мере, с его стороны. Вы его еще не читали?\"\n\n- Письмо пришло только сегодня утром. У меня не было большого шанса -\"\n\n- Я подумал,что вам будет интересно узнать, что произошло.\n\nЯ снова подумал: зачем говорить о Борденах? Они слишком далеко ушли, я слишком мало о них знаю. Она говорила о чем-то, что интересовало ее, а не меня. Глубоко внутри меня лежал бессознательный защитный механизм, который ребенок выстраивает для себя, когда его отвергают. Чтобы приспособиться к новой семье, мне пришлось отбросить все, что я знал о старой. Сколько раз мне придется повторять ей это, чтобы убедить ее в этом?\n\nСказав, что хочет мне что-то показать, она поставила стакан и прошла через комнату к столу, стоявшему у стены как раз за тем местом, где я сидел. Когда она наклонилась, чтобы дотянуться до нижнего ящика, ее платье упало на шею, и я мельком увидела: тонкая белая бретелька, часть Кружевной чашечки бюстгальтера. Она пыталась втянуть меня в то, о чем я ничего не знал, но вместо этого я лениво думал о том, каково это-заниматься с ней сексом.\n\n-Я уже целую вечность их не выпускала, - сказала Кейт. Она вытащила несколько фотоальбомов, и они были свалены на полу, когда она потянулась к задней части глубокого ящика. \"Вот мы и пришли\".\n\nОна сжимала в руках неопрятную стопку бумаг, очевидно, старых и выцветших, все разного размера. Она разложила их на кушетке рядом с собой и взяла свой бокал, прежде чем начать листать.\n\n-Мой прадед был одним из тех людей, которые одержимы чистоплотностью, - сказала она. - Он не только все хранил, он наклеивал на них ярлыки, составлял списки, имел специальные шкафы, в которых хранились определенные вещи. Когда я рос, у моих родителей была поговорка:\"дедушкины вещи\". Мы к нему даже не притронулись. Но когда моя сестра уехала, чтобы выйти замуж, и я остался здесь один, я, наконец, прошел через все это и разобрался. Мне удалось продать кое-что из оборудования и костюмов, и я получил хорошие цены. Я нашел эти афиши в комнате, которая была его кабинетом\".\n\nОна протянула мне лист хрупкой желтой бумаги. Счет был за театр \"императрица\" на Эверинг-Роуд, Сток-Ньюингтон. Над списком исполнителей было объявлено ограниченное количество выступлений, во второй половине дня и вечером. Сверху купюры красными чернилами был напечатан ирландский тенор. Были и другие певцы. На середине купюры, на которую указывал указательный палец Кейт, когда она наклонилась ко мне, был великий Дантон (\"величайший иллюзионист в мире\").\n\n-Это было до того, как он на самом деле им стал, - сказала она. - Он провел большую часть своей жизни в тяжелом положении и по-настоящему прославился лишь за несколько лет до смерти. Этот законопроект исходит из 1881 года, когда он впервые начал делать довольно хорошо\".\n\n\"Что все это значит?\" - Сказал я, указывая на колонку цифр, вписанных на полях афиши. На обороте было написано еще больше.\n\n-Это навязчивая система картотеки Великого Дантона, - сказала она. Она отошла от дивана и непринужденно опустилась на колени на ковер рядом с моим креслом. -Я еще не все понял, но первое число относится к работе. Где-то есть журнал с полным списком всех его выступлений. Под этим он записывает, сколько действительных представлений он провел, и сколько из них были утренниками и сколько вечерами. Следующие цифры-это список реальных трюков, которые он делал, и снова у него в кабинете было около дюжины записных книжек с описаниями всех трюков, которые он мог сделать. У меня сохранилось несколько записных книжек, и вы, вероятно, могли бы посмотреть некоторые из трюков, которые он проделывал в Сток-Ньюингтоне. Но это еще сложнее, потому что большинство трюков имеют незначительные вариации, и у него есть все эти перекрестные ссылки. Смотри, вот этот номер, \"10g\". По-моему, именно столько ему и заплатили: десять гиней\".\n\n\"Это было хорошо\"?\n\n\"Если это было на одну ночь, это было великолепно. Но это было, вероятно, на всю неделю, так что это было просто среднее. Я не думаю, что это был Большой театр\".\n\nЯ взял стопку других афиш, и, как она сказала, каждая была снабжена похожими кодовыми номерами.\n\n-Все его приборы тоже были помечены, - сказала она. \"Когда я расчищал подвал, каждый предмет оборудования, на который я наткнулся, имел идентификационный номер, и каждый имел место в огромном индексе, все перекрестные ссылки на другие книги\".\n\n- Когда он умер? Я сказал.\n\n-Как ни странно, в этом есть некоторые сомнения. В газетах пишут, что он умер в 1903 году, и в \"Таймс\" был некролог, но в деревне есть люди, которые говорят, что он все еще жил здесь в следующем году. Что я нахожу странным, так это то, что я наткнулся на некролог в альбоме, который он вел, и он был приклеен, помечен и проиндексирован, как и все остальное\".\n\n- Вы можете объяснить, как это произошло?\n\n- Нет. Альфред Борден рассказывает об этом в своей книге. Вот тут-то я и услышал об этом, а потом попытался выяснить, что же между ними произошло\".\n\n-У тебя есть еще его вещи?\n\nПока она тянулась за альбомами, я налил себе еще глоток американского виски. Было странно находиться там, не до конца понимая, что происходит, говорить о волшебниках, встречах в детстве, не на работе, не ездить к родителям, как я планировала.\n\nВ той части моего сознания, которая была занята братом, я испытывал чувство удовлетворения. Он уговаривал меня остаться. За окном темнело холодное послеполуденное небо. Кейт подбросила в огонь еще одно полено.\n\nЧАСТЬ ВТОРАЯ.\n\nАЛЬФРЕД БОРДЕН.\n\nГЛАВА ПЕРВАЯ.\n\nЯ пишу в 1901 году.\n\nМое настоящее имя-Альфред Борден. История моей жизни - это история тайн, с помощью которых я прожил свою жизнь. Они описаны в этом повествовании в первый и последний раз.\n\nЯ родился в 1856 году, в восьмой день мая, в прибрежном городе Гастингсе. Я был здоровым, энергичным ребенком. Мой отец был торговцем, мастером-Колесником и Бондарем.\n\nНаш дом в доме номер 105 по Мэнор-Роуд был больше и выше, чем другие дома на дороге, потому что он был построен над воротами, которые вели во двор и сараи позади. Моя комната находилась на улице, прямо над воротами, и в ней было шумно каждый день в году и очень холодно в зимние месяцы. Именно в этой комнате я медленно повзрослел и стал тем, кто я есть.\n\nЭтот человек-профессор магии, а я мастер иллюзий.\n\nПора сделать паузу, ибо эта история не о моей жизни, как принято у автобиографов, а, как я уже сказал, о тайнах моей жизни. Секретность очень важна для моей работы.\n\nПозвольте мне сначала рассмотреть и описать метод написания этого отчета. Сам акт описания моих секретов может быть истолкован как предательство самого себя, за исключением, конечно, того, что, поскольку я иллюзионист, я могу убедиться, что вы видите только то, что я хочу, чтобы вы видели.\n\nПоэтому будет справедливо, если я с самого начала попытаюсь прояснить эти тесно связанные темы - секретность и понимание секретности.\n\nВот вам пример.\n\nВо время занятий моей профессией всегда наступает момент, когда престидигитатор как бы останавливается. Он выйдет вперед, к рампе, и будет стоять лицом к зрителям. Он скажет, или, если его действие безмолвно, он, кажется, скажет: \"посмотри на мои руки. В них нет ничего скрытого\". Затем он поднимет руки, чтобы зрители увидели. Держа руки таким образом, он поворачивает их так, чтобы зрителям были показаны спины, и выясняется, что его руки действительно пусты. Тогда фокусник, вероятно, оттянет манжеты своего пиджака на дюйм или два назад, чтобы обнажить запястья, показывая, что там тоже ничего не спрятано. Затем он выполняет свой трюк, и во время него он производит что-то из своих рук: веер, живого голубя или кролика, букет бумажных цветов. Это парадокс, невозможность! Зрители дивятся этой загадке, раздаются аплодисменты.\n\nКак все это могло случиться?\n\nПрестидигитатор и аудитория заключили то, что я называю Договором о покорной магии. Они не выражают этого словами, и действительно, зрители едва ли осознают, что такой договор может существовать, но это то, что он есть.\n\nИсполнитель, конечно, вовсе не колдун, а актер, который играет роль колдуна и хочет, чтобы зрители поверили, хотя бы временно, что он находится в контакте с темными силами. Зрители, тем временем, знают, что то, что они видят, не является истинным колдовством, но они подавляют знание.\n\nАкт демонстрации того, что руки пусты, прежде чем показать, что, несмотря на внешность, они не были пустыми, сам по себе является частью Договора. Пакт подразумевает, что действуют особые условия. В нормальном социальном общении, например, как часто случается, что кто-то должен доказать, что его руки пусты?\n\nЭто иллюстрирует мой метод.\n\nПозвольте мне показать договор о согласии, под которым я пишу эти слова, чтобы те, кто читает их, поняли, что то, что следует за ними, - не колдовство, а видимость его.\n\nСначала позвольте мне, так сказать, показать вам мои руки, ладонями вперед, и я скажу вам (и запомните это хорошенько): \"каждое слово в этой тетради, описывающее мою жизнь и работу, верно, честно и точно в деталях\".\n\nТеперь я поворачиваю руки так, чтобы вы могли видеть их спины, и говорю вам: \"многое из того, что здесь есть, можно проверить. Моя карьера отмечена в газетных подшивках, мое имя фигурирует в книгах биографических справок\".\n\nВ конце концов, я оттягиваю манжеты пиджака, чтобы обнажить запястья, и говорю вам:\"в конце концов, что я выиграю, написав ложную историю, когда она предназначена только для моих собственных глаз, возможно, для глаз моей семьи и будущих поколений, с которыми я никогда не встречусь\"?\n\nВ самом деле, какая выгода?\n\nНо поскольку я показал, что мои руки пусты, вы должны теперь ожидать не только того, что за этим последует иллюзия, но и того, что вы согласитесь с ней!\n\nУже, ни разу не написав лжи, я начал обман, который есть моя жизнь. Ложь содержится в этих словах, даже в самом первом из них. Это ткань всего, что следует за этим, но нигде это не будет видно.\n\nЯ ввел вас в заблуждение разговорами об истине, объективных фактах и мотивах. Точно так же, когда я показываю, что мои руки пусты, я опустил важную информацию, и теперь вы смотрите не в том месте.\n\nКак хорошо известно каждому фокуснику, найдутся те, кто будет озадачен этим, кто признает, что их одурачили, кто заявит, что знает секрет, а кто-то, счастливое большинство, просто примет иллюзию как должное и будет наслаждаться магией ради развлечения.\n\nНо всегда найдется один или два человека, которые заберут тайну с собой и будут беспокоиться о ней, даже не приближаясь к ее разгадке.\n\nПрежде чем я продолжу рассказ о своей жизни, приведу еще один анекдот, иллюстрирующий мой метод.\n\nКогда я был помоложе, там был известный исполнитель из Шанхая, который работал под сценическим псевдонимом чин Лин Фу.\n\nЯ видел выступление Чинга только один раз, несколько лет назад, в театре Адельфи на Лестер-Сквер. В конце представления я подошел к выходу на сцену и прислал свою визитную карточку, а он пригласил меня в свою гримерную. Он не говорил о своей магии, но мой взгляд был прикован к большой стеклянной чаше с золотыми рыбками, которая, будучи, по-видимому, произведена из воздуха, дала его шоу фантастическую кульминацию. Он предложил мне осмотреть чашу, и это было нормально во всех отношениях. В ней лежала дюжина ярких рыбок, и она была наполнена водой. Я попробовал поднять его и поразился его весу.\n\nЧинг видел, как я борюсь с ним, но ничего не сказал. Он явно не был уверен, знаю я его тайну или нет, и не хотел говорить ничего, что могло бы ее раскрыть, даже коллеге-профессионалу. Я не знал, как признаться, что знаю эту тайну, и потому тоже хранил молчание. Я пробыл с ним минут пятнадцать, и все это время он сидел, вежливо кивая в ответ на мои комплименты. Когда я встал, чтобы уйти, он поднялся со стула у зеркала и проводил меня до двери. Он шел, опустив голову, опустив руки по бокам и шаркая, как будто ноги причиняли ему сильную боль.\n\nТеперь, когда прошли годы и он умер, я могу раскрыть его охраняемую тайну.\n\nЕго знаменитая Чаша с золотыми рыбками была с ним на сцене на протяжении всего его выступления, готовая к ее внезапному и таинственному появлению. Его присутствие было искусно скрыто от зрителей. Он нес его под развевающимся мандариновым платьем, зажав между колен, готовый к сенсационному и, по-видимому, чудесному представлению в конце. Никто из зрителей не мог догадаться, как был проделан этот трюк.\n\nЕдинственное возможное место, где можно было спрятать тяжелую чашу, было под его одеждой, но это было логически невозможно. Всем было очевидно, что чин Лин Фу физически слаб;он с трудом передвигался. Взяв лук, он оперся на своего помощника.\n\nРеальность была совершенно иной. Чинг был крепким человеком, обладающим большой физической силой, и нести чашу таким образом было вполне в его силах. Но размер и форма чаши заставляли его шаркать на ходу, как мандарин. Это угрожало тайне, потому что привлекало внимание к тому, как он двигался, поэтому, чтобы защитить тайну, он тасовал ее всю свою жизнь. Он никогда, ни дома, ни на улице, не ходил обычной походкой, чтобы не выдать свою тайну.\n\nТакова природа человека, играющего роль колдуна.\n\nЗрители хорошо знают, что фокусник будет практиковать свои иллюзии годами, но мало кто осознает степень желания престидигитатора обманывать, то, как кажущаяся конфронтация с обычными законами становится навязчивой идеей, которая управляет каждым мгновением его жизни.\n\nУ чин Лин Фу был свой навязчивый обман, и теперь, когда вы прочитали мой анекдот о нем, вы можете правильно предположить, что у меня есть свой. Мой обман управляет моей жизнью, информирует о каждом моем решении, регулирует каждое мое движение. Даже сейчас он контролирует, что я могу написать, а что нет. Я сравнил свой метод с демонстрацией, казалось бы, обнаженных рук, но на самом деле все в этом рассказе представляет собой шаркающую походку здорового человека.\n\nГЛАВА ВТОРАЯ.\n\nРодители отправили меня в школу, где я выучил три РС, а также немного истории, географии и устрашающего французского языка. Мои бесплодные попытки выучить французский имеют иронический результат, потому что во взрослой жизни моя сценическая персона-это французский профессор.\n\nЯ мог бы многое рассказать о своем отце, хорошее и плохое, но ради того, чтобы сосредоточиться на своей собственной истории, скажу самое лучшее. Я любил его и научился у него многим приемам изготовления шкафов, которые помогли мне сделать себе имя и состояние. Мой отец был трудолюбив, честен, трезв, умен и по-своему щедр. Он был справедлив к своим подчиненным. Он не был богобоязненным человеком и не ходил в церковь, но он воспитал свою семью так, чтобы ни их действия, ни бездействие не причиняли вреда другим. Он был блестящим столяром и хорошим Колесником.\n\nМою мать звали Бетси Мэй Борден (урожденная Робертсон), отца-Джозеф Эндрю Борден. У меня было семь братьев и сестер, хотя из-за младенческой смерти я знал только пятерых. Я не был ни старшим, ни младшим ребенком и не пользовался особой симпатией ни одного из родителей. Я рос в разумной гармонии с большинством, если не со всеми моими братьями и сестрами.\n\nКогда мне исполнилось двенадцать, меня забрали из школы и отправили работать подмастерьем колесного мастера во дворе моего отца. Здесь началась моя взрослая жизнь. Мое собственное реальное будущее начало проясняться. Существенными были два фактора.\n\nПервым было обращение с деревом. Я вырос с его видом и запахом, так что и то и другое было мне знакомо. Я начал уважать дерево и понял, что с ним можно сделать. Дерево красивое, прочное, легкое и эластичное. Его можно обрезать практически до любой формы. Его можно красить, отбеливать,сгибать. Он одновременно и выдающийся, и банальный, так что, когда что-то изготовлено из дерева, это дает спокойное ощущение твердой нормальности, и поэтому его почти никогда не замечают.\n\nКороче говоря, это идеальная среда для иллюзиониста.\n\nВ первый же день работы на верфи меня послали учиться ремеслу, взяв на себя самую грубую и тяжелую работу во дворе-я и еще один подмастерье работали в лесопилке. Двенадцатичасовой рабочий день (мы начинали в 6 и заканчивали в 8 каждый день, с тремя короткими перерывами на еду) закалил мое тело и научил меня бояться и уважать лес. После этого посвящения, которое продолжалось в течение нескольких месяцев, я был переведен на менее физическую, но более требовательную работу по обучению резать, поворачивать и гладить дерево для спиц колес. Здесь я регулярно общался с колесными мастерами и другими людьми, работавшими на моего отца, и реже виделся со своими товарищами-подмастерьями.\n\nОднажды утром, примерно через год после того, как я закончил школу, во двор пришел контрактный рабочий по имени Роберт Нунан, чтобы провести давно необходимые ремонтные и отделочные работы на задней стене двора, которая была повреждена во время шторма несколько лет назад. С приходом Нунана произошло второе большое влияние на направление моей будущей жизни.\n\nЯ, занятый своей работой, даже не заметил его, но в час дня, когда мы сделали перерыв на обед, Нунан пришел и сел со мной и другими мужчинами за стол. Он достал колоду игральных карт и спросил, не желает ли кто-нибудь из нас \"найти леди\". Кое-кто из старших поддразнивал его, но кое-кто из нас остался посмотреть. Крошечные суммы денег начали переходить из рук в руки; не мои, потому что у меня не было лишних, но один или два рабочих были готовы поставить несколько пенсов.\n\nЧто меня завораживало, так это то, как плавно и естественно Нунан манипулировал картами. Он был так быстр! Он говорил мягко и убедительно, показывая нам лица трех игральных карт, кладя их на маленькую коробку перед собой быстрым, но плавным движением, затем двигая их своими длинными пальцами, прежде чем остановиться, чтобы бросить нам вызов, чтобы указать, какая из карт была королевой. У рабочих глаза были медленнее, чем у меня; они замечали карту гораздо реже, чем я (хотя я ошибался чаще, чем был прав).\n\nПотом я спросил Нунана: \"как ты это делаешь? Ты мне покажешь\"?\n\n- Настаивал я. - Я хочу знать, как ты это делаешь! - Воскликнул я. - Королева помещена в середину тройки, но вы двигаете карты только дважды, и она не там, где я думаю! В чем секрет?\"\n\nИ вот однажды во время обеда он отвел меня в тихий уголок сарая и показал, как манипулировать тремя картами так, чтобы рука обманывала глаз. Ферзь и другая карта были слегка зажаты между большим и средним пальцами левой руки, одна над другой; третья карта была зажата в правой руке. Когда карты были положены, он двинул руки крест-накрест, проводя кончиками пальцев по поверхности и делая короткую паузу, таким образом предлагая, чтобы королева была положена первой. На самом деле, это почти всегда была одна из других карт, которая тихо скользила перед ней. Это классический трюк, правильное название которого-Трехкарточный Монте.\n\nКогда я понял это, Нунан показал мне несколько других приемов. Все это он проделал небрежно, скорее хвастаясь,чем показывая. Когда он закончил свою демонстрацию, я попробовал применить ту же технику с королевой, но карты рассыпались повсюду. Я попробовал еще раз. Потом еще раз. И так далее, еще долго после того, как сам Нунан потерял интерес и ушел. К вечеру первого дня, оставшись один в своей спальне, я освоил Трехкарточное Монте и начал работать над другими приемами, которые я мельком видел.\n\nОднажды, когда работа над картиной была закончена, Нунан ушел со двора, и я больше никогда его не видел. Я намеревался овладеть искусством, которое, как я теперь знал (из книги, которую я срочно позаимствовал в библиотеке), называлось Legerdemain.\n\nЛегерд, ловкость рук, престидигитация стали доминирующим интересом моей жизни.\n\nГЛАВА ТРЕТЬЯ.\n\nВ последующие три года в моей жизни произошли параллельные события. Во-первых, я был подростком, быстро превращающимся в мужчину. Во-вторых, мой отец быстро понял, что я обладаю заметным мастерством столяра и что работа колесного мастера мне не подходит, поэтому, когда он смог, он обучил меня более тонкому ремеслу изготовления шкафов. Наконец-то я научилась творить магию своими руками.\n\nВсе свободное время я посвящал упражнениям в искусстве престидигитатора. В частности, я изучал и пытался овладеть всеми известными приемами манипулирования игральными картами. Я видел ловкость рук как основу всей магии. Было трудно получить справочники по этому предмету, но книги по магии существуют, и прилежный исследователь может их найти. Ночь за ночью я стояла у себя в комнате перед зеркалом в полный рост и упражнялась в пальминге и форсировании, тасовала карты и раскладывала их, передавала и обмахивала веером. Я изучил искусство дезориентации, в котором фокусник опирается на повседневный опыт зрителей, чтобы запутать их чувства-металлическая клетка, которая выглядит слишком жесткой, чтобы рухнуть, мяч, который кажется слишком большим, чтобы быть спрятанным в рукаве. Я быстро скомбинировал репертуар таких навыков, отрабатывая каждый из них до тех пор, пока не достиг совершенства. Я никогда не переставал практиковаться.\n\nСила и ловкость моих рук были ключом к этому.\n\nКаждый день, даже сейчас, в зрелом возрасте, я тренирую свои руки. Они достаточно сильны, чтобы разорвать запечатанный резиновый теннисный мяч. Я могу сгибать стальные гвозди между пальцами,и если я ударю пяткой ладони по твердой древесине, она расколется. Но та же самая рука может легко подвесить монету за край между моим третьим и четвертым пальцами, в то время как остальная рука пишет на доске или держит руку добровольца из аудитории, и она может держать монету там через все это, прежде чем ловко сдвинуть ее туда, где она может показаться волшебной.\n\nНа левой руке у меня маленький шрам-напоминание о том времени в юности, когда я узнал истинную ценность своих рук. Я уже знал, что человеческая рука-тонкий инструмент, тонкий, сильный и чувствительный. Но плотничать мне было тяжело, неприятный факт я обнаружил однажды утром во дворе. Мгновение потерянного внимания, небрежное движение зубилом, и я сделал глубокий порез на левой руке. Пожилые люди привыкли иметь дело с такими ранениями и знали, что делать; быстро наложили повязку, и меня отвезли в больницу. Две недели после этого моя рука была забинтована. После обескураживающего периода, когда рука была жесткой и неудобной в использовании, в течение двух месяцев я вернулся к нормальной жизни.\n\nНо я воспринял это как предупреждение. Мой легерд был тогда всего лишь хобби. Но это была страсть, даже, Да, начало одержимости. Я не мог допустить, чтобы травма подвергла его опасности!\n\nПоэтому этот разрез стал еще одним поворотным пунктом. До того, как это случилось, я был учеником колесного мастера с интересным времяпрепровождением, но потом я стал молодым магом, который не позволял ничему стоять у него на пути.\n\nЯ прочел его несколько раз.\n\nМногого не хватает! Я думаю, что должен написать о следующей встрече с Джоном Генри Андерсоном, потому что он познакомил меня с Маскелайнами.\n\nЯ полагаю, нет никакой особой причины, почему я не могу сразу перейти к этому?\n\nЛибо я должен сделать это сейчас, либо оставить записку, чтобы я ее нашел. Меняй меня почаще!\n\nЯ ни в коем случае не должен оставаться в стороне:\n\n1: Как я узнал, что делает Энджер,и что я сделал с ним.\n\n2: Олив Уэнскомб (не моя вина).\n\n3: А как же Сара? И Дети?\n\nПакт распространяется даже на это, не так ли? Вот как я это истолковываю. Если это так, то мне придется либо многое опустить, либо вложить гораздо больше.\n\nЯ с удивлением обнаруживаю, как много я уже написал.\n\nГЛАВА ЧЕТВЕРТАЯ.\n\nКогда мне было шестнадцать, в 1872 году, Джон Генри Андерсон привез в Гастингс свое гастролирующее магическое шоу. Я посещал его шоу каждый вечер, занимая места так близко к передней части зала, как только мог себе позволить. В то время он был ведущим сценическим иллюзионистом с гастрольным шоу, и ему приписывали изобретение многочисленных новых эффектов. У него также была репутация человека, помогающего и поощряющего молодых магов.\n\nКаждую ночь мистер Андерсон проделывал один особый трюк, известный в мире магии как современная кабинетная иллюзия. Во время этого он пригласил на сцену небольшую группу добровольцев из зала. Эти люди (они всегда были мужчинами) помогли вытащить на сцену высокий деревянный шкаф на колесах, достаточно приподнятый над полом, чтобы показать, что никто не может войти в него через ловушку в основании. Затем мужчин пригласили осмотреть шкаф изнутри и снаружи, чтобы убедиться, что он пуст, повернуть его, чтобы зрители увидели его со всех сторон, даже выбрать одного из них, чтобы войти на мгновение, чтобы доказать, что никто другой не может быть скрыт внутри. Затем они помогли запереть дверь и заперли ее на тяжелые висячие замки. Пока группа оставалась на сцене, мистер Андерсон еще раз повернул шкафчик для зрителей, затем быстрыми движениями отодвинул висячие замки, распахнул дверь, и оттуда вышла красивая молодая ассистентка в просторном платье и большой шляпе.\n\nКаждый вечер, когда мистер Андерсон вызывал добровольцев, я с нетерпением ждал, когда меня выберут, и каждый вечер он проходил мимо. Я ужасно хотела быть избранной! Я хотел узнать, каково это-быть на сцене под светом фонарей, перед публикой. Я хотел быть рядом с мистером Андерсоном, когда он будет разыгрывать иллюзию. И мне определенно хотелось поближе взглянуть на то, как был построен кабинет. Конечно, я знал секрет современного кабинета, потому что к этому времени я уже изучил или разработал для себя механизм каждой тогдашней иллюзии. Секрет этой конкретной иллюзии заключается в создании шкафа.\n\nПосле последнего представления его короткого сезона я набрался храбрости и направился к выходу, намереваясь подойти к мистеру Андерсону, когда он выйдет из театра. Вместо этого я стоял снаружи не более минуты, когда швейцар вышел, чтобы поговорить со мной.\n\n- Прошу прощения, сэр, - сказал он. - Но мистер Андерсон распорядился, чтобы, если вы появитесь у этого входа, я пригласил Вас присоединиться к нему в гримерной.\n\nИзлишне говорить, что я был поражен!\n\n- Ты уверена, что он имел в виду меня? Я сказал.\n\n- Да, сэр. Я уверен\".\n\nВсе еще озадаченный, но чрезвычайно довольный и взволнованный, я последовал указаниям швейцара и вскоре нашел гримерную звезды. Внутри -\n\nВнутри последовало короткое, волнующее интервью с мистером Андерсоном.\n\nВозникли две темы, которые представляют определенный интерес.\n\nПервым было его объяснение, почему он никогда не выбирал меня из публики. Он сказал, что чуть было не выбрал меня на премьере, потому что я первым вскочил на ноги, но что-то заставило его передумать. Затем он сказал, что, увидев меня на последующих представлениях, понял, что я, должно быть, тоже фокусник (как мое сердце подпрыгнуло от радости при таком признании!), и поэтому неохотно пригласил меня принять участие. Он не знал, есть ли у меня тайные мотивы. Многие маги, особенно подрастающая молодежь, не гнушаются красть идеи у своих более авторитетных коллег, и поэтому я понимал осторожность мистера Андерсона. Тем не менее он извинился за то, что не доверяет мне.\n\nИз этого следовало второе: он понял, что я, должно быть, начинаю свою карьеру. Имея это в виду, он дал мне краткое рекомендательное письмо, которое должно было быть представлено в Сент-Джордж-Холле в Лондоне, где я смогу встретиться с самим мистером Невилом Маскелайном.\n\nПримерно через полгода после волнующей встречи с мистером Андерсоном я действительно обратился к мистеру Маскелайну в Лондоне, и именно после этого началась моя профессиональная карьера фокусника. Такова в общих чертах история моей встречи с мистером Андерсоном, а через него и с мистером Маскелайном.\n\nТеперь я вернусь к главному направлению этого повествования, что я и намеревался сделать, прежде чем прервать его.\n\nГЛАВА ПЯТАЯ.\n\nНесколько лет назад один волшебник (кажется, это был мистер Дэвид Девант) сказал: \"волшебники защищают свои секреты не потому, что они большие и важные, а потому, что они такие маленькие и тривиальные. Чудесные эффекты, создаваемые на сцене, часто являются результатом тайны настолько абсурдной, что магу было бы стыдно признаться, что именно так это и было сделано\".\n\nВот, в двух словах, парадокс сценического фокусника.\n\nТот факт, что трюк \"испорчен\", если его секрет раскрыт, широко понимается не только фокусниками, но и зрителями, которых они развлекают. Большинство людей наслаждаются ощущением таинственности, создаваемым спектаклем, и не хотят его портить.\n\nМаг, естественно, хочет сохранить свои секреты, чтобы продолжать зарабатывать на них себе на жизнь, и это широко признается. Однако он становится жертвой собственной скрытности. Чем дольше трюк входит в его репертуар, и чем чаще он успешно исполняется, и по определению чем большее число людей он обманул с его помощью, тем более ему кажется необходимым сохранить его тайну.\n\nЭффект нарастает. Его видят многие зрители, другие фокусники копируют или адаптируют его, сам фокусник позволит ему развиваться, так что его представление меняется с годами, делая трюк более невозможным для объяснения. Несмотря на все это, тайна остается. Он также остается маленьким и тривиальным, и по мере того, как эффект растет, тривиальность кажется более угрожающей его репутации. Секретность становится навязчивой идеей.\n\nИтак, к реальному предмету нашего разговора.\n\nЯ всю жизнь охранял свою тайну, делая вид, что шаркаю (я намекаю на Цзин Лин фу, а не пишу буквально). Сейчас я уже в том возрасте и, честно говоря, в том, что я заработал себе состояние, когда выступления на сцене утратили свое очарование. Поэтому я должен хромать образно до конца моей естественной жизни, чтобы сохранить свою тайну? Думаю, что нет, и поэтому я решил наконец изменить привычке всей жизни и написать о новом перенесенном человеке. Так называется иллюзия, сделавшая меня знаменитым. Многие говорили, что это величайшее волшебство, когда-либо исполнявшееся на международной сцене.\n\nЯ намерен написать, во-первых: краткое описание того, что видит аудитория.\n\nИ потом, во-вторых: раскрытие тайны, стоящей за этим!\n\nТакова цель этого рассказа. Теперь я отложил перо, как и было условлено.\n\nЯ воздерживался от написания этой книги в течение трех недель. Мне не нужно объяснять, почему; мне не нужно объяснять, почему. Тайна нового транспортированного человека не только моя, и ей конец. Какое безумие заражает меня?\n\nЭтот секрет служил мне много лет. Я провел большую часть своей жизни, защищая его. Разве это не достаточная причина для заключения договора?\n\nСогласно пакту, если я однажды делаю заявление, Я всегда беру на себя ответственность за него, как если бы я сам произнес эти слова. Как и я, когда роли меняются местами, во всяком случае, я всегда так считал. По этой причине я не настаиваю на том, чтобы вернуться назад и удалить те строки выше, где я обещаю раскрыть свою тайну. (По той же причине я не могу впоследствии удалить те самые строки, которые пишу сейчас.)\n\nОднако никакого раскрытия моей тайны, возможно, и не было сделано, и даже не должно быть рассмотрено снова. Я должен еще немного пошаркать.\n\nЯ игнорирую тот факт, что Руперт Энджер еще жив! Я действительно иногда выбрасываю его из головы,но негодяй продолжает дышать. Пока он жив, моя тайна в опасности.\n\nЯ слышал, что он все еще исполняет свою версию \" нового транспортированного человека \"и во время ее исполнения продолжает делать оскорбительное замечание через рампу, что то, что зрители собираются увидеть,\"часто копировалось, но никогда не улучшалось\". Энджер нашел новый способ транспортировки, и говорят, что он хорошо смотрится, когда выполняется. Его роковой недостаток, однако, заключается в том, что его эффект медленный. Он все еще не может проделать этот трюк так же быстро, как я! Как он хочет знать мою правду!\n\nПакт должен оставаться в силе. Никаких откровений!\n\nПоскольку Анжье был вовлечен в эту историю, я опишу проблему, которую он впервые поставил передо мной, и подробно расскажу, как начался наш спор. Скоро станет ясно, что вражду затеял я, и я беру на себя эту ответственность.\n\nОднако я сбился с пути, цепляясь за то, что считал высшими принципами, и когда понял, что сделал, попытался загладить свою вину\". Вот как это началось.\n\nКогда я только начал выступать, была мода на спиритические эффекты, или \"спиритизм\". Некоторые из этих представлений давались открыто на театральных подмостках; другие проходили более тайно в студиях или частных домах. У всех были общие черты. Они якобы давали надежду скорбящим, делая вид, что есть жизнь после смерти. Много денег перешло из рук в руки в погоне за этим утешением.\n\nСпиритизм имел две существенные черты. Во-первых, маги-духи использовали стандартные магические приемы. Во-вторых, они утверждали, что эффект был сверхъестественным. Другими словами, были сделаны ложные заявления о чудесных \"силах\".\n\nЭто меня раздражало. Все эти фокусы легко воспроизводил любой иллюзионист, и было раздражающе слышать, как их называют паранормальными явлениями, проявление которых, таким образом, \"доказывало\", что существует загробная жизнь, что духи могут ходить, что мертвые могут говорить и так далее. Это была ложь, но доказать ее было трудно.\n\nЯ приехал в Лондон в 1874 году. Под руководством Джона Генри Андерсона и под покровительством Невила Маскелайна я начал искать работу в театрах и мюзик-холлах по всей столице. Лондон был полон умных магов, и войти в круг было нелегко. Мне удалось занять скромное место в этом мире.\n\nВ это время духов-магов часто видели рекламирующими свои услуги в газетах и периодических изданиях, и некоторые из их деяний широко обсуждались. Спиритизм был представлен публике как более захватывающий, мощный и эффективный вид магии, чем то, что они могли видеть на сцене. Если кто-то достаточно искусен, чтобы ввести молодую женщину в транс и заставить ее парить в воздухе, почему бы не направить это умение с большей пользой и не общаться с недавно ушедшими? Почему не действительно?\n\nГЛАВА ШЕСТАЯ.\n\nИмя Руперта Энджера было мне уже знакомо. Он писал откуда-то из Северного Лондона в колонки писем двух или трех частных магических журналов. Энджер был самоуверенным и многословным корреспондентом. Его целью было осыпать презрением старых магов,которые с их скрытными манерами и вежливыми традициями считались утомительными пережитками прошлого. Хотя я работал в рамках этих традиций, я не участвовал в различных спорах Энджера, но некоторые из магов были сильно спровоцированы им.\n\nОдна из его теорий, например, состояла в том, что если маги так искусны, как они утверждают, то они должны быть готовы совершать магию \"в раунде\". То есть фокусник будет окружен со всех сторон зрителями. Он сказал, что магический эффект будет увеличен, если иллюзию можно будет рассмотреть со всех сторон. Во-вторых, если небольшой сегмент аудитории должен был заглянуть в тайну, это не имело значения! - Если пятьсот человек сбиты с толку, - сказал он, - то не важно, что еще пятеро узнают тайну.\n\nТакие теории были почти еретическими для большинства профессионалов, потому что отношение Энджера к магии было радикальным и безразличным к традициям, которые так долго сохранялись.\n\nТаким образом, Руперт Энджер делал себе имя, но, возможно, не то, которое планировал. Одно замечание, которое я часто слышал, было насмешливым удивлением, что Энджер редко выступал на публичной сцене. Поэтому его коллеги не могли восхищаться его, без сомнения, блестящей и новаторской магией.\n\nКак я уже сказал, Я не вмешивался, и он не представлял для меня большого интереса. Однако судьба вскоре изменила ситуацию.\n\nСлучилось так, что одна из сестер моего отца, жившая в Лондоне, недавно овдовела и в своем горе собиралась обратиться к спиритуалисту. Поэтому она устроила спиритический сеанс у себя дома. Мое профессиональное любопытство было возбуждено, поэтому я немедленно связался с тетей и вызвался быть с ней в поисках утешения.\n\nКогда наступил день, мне повезло, что тетя пригласила меня на ленч заранее, потому что спиритист прибыл в дом по крайней мере на час раньше, чем его ожидали. Это привело домочадцев в некоторое замешательство. Я думаю, что это было частью его плана и позволило ему сделать некоторые приготовления в комнате для сеанса. Он и двое его молодых помощников, мужчина и женщина, затемнили комнату черными шторами. Они отодвинули ненужную мебель в сторону, одновременно импортируя кое-что из своей собственной, откатали ковер, чтобы обнажить половицы, и соорудили деревянный шкаф, размеры и внешний вид которого были достаточны, чтобы убедить меня, что будет исполнена типичная сценическая магия. Во время этих приготовлений я оставался на заднем плане. Я не хотел быть интересным для спиритиста, потому что, если бы он был настороже, он мог бы узнать меня. На прошлой неделе мой сценический номер удался.\n\nСам спирит был молодым человеком примерно моего возраста, худощавым, с темными волосами и узким лбом. Он делал быстрые точные движения руками-верный признак давно практикующего престидигитатора. У молодой женщины, работавшей с ним, было стройное, гибкое тело и сильное, привлекательное лицо. Она носила темную скромную одежду и редко разговаривала. У второго помощника, мускулистого молодого человека, были светлые волосы и мрачное лицо.\n\nК тому времени, как прибыли другие гости моей тети, приготовления спиритистки были закончены.\n\nПрезентация длилась более часа, разбилась на три основные иллюзии, тщательно выстроенные таким образом, чтобы создать ощущение тревоги, возбуждения и внушаемости.\n\nСначала спиритист исполнил иллюзию опрокидывания стола с драматическим физическим эффектом; стол закружился сам по себе, а затем устрашающе встал на дыбы. После этого присутствующие дрожали от возбуждения и были готовы ко всему, что могло последовать. Затем с помощью своей ассистентки спиритист впал в транс. Его помощники связали ему руки и ноги и поместили в кабинет. Вскоре последовали многочисленные шумные, пугающие и необъяснимые паранормальные эффекты: ярко вспыхнули странные огни, зазвучали трубы, цимбалы и кастаньеты, и странная \"эктоплазматическая материя\" сама собой поднялась из сердца шкафа и вплыла в комнату, освещенную таинственным светом.\n\nЗатем спиритист приступил к своему главному делу. После короткого предупреждения об опасности \"перехода\" в мир духов, он связался с другой стороной. Вскоре он смог определить присутствие духа некоторых умерших родственников и близких друзей людей, собравшихся в комнате, и утешительные послания передавались от одной группы к другой.\n\nКак молодой спиритист достиг всего этого?\n\nВ силу профессиональной этики я не мог тогда и не могу сейчас раскрыть больше, чем в самых общих чертах, секретов магических эффектов.\n\nСтол для чаевых на самом деле вовсе не волшебный трюк. Малоизвестный физический феномен заключается в том, что если десять или двенадцать человек сгрудятся вокруг круглого деревянного стола, прижмут ладони к его поверхности, а затем им скажут, что скоро стол начнет вращаться, то это всего лишь вопрос минуты или двух, прежде чем это начнет происходить! Как только движение ощущается, стол начинает наклоняться то в одну, то в другую сторону. Искусно поставленная нога, внезапно поднимающая соответствующую ножку стола, резко нарушит равновесие стола, заставив его встать на дыбы.\n\nМне нет нужды подчеркивать, что стол, за которым сидела моя тетя, был одним из реквизитов самого спиритиста. Он был устроен так, что четыре деревянные ножки соединялись с центральной колонной таким образом, что под ними можно было просунуть ногу.\n\nОпытный маг может легко освободиться от пут, особенно если веревки и узлы были завязаны двумя помощниками. Как только он окажется внутри шкафа, ему потребуется несколько секунд, чтобы освободиться настолько, чтобы произвести паранормальные эффекты.\n\nЧто касается\" экстрасенсорных \" контактов, которые были главной целью встречи, то здесь тоже есть стандартные техники принуждения и подмены, которые с готовностью может выполнить любой хороший маг.\n\nЯ отправился в дом тети, чтобы удовлетворить профессиональное любопытство, но вместо этого, к своему стыду и сожалению, вышел оттуда с праведным негодованием. Стандартные сценические иллюзии использовались для того, чтобы одурачить группу внушаемых и уязвимых людей. Моя тетушка, полагая, что услышала слова утешения от своего любимого мужа, была так охвачена горем, что немедленно удалилась в свою комнату. Несколько других были почти так же глубоко тронуты услышанными сообщениями. И все же я знал, я один знал, что все это фальшивка.\n\nЯ чувствовал, что могу и должен разоблачить его как шарлатана, прежде чем он причинит еще какой-нибудь вред. Меня так и подмывало встретиться с ним лицом к лицу, но меня немного пугало то, как уверенно он исполнял свои иллюзии. Пока он и его помощница убирали свои приборы, я коротко поговорил с молодым человеком и получил визитную карточку спиритиста.\n\nТак я узнал имя и стиль человека, который затем пытался разрушить мою профессиональную карьеру:\n\nРуперт Энджер\n\nЯсновидящий, Духовный Медиум\n\nСоблюдается Строжайшая Секретность\n\n45 Idmiston Villas, Лондон N.\n\nЯ был молод, неопытен, вдохновлен тем, что считал высокими принципами, и они, к моему последнему разочарованию, ослепили меня от лицемерия моего положения. Я решил разоблачить проделки мистера Энджера. Вскоре мне удалось установить, где и когда должен был состояться его следующий сеанс.\n\nИ снова это была встреча в частном доме в пригороде Лондона, хотя на этот раз у меня не было никакой связи с семьей (скорбя о внезапной смерти матери). Я явился в дом накануне и сказал, что являюсь компаньоном Энджера, который попросил меня присутствовать. В их слишком очевидном горе оставшейся семье было все равно.\n\nНа следующий день я вышел на улицу задолго до назначенной встречи и таким образом смог убедиться, что ранний приезд Энджера в дом моей тети не был случайностью и действительно был необходимой частью приготовлений. Я тайком наблюдал, как он и его помощники распаковывают свое оборудование с тележки и несут его в дом. Когда час спустя, ближе к назначенному времени, я наконец появился в доме, комната была уже убрана и стояла в полутьме.\n\nСеанс начался, как и прежде, с трюка с опрокидыванием стола, и я стоял рядом с Энджером, пока он готовился начать.\n\n-Разве я вас не знаю, сэр? - сказал он тихо и обвиняюще.\n\n- Думаю, что нет, - ответил я.\n\n- У тебя это вошло в привычку, не так ли?\n\n-Не больше, чем вы, сэр, - ответил я.\n\nВсе ждали его, так что он должен был начать. Я думаю, что с этого момента он понял, что я здесь, чтобы разоблачить его, но он выполнил свое представление с той же элегантностью, которую я видел раньше.\n\nЯ хотел дождаться, когда эмоциональное напряжение достигнет максимума, когда будут посланы предполагаемые духовные послания. Энджер делал это с помощью маленьких клочков бумаги, скатанных в маленькие шарики. Семья раньше писала на этих клочках имена, предметы, семейные тайны и тому подобное, и Энджер делал вид, что читает их \"духовные\" послания, прижимая крошечные шарики ко лбу.\n\nКогда он начал, я ухватился за свой шанс. Я отошел от стола, разорвав цепочку рук, которая должна была создать психическое поле, и сорвал штору с ближайшего окна. В комнату хлынул дневной свет.\n\n- Какого дьявола  - начал Энджер.\n\n\"Дамы и господа\"! - Воскликнул я. \"Этот человек-самозванец\"!\n\n- Садитесь, сэр! Мужчина-ассистент быстро приближался ко мне.\n\n\"Он использует против тебя легерд\"! - Сказал Я решительно. - Посмотри на руку, которая прячется под поверхностью стола! Вот в чем секрет посланий, которые он вам приносит\"!\n\nКогда молодой человек обнял меня за плечи, я увидел, как Энджер быстро и виновато пытается спрятать клочок бумаги, который он держал в руках, и с помощью которого был проделан этот трюк. Отец семейства, полный ярости и горя, поднялся со своего места и начал громко ругать меня. Сначала один из детей, потом остальные заплакали от горя.\n\nПока я боролся, старший мальчик печально спросил: Где же мама? Она была здесь! Она была здесь\"!\n\n\"Этот человек-шарлатан, лжец и мошенник\"! - Крикнул я.\n\nК этому времени я был уже почти у двери, и меня вытолкнули из комнаты. Я увидел, как молодая женщина-ассистентка поспешила к окну, чтобы поставить штору. Мне удалось временно освободиться от своего агрессора, и я прыгнул на нее через всю комнату. Я схватил ее за плечи. Она упала на пол.\n\n\"Он не может говорить с мертвыми\"! - Воскликнул я. -Твоей матери здесь вообще нет!\n\nВ комнате поднялся шум.\n\n\"Держите его там\"! - Голос Энджера был слышен сквозь шум. Мужчина-ассистент схватил меня во второй раз и развернул так, чтобы я оказалась лицом к комнате. Молодая женщина все еще лежала на полу и с ненавистью смотрела на меня. Энджер, стоявший у стола, держался прямо и, казалось, был спокоен. Он смотрел прямо на меня.\n\n-Я знаю вас, сэр, - сказал он. -Я даже знаю твое проклятое имя. С этого момента я буду следить за вашей карьерой с величайшим вниманием\". Затем он сказал своему помощнику:\"уберите его отсюда\"!\n\nЧерез несколько мгновений я уже был снаружи. Я поправил одежду и быстро зашагал по улице.\n\nВ течение нескольких дней после этого я был уверен в правоте своего дела. Затем, неизбежно, у меня появились сомнения.\n\nКомфорт, который клиенты Энджера получали от сеансов, казался вполне искренним. Я вспомнил лица тех детей, которых на несколько минут заставили поверить, что их потерянная мать посылает утешительные послания с другой стороны. Я видел их невинные лица, их улыбки, их счастливые взгляды друг на друга.\n\nРазве все это так отличалось от той приятной мистификации, которую фокусник дает публике в мюзик-холле? В самом деле, не больше ли? Ожидание оплаты за это было более неприемлемо, чем ожидание оплаты за выступление в мюзик-холле?\n\nПолный сожалений, я горестно размышлял почти месяц, пока моя совесть не достигла такой глубины чувства вины,что я должен был действовать. Я написал записку Энджеру, умоляя о прощении, безоговорочно извиняясь.\n\nЕго реакция была мгновенной. Он вернул мою записку в клочьях, со своей собственной запиской, саркастически призывающей меня восстановить бумагу с помощью моей собственной высшей формы магии.\n\nДва дня спустя, когда я выступал в \"Люишем Эмпайр\", он встал из первого ряда и крикнул, чтобы все слышали:\"его ассистентка спрятана за занавеской в левой части кабинета\"!\n\nЭто, конечно, было правдой. Я должен был продолжить трюк, изобразить своего помощника с как можно большим театральным энтузиазмом, а затем опуститься перед смущенными аплодисментами. В центре первого ряда было свободное место.\n\nТак началась вражда, продолжавшаяся на протяжении многих лет.\n\nЯ могу сослаться только на молодость и неопытность, которые стали причиной вражды, на ложную профессиональную страсть, на незнание обычаев мира. Энджер должен был понести часть вины; мои извинения, хотя и не были достаточно быстрыми, были искренними, и их отказ был жестоким. Но ведь Энджер тоже был молод. Трудно вспоминать то время, потому что спор между нами продолжался так долго и принимал так много различных форм.\n\nМногие мои выступления провалились из-за его атак. Это может повредить моей репутации мага, и Энджер это прекрасно знал.\n\nОткуда мне было знать,что он стоит за ними? Ну, в некоторых случаях он явно заявлял о своей причастности; если бы одна из моих постановок была сорвана, он был бы там, в зале, и вскочил бы на ноги в тот самый момент, когда все пошло наперекосяк. Но что еще более важно, нападавший показал подход к магии, который, как я узнал, был симптомом Энджера. Его интересовала почти исключительно магическая тайна, то, что маги называют \"гимак\" или \"трюк\". Если трюк зависел от потайной полки за столом фокусника, то только это и привлекало внимание Энджера. Независимо от того, что еще могло вызвать конфликт между нами, в основе нашего спора лежало фундаментально ошибочное и ограниченное понимание энджером магической техники. Чудо магии заключается не в технической тайне, а в мастерстве, с которым она выполняется.\n\nИ именно по этой причине Новый транспортированный человек был единственной моей иллюзией, которую он никогда публично не атаковал. Это было выше его сил. Он просто не мог понять, как это делается, отчасти потому, что я хранил тайну в тайне, но главным образом из-за того, как я это делаю.\n\nГЛАВА СЕДЬМАЯ.\n\nИллюзия имеет три стадии.\n\nВо-первых, существует установка, в которой природа того, что может быть предпринято, намекается, или предлагается, или объясняется. Аппарат виден. В подготовке иногда принимают участие волонтеры из аудитории. Во время установки фокусник будет использовать все возможные способы дезориентации.\n\nПредставление-это то, где мастерство фокусника как исполнителя производит магическое представление.\n\nТретья стадия иногда называется эффектом, или престижем, и это продукт магии. Если кролика вытащить из шляпы, то кролика, которого, по-видимому, не существовало до того, как трюк был выполнен, можно назвать престижем этого трюка.\n\nНовый перенесенный человек довольно необычен среди иллюзий, потому что постановка и исполнение-это то, что больше всего интригует зрителей, критиков и моих коллег-магов, в то время как для меня, исполнителя, престиж-главная забота.\n\nМагия не имеет тайны для магов. То, что покажется аудитории новым или необъяснимым, - это просто технический вызов для других профессионалов. Если создается инновационная новая иллюзия, то это лишь вопрос времени, когда эффект будет воспроизведен другими.\n\nКаждая иллюзия может быть объяснена, например, использованием скрытого отсека, искусно размещенным зеркалом, помощником, помещенным в аудиторию в качестве \"добровольца\", или простым неправильным направлением внимания аудитории.\n\nНовый перенесенный человек-такая же иллюзия, как и все остальные, и ее можно объяснить. Но благодаря сочетанию простого секрета, который был надежно сохранен, многолетней практики, некоторого количества дезориентации аудитории и использования обычных магических техник он стал краеугольным камнем моего выступления и моей карьеры. Он также сопротивлялся всем попыткам Энджера проникнуть в его тайну, о чем я вскоре сообщу.\n\nМы с Сарой были с детьми в коротком отпуске на южном побережье, и я взяла с собой блокнот.\n\nМой первый комментарий к записной книжке состоит в том, что это я пытался унизить Энджера, а я, в свою очередь, был унижен им. Кроме этой детали, которая, в конце концов, не слишком важна, я думаю, что мой рассказ о том, что произошло, точен даже в других деталях.\n\nЯ не думаю, что мой секрет тривиален. Об этом легко догадаться, как это, по-видимому, сделал Энджер, несмотря на то, что я написал. Другие, вероятно, тоже догадались.\n\nО чем нельзя догадаться, так это о том, какое влияние эта тайна оказала на мою жизнь. Вот истинная причина, по которой Энджер никогда не разгадает всю тайну, если я сам не дам ему ответа. Он и представить себе не мог, до какой степени моя жизнь была направлена на то, чтобы сохранить тайну в неприкосновенности. Вот что важно.\n\nНовый перенесенный человек-это иллюзия, внешность которой с годами менялась, но метод всегда оставался тем же.\n\nОна постепенно включала в себя два шкафа, или два ящика, или два стола, или две скамьи. Один расположен в нижней части сцены,другой-на верхней. Единственной важной особенностью их расположения является то, что обе части должны быть четко и широко отделены друг от друга. Аппарат ярко освещен и находится на виду у зрителей от начала до конца.\n\nЯ опишу самый старый и, следовательно, самый простой вариант трюка, когда я использовал закрытые шкафы. В то время я называл иллюзию перенесенным человеком.\n\nОба шкафа выносятся на сцену, и оба оказываются пустыми. Добровольцам разрешается их осматривать. Затем шкафы закрываются.\n\nПосле короткой шутливой преамбулы (произнесенной с моим французским акцентом) о том, что желательно быть в двух местах одновременно, я подхожу к ближайшему из двух шкафов, первому, и открываю дверь.\n\nОн, конечно, все еще пуст. Я беру со стола большой, ярко раскрашенный надувной мяч и пару раз подпрыгиваю, чтобы показать, как энергично он движется. Я вхожу в первый шкаф, оставляя дверь открытой.\n\nЯ бросаю мяч в сторону второго шкафа.\n\nИзнутри я захлопнул дверцу первого шкафа.\n\nИзнутри я толкаю дверь второго шкафа и выхожу. Я ловлю мяч, когда он отскакивает в мою сторону.\n\nКогда мяч попадает в мои руки, первый шкаф рушится, дверь и три стены резко складываются, чтобы показать, что он совершенно пуст.\n\nДержа мяч, я делаю шаг вперед к рампе и принимаю аплодисменты.\n\nГЛАВА ВОСЬМАЯ.\n\nПозвольте мне вкратце рассказать о своей жизни и карьере вплоть до последних лет века.\n\nК тому времени, когда мне исполнилось 18, я ушел из дома и работал в мюзик-холлах в качестве штатного фокусника. Однако даже с помощью Мистера Маскелайна найти работу было нелегко, и я не стал ни знаменитым, ни богатым и не заработал себе места на счете в течение нескольких лет. В основном я помогал другим магам с их выступлениями, но долгое время я оплачивал аренду, проектируя и строя шкафы и другие магические приборы. Мне очень помогло обучение отца столярному делу. Я приобрел репутацию надежного изобретателя и изобретателя сценических иллюзий.\n\nВ 1879 году умерла моя мать, а через год-отец.\n\nК концу 1880-х годов, когда мне было чуть за тридцать, я разработал свой собственный сольный номер и принял сценическое имя Le Professeur de la Magie. Я регулярно исполнял \"транспортированного человека\" в его различных ранних формах.\n\nХотя работа иллюзии никогда не была проблемой, я долгое время был недоволен сценическими эффектами. Мне всегда казалось, что закрытые кабинеты не настолько таинственны, чтобы вызывать у зрителей ожидания опасности и невозможности. В 1892 году, однако, пришла идея, которую я искал. Это произошло косвенно, и семя, которое оно посеяло, долго развивалось.\n\nБалканский изобретатель по имени Никола Тесла приехал в Лондон в феврале того же года, чтобы продвигать некоторые новые эффекты, которые он тогда был пионером в области электричества. Тесла собирался прочесть несколько лекций о своей специальности перед научным сообществом. Оказалось, что г-н Тесла был противоречивой фигурой в США, вовлеченной в научные споры о природе и применении электричества, и о нем было много сообщений в газетах. Именно из этих статей я черпал свои идеи.\n\nМне всегда был нужен эффектный сценический эффект, отчасти для того, чтобы подчеркнуть эффект перенесенного человека, а отчасти для того, чтобы замаскировать его действие. Из новостей я узнал, что Мистер Тесла способен генерировать высокое напряжение, которое можно заставить вспыхивать и искриться, не причиняя вреда и не причиняя ожогов.\n\nПосле того как Мистер Тесла вернулся в Соединенные Штаты, Лондон и другие города начали поставлять небольшое количество электроэнергии тем, кто мог позволить себе ее купить. Некоторое время спустя, когда я услышал, что Энджер собирается подражать перенесенному человеку, я начал думать, что должен развить иллюзию еще раз. Я понял, что без особого труда смогу применить электричество для своих нужд, и начал поиски через лондонских научных дилеров. С помощью Томми Элборна, моего изобретателя, мне в конце концов удалось построить сценическое оборудование для нового транспортированного человека. Моя иллюзия сработала в ослепительной вспышке электрического света.\n\nТеперь я вернусь. В октябре 1891 года я женился на Саре Хендерсон, с которой познакомился, когда принимал участие в благотворительном шоу в общежитии Армии Спасения в Олдгейте. Она была одной из добровольных помощниц и во время антракта нашего представления сидела со мной в неформальной обстановке, пока мы оба пили чай. Мои карточные фокусы позабавили ее, и она, поддразнивая, предложила мне сыграть еще несколько для нее одной, чтобы она могла посмотреть, как я это делаю. Поскольку она была молода и хороша собой, я так и сделал, и мне очень понравилось недоумение, которое я увидел в ее глазах.\n\nЭто был первый и последний раз, когда я творил для нее магию. Мое мастерство престидигитатора просто перестало иметь отношение к нашим чувствам друг к другу. Вскоре после нашей встречи мы стали гулять вместе и вскоре признались друг другу в любви. У Сары нет опыта ни в театре, ни в мюзик-холлах. На самом деле она была молодой женщиной благородного происхождения. Она доказала мне свою преданность: даже после того, как отец пригрозил лишить ее наследства, что, конечно, в конце концов и произошло, она осталась верна мне.\n\nПосле нашей свадьбы мы переехали в съемные комнаты в районе Бейсуотер в Лондоне, но нам не пришлось долго ждать, прежде чем я добился успеха. В 1893 году мы купили большой дом в Сент-Джонс-Вуд, где и живем с тех пор. В том же году родились наши дети-близнецы Грэм и Хелена.\n\nЯ всегда отделял свою профессиональную жизнь от семейной. В описываемый период я практиковал свою профессию в офисе и мастерской на Элджин-авеню, и когда гастролирующие шоу брали меня за границу или в отдаленные части Британии, Я не брал с собой Сару. Когда я бывал в Лондоне или в перерывах между выступлениями, я жил с ней тихо и спокойно.\n\nЯ подчеркиваю свою довольную домашнюю жизнь из-за того, что вскоре произошло.\n\nМне продолжать?\n\nЯ думаю, что должен; да. Я подозреваю, что знаю, о чем говорю.\n\nЯ давал объявления в театральных журналах о смене ассистентки, потому что моя нынешняя молодая женщина, Джорджина Харрис, собиралась выйти замуж. Я всегда боялся неприятностей, вызванных появлением нового сотрудника, особенно такого важного, как ассистент сцены. Когда Олив Уэнскомб написала и подала заявление на собеседование, она не сразу оказалась подходящей кандидатурой, и ее письмо некоторое время оставалось без ответа.\n\nВ письме она писала, что ей двадцать шесть. Это было немного старше, чем я хотел. Она описала себя как обученную танцовщицу, которая перешла на работу магического помощника. Я всегда предпочитал нанимать молодых женщин с особым магическим опытом, а не тех, кто брался за него просто потому, что им когда-то предлагали работу. Тем не менее письмо Олив Уэнскомб пришло в один из тех периодов, когда хороших помощников найти было трудно, и я наконец договорился с ней о встрече.\n\nИнтервью Олив Уэнскомб состоялось в моей мастерской на Элджин-Авеню. Здесь, в открытых шкафах, зеркальных кубах и занавешенных нишах, были раскрыты многие случайные секреты моего бизнеса. Но единственной иллюзией, чью тайну я тщательно оберегал, был новый перенесенный человек, и ее действие было скрыто даже от молодой женщины, которая делила со мной сцену до того момента, пока иллюзия не началась.\n\nЯ работаю не совсем один, как и любой современный иллюзионист. Помимо моих ассистентов на сцене работал Томас Элборн, мой незаменимый ingenieur, и два его собственных молодых мастера, которые помогали ему строить и обслуживать аппарат. Томас был со мной почти с самого начала.\n\n(Томас Элборн знал мою самую охраняемую тайну; он должен был знать. Но я доверяла ему, я должна была. Я говорю это как можно проще, чтобы передать простоту моей веры в него. Томас всю жизнь работал с магами, и больше его ничто не удивляло. Я многому у него научился. И все же он ни разу не раскрыл тайну другого мага ни мне, ни кому - либо еще, за все годы, что я работал с ним-он ушел в отставку несколько лет назад. Поставить под сомнение его доверие значило бы поставить под сомнение мое здравомыслие. Томас был лондонцем из Тоттенхэма, женатым человеком без детей. Он был на много лет старше меня, но я так и не узнал, на сколько именно. Когда Олив Уэнскомб начала работать на меня, ему было около семидесяти.)\n\nЯ решил нанять Олив Уэнскомб, как только она приедет. Она не была ни высокой, ни широкой, но обладала привлекательным и стройным телом. Она держала голову прямо, когда шла или стояла, и ее лицо имело четко очерченные черты. Она родилась в Америке, с акцентом, который она определила как восточный берег, но жила и работала в Лондоне в течение нескольких лет. Я как можно непринужденнее представил ее Томасу Элборну и Джорджине Харрис, а затем спросил, не привезла ли она с собой какие-нибудь рекомендации. Обычно я придавал большое значение рекомендациям, оценивая кандидата, потому что рекомендация от мага, чью работу я знал, почти наверняка принесла бы соискателю работу. Олив принесла с собой два таких упоминания: одно-от мага, имени которого я не знал, а другое-от Жозефа Буатье де Кольта, одного из величайших ныне живущих артистов. Признаюсь, я был впечатлен. Я молча передал письмо де колты Томасу Элборну и стал наблюдать за выражением его лица.\n\n-Как долго вы работали у господина де Кольта? - Спросил я ее.\n\n- Только на пять месяцев, - сказала она. - Меня наняли в турне по Европе,и в конце он меня отпустил.\n\n\"Так я вижу\".\n\nПосле этого нанять ее было чем-то вроде формальности, но даже так я подвергал ее обычным испытаниям.\n\n- Вы привезли с собой репетиционный костюм? Я сказал.\n\n-Да, сэр, я так и сделал.\n\n-Тогда, если вы будете так добры -\"\n\nОлив Уэнскомб оказалась самой подходящей кандидатурой по всем обычным критериям, и я оставил ее на обычное жалованье. В течение недели я научил ее играть во всех иллюзиях моего репертуара, где она будет нужна. Вскоре Джорджина вышла замуж за своего поклонника, и Олив заняла ее место в качестве моей постоянной помощницы.\n\nКаким аккуратным все это кажется, когда я записываю, каким спокойным и профессиональным! Теперь, когда я написал \"официальную\" версию Олив, позвольте мне в соответствии с нашим договором добавить правду, которую я до сих пор скрывал от всех, кто имеет для меня наибольшее значение. Оливия чуть не выставила меня дураком, и надо дать ей истинный отчет.\n\nДжорджины на допросе, разумеется, не было. Не бы и я. Томми Элборн тоже был там, но, как всегда, держался в стороне. Мы с ней были одни в моей мастерской.\n\nЯ спросил Олив о костюме, и она ответила, что не взяла его с собой. Сказав это, она посмотрела мне прямо в глаза, и воцарилось долгое молчание, пока я размышлял о том, что это значит. Ни одна молодая женщина, претендующая на эту работу, не ожидает, что ее возьмут на работу, не пройдя какой-либо проверки. Абитуриенты всегда приносили с собой репетиционный костюм.\n\nНу, Олив, по-видимому, нет. Потом она сказала:\"мне не нужен костюм, милый\".\n\nОна быстро сняла верхнюю одежду, и то, что было надето под ней, принадлежало будуару; она осталась в одежде, которая была нескромной. Я подвел ее к Паланкину, где, хотя она, очевидно, знала, что это такое и где ей нужно спрятаться, она попросила меня помочь ей забраться внутрь. Это требовало очень интимного обращения с ее полуодетым телом! То же самое произошло, когда я показал ей механизм другого трюка. Она притворилась, что споткнулась, и упала в мои объятия. Остальная часть интервью проходила на диване в задней части мастерской. Томми Элборн тихо ушел, никто из нас этого не заметил. Во всяком случае, потом его там не было.\n\nОстальное в основном верно. Я взял ее на работу, и она научилась управлять всеми иллюзиями, в которых я нуждался.\n\nГЛАВА ДЕВЯТАЯ.\n\nМое выступление всегда начинается с китайских связующих колец. Зрители любят смотреть его, независимо от того, видели ли они его раньше. Этот трюк невозможно увидеть насквозь, если только вы не стоите в нескольких дюймах от исполнителя и не можете отобрать у него кольца. Это всегда очаровывает, всегда создает то электризующее чувство тайны и чуда.\n\nЗатем я выкатываю вперед современный шкаф, который стоял на сцене. Примерно в ярде от рампы я поворачиваю шкаф, чтобы показать обе стороны и заднюю часть. Я открываю дверь, чтобы показать интерьер, затем шагаю внутрь, чтобы отпустить защелку, которая удерживает заднюю панель на месте, зрители могут видеть все спереди и сзади. Они видят, как я прохожу и снова закрываю заднюю стену. Дверь распахнута настежь, и пока я, по-видимому, хлопочу за шкафом, они пристальнее всматриваются внутрь. Затем я быстро захлопываю входную дверь, поворачиваю шкаф и распахиваю дверь. Внутри, красиво одетая, улыбающаяся и размахивающая руками, целиком заполняющая интерьер кабинета, стоит молодая женщина. Она спускается, кланяется под громкие аплодисменты и уходит со сцены.\n\nЯ откатываю шкаф в сторону сцены, и Томас Элборн тихонько откатывает его обратно за занавес.\n\nИтак, к следующему. Каждый магический акт включает в себя несколько мгновений с колодой карт. Фокусник должен демонстрировать свое мастерство с ловкостью рук, иначе его профессиональные коллеги могут подумать, что он просто оператор самодействующего механизма. Я подхожу к рампе, и шторы закрываются за мной. Отчасти это делается для того, чтобы создать закрытую, интимную атмосферу для карточных фокусов, но главным образом для того, чтобы за ними Томас мог установить аппарат для нового транспортируемого человека.\n\nПокончив с картами, я принимаю аплодисменты.\n\nВ то время как зрители все еще хлопают, занавеси за моей спиной раздвигаются, и в полумраке виден мой аппарат для нового перенесенного человека.\n\nЗатем я обращаюсь непосредственно к аудитории на своем английском с французским акцентом. Я объясняю, что то, что я собираюсь сделать, стало возможным только после открытия электричества. Спектакль черпает силу из недр Земли. Действуют невообразимые силы, которые даже я не вполне понимаю. Я объясняю, что сейчас они станут свидетелями настоящего чуда, в котором жизнь и смерть имеют равные шансы.\n\nПока я говорю, огни сцены вспыхивают ярче и ловят отполированные металлические опоры, золотые витки проволоки, блестящие стеклянные шары. Аппарат-вещь прекрасная, но красота угрожающая, потому что все уже слышали о какой-то смертельной силе электрического тока. Газеты писали об ужасных смертях и ожогах, вызванных новой силой, уже имевшейся во многих городах.\n\nАппарат нового транспортируемого человека предназначен для того, чтобы напоминать им об этих счетах. Он несет множество светящихся электрических ламп, некоторые из которых загораются, пока я говорю. С одной стороны-большой стеклянный шар, внутри которого шипит и потрескивает сверкающая электрическая дуга. Основная часть аппарата представляется зрителям длинной деревянной скамьей, возвышающейся на три фута над полом сцены. Они могут видеть за ним, вокруг него, под ним. В одном конце, у освещенной дугой стеклянной камеры, находится небольшая приподнятая платформа с подвешенными проводами. Над платформой навес с множеством ярких ламп. В дальнем конце находится металлический конус, украшенный спиралью из небольших светящихся ламп. Он установлен на устройстве, которое позволяет вращать его в нескольких направлениях. Все это производит громкий гудящий шум.\n\nЯ объясняю зрителям, что пригласил бы некоторых из них на сцену, чтобы они сами осмотрели устройство, если бы не огромная опасность для них. Я намекаю на более ранние несчастные случаи. Вместо этого, говорю я, я сделал несколько простых демонстраций силы внутри машины. Я позволяю какому-то порошку магния упасть на два оголенных контакта, и яркая белая вспышка на мгновение ослепляет зрителей, находящихся ближе всего к сцене! Пока дым от него поднимается вверх, я беру лист бумаги и бросаю его на другую полускрытую часть аппарата; это немедленно вспыхивает пламенем,и его дым также резко поднимается. Гудящий звук становится громче. Аппарат кажется живым, только едва сдерживая страшные энергии, которые лежат внутри.\n\nЗатем появляется моя помощница с ящиком на колесиках. Он прочно сделан из дерева, но поскольку он построен на колесах, она может поворачивать его так, чтобы его было видно со всех сторон. Затем она опускает переднюю и боковые части, чтобы показать, что она пуста.\n\nЯ печально гримасничаю, глядя на публику, затем подаю знак девушке, которая приносит мне две большие темно-коричневые перчатки, сделанные, казалось бы, из кожаного материала. Когда они покрывают мои руки, она ведет меня к аппарату, пока я не встаю за ним. Зрители все еще могут видеть большую часть моего тела и убедиться, что там нет скрытых зеркал или щитов . Я опускаю обе руки в перчатках на поверхность платформы, и по мере того, как я делаю это, звук электрического напряжения усиливается, и появляется еще один блестящий разряд электрической энергии. Я отшатываюсь, словно в шоке.\n\nЯ прошу девушку покинуть сцену ради ее же безопасности. Сначала она сопротивляется, потом радостно спешит прочь.\n\nЯ протягиваю руку к вращающемуся конусу, осторожно хватаю его руками в перчатках и осторожно двигаю, пока он не оказывается направленным прямо на шкаф.\n\nИллюзия приближается к своей кульминации. Из оркестровой ямы доносится барабанная дробь. Я снова кладу обе руки на платформу, и волшебным образом все оставшиеся лампы ярко вспыхивают. Сначала я сажусь на платформу и поворачиваюсь так, чтобы можно было вытянуть ноги, затем опускаюсь, пока не оказываюсь во всю длину в ужасных электрических силах.\n\nЯ поднимаю руки и стягиваю сначала одну, потом другую перчатку. Опуская руки, я позволяю им опуститься ниже уровня платформы.\n\nЯркая, ослепительная вспышка света, и все огни на аппарате сливаются во тьму.\n\nВ то же мгновение... Я исчезаю с платформы.\n\nШкаф распахивается, и меня видят внутри, сгорбленного.\n\nЯ медленно выкатываюсь из шкафа и падаю на пол. Я купаюсь в огнях сцены. Постепенно я прихожу в себя. Я встаю. Я моргаю от яркого света. Я смотрю на публику. Я поворачиваюсь к платформе, указываю, где я был, поворачиваюсь к шкафу сразу за мной и указываю, куда я прибыл.\n\nЯ беру свой лук.\n\nЗрители видели, как я превращаюсь. На их глазах меня катапультировало силой электричества с одной части сцены на другую. Десять футов пустого пространства. Двадцать футов, тридцать футов, в зависимости от размера сцены.\n\nЧеловеческое тело передается в одно мгновение. Чудо, невозможность, иллюзия.\n\nМой помощник возвращается на сцену. Сжимая ее руку, я улыбаюсь и кланяюсь, когда раздаются аплодисменты и занавес закрывается передо мной.\n\nЕсли я больше ничего не скажу, это будет приемлемо. Я больше не буду вмешиваться. Я могу продолжать до конца.\n\nГЛАВА ДЕСЯТАЯ.\n\nЖизнь в моей квартире в Хорнси, районе на севере Лондона, в нескольких милях от моего дома в Сент-Джонс-Вуд, оставляла желать лучшего. Я выбрал квартиру, одну из десяти в многоквартирном доме в тихом переулке, просто потому, что ее анонимность удовлетворяла мои потребности. Он находился на втором этаже в задней части скромного здания середины века, занимая один из углов, так что, хотя в нем было несколько окон, выходящих в окружающий небольшой сад, вход в него был через единственную простую дверь, ведущую с лестницы.\n\nВскоре я начал жалеть о своем выборе. Большинство других жильцов были семьями низшего среднего класса; во всех других квартирах на моем этаже жили дети. Мое одиночество, особенно в квартире такого размера, явно возбуждало любопытство соседей. В конце концов, мне кажется, я стал им скучен. Англичане традиционно терпимо относятся к эксцентричным людям, и мои ночные визиты, мое одинокое присутствие без слуг, мой необъяснимый способ зарабатывать себе на жизнь в конце концов стали казаться безобидными.\n\nЯ снял квартиру без мебели и, поскольку большую часть своего заработка тратил на семейный дом в Сент-Джонс-Вуд, поначалу мог позволить себе только дешевую и неудобную мебель. Но хуже всего было одиночество и чувство оторванности от семьи. От этого никогда не было лекарства, ни тогда, ни сейчас. Даже поначалу, когда меня разлучили только с Сарой, Это было невыносимо. После рождения Грэма и Хелены стало еще труднее, особенно когда одна из них заболела. Хотя я знала, что о моей семье заботятся с любовью, а наши слуги преданны и заслуживают доверия, этого всегда было недостаточно.\n\nВ те годы, когда я планировал транспортированного человека и мою общую магическую карьеру, мне никогда не приходило в голову, что наличие семьи может однажды угрожать сделать ее неосуществимой.\n\nМного раз я испытывал искушение оставить сцену, и всегда потому, что чувствовал призывы любви и долга к моей прекрасной жене и любви к моим детям.\n\nВ те долгие дни в Хорнси-флэт, а иногда и в те недели, когда театральный сезон не давал мне возможности выступить, у меня было много времени на размышления.\n\nГлавное, конечно, то, что я не сдавался.\n\nЯ продолжал переживать трудные ранние годы. Я продолжал работать, когда моя репутация и доходы начали расти. И я продолжаю идти теперь, когда большая часть того, что осталось от моей знаменитой иллюзии, - это тайна, которая ее окружает.\n\nОднако в последнее время все стало намного проще. В течение первых двух недель, что Олив Уэнскомб работала на меня, я обнаружил, что она остановилась в коммерческом отеле. Объяснив почему, она сказала мне, что гемпширский маг предоставил ей жилье, но она отказалась от него, когда ушла с его работы. К этому времени мы с Оливией уже регулярно пользовались кушеткой в задней части моей мастерской, и я понял, что моя работа тоже может предложить ей постоянное жилье.\n\nПакт контролировал все решения такого рода, но в данном случае это была просто формальность. Через несколько дней Олив переехала в мою квартиру в Хорнси. Там она и осталась, и остается до сих пор.\n\nЕе откровение, изменившее все, пришло через несколько недель.\n\nК концу 1898 года театральная отмена означала, что между выступлениями нового \"транспортированного человека\" оставалось больше недели. Я провел это время в квартире Хорнси с Олив. Мы начали делать ремонт в квартире и купили несколько привлекательных предметов мебели.\n\nВ ночь перед тем, как идиллия должна была закончиться - я планировал взять свое шоу на ипподром в Брайтоне, - она удивилась. Была поздняя ночь, и мы отдыхали вместе, прежде чем заснуть.\n\n\"Послушай, милая\"! - сказала она. -Я подумал, что ты, возможно, захочешь начать искать нового помощника.\n\nЯ был так поражен, что сначала не знал, что ответить. До этого момента мне казалось, что я достиг той стабильности, к которой стремился всю свою трудовую жизнь. У меня была семья, была любовница. Я жил в своем доме с женой и жил в своей квартире с любовником. Я боготворил своих детей, обожал свою жену, любил свою любовницу. Моя жизнь состояла из двух отдельных половин, разделенных друг от друга; ни одна из сторон даже не подозревала о существовании другой. Кроме того, мой возлюбленный работал моим прекрасным и очаровательным ассистентом на сцене. Она не только блестяще справлялась со своей работой, но и ее прекрасная внешность, я был уверен, несомненно, помогла мне завоевать гораздо большую аудиторию, перед которой я играл с тех пор, как она присоединилась ко мне. Теперь, с этими словами, Олив, казалось, вывела все из равновесия, и я был повергнут в смятение.\n\nУвидев мою реакцию, Олив сказала: \"Я хочу многое сбросить с себя. Все не так плохо, как ты думаешь\".\n\n-Не представляю, что может быть хуже.\n\n-Ну, если ты услышишь половину того, что я скажу, это будет хуже, чем ты когда-либо себе представлял, но если ты услышишь все, я думаю, тебе будет хорошо. Я внимательно посмотрел на нее и заметил, что она напряжена. История выплеснулась потоком слов, быстро подтвердив ее предупреждение. То, что она сказала, наполнило меня ужасом.\n\nОна начала с того, что сказала, что хочет прекратить работать на меня по двум причинам. Во-первых, она просто хотела перемен. Она сказала, что хочет жить дома, быть моей любовницей, следить за моей карьерой с этой точки зрения. Она сказала, что будет продолжать работать моим помощником, пока я не попрошу ее об этом или пока я не найду замену. Пока все хорошо. Но, сказала она, я еще не слышала второй причины. Дело в том, что ее прислал ко мне человек, который хотел узнать мои профессиональные секреты. Этот человек -\n\n\"Это Энджер\"! - Воскликнул я. - Тебя послал шпионить за мной Руперт Энджер?\n\nВ этом она охотно призналась и, видя мой гнев, отодвинулась от меня и заплакала. Мой разум лихорадочно работал, когда я пытался вспомнить все, что говорил ей в предыдущие недели, и вспомнить, какой аппарат она видела или использовала, какие секреты она могла узнать или открыть для себя, и что она смогла сообщить моему врагу.\n\nКакое-то время я не мог ее слушать, не мог спокойно и логично рассуждать. Почти все это время она плакала, умоляя меня выслушать ее.\n\nДва или три часа прошли в этом тягостном и непродуктивном состоянии, и наконец мы достигли точки эмоционального оцепенения. Потребность во сне заставила нас выключить свет. Мы легли вместе: наши привычки еще не были сломлены страшным откровением.\n\nЯ лежал без сна в темноте, пытаясь придумать, как справиться с этим, но мой разум все еще рассеянно кружился. Затем из темноты рядом со мной я услышал, как она тихо, настойчиво сказала: \"Неужели ты не понимаешь, что если бы я все еще была шпионом Руперта Энджера, то не сказала бы тебе? Да, я была с ним, но мне было с ним скучно. И он развлекался с какой-то другой дамой, и это меня раздражало. Все это время он был одержим идеей напасть на тебя, а мне нужна была перемена, и поэтому я сам придумал эту идею. Но когда я встретил тебя ... ну, я чувствовал себя по-другому. Ты так не похожа на Руперта во всем. Ты ведь знаешь, что произошло, и все, что было между нами на самом деле, верно? Руперт думает, что я шпионила для него, но, думаю, он уже понял, что ничего от меня не услышит. Я хочу перестать быть твоей ассистенткой, потому что пока я там, наверху, играю с тобой, Руперт ждет, когда я сделаю то, что он хочет.\n\nЯ просто хочу выбраться из всего этого, жить здесь, в этой квартире, быть с тобой, Альфред. Знаешь, мне кажется, я люблю тебя -\"\n\nИ так до глубокой ночи.\n\nУтром, в сером свете дождливого рассвета, я сказал ей: \"я решил, что делать. Почему бы тебе не передать сообщение Энджеру? Я скажу тебе, что сказать, и ты передашь ему это, сказав, что это тайна, которую он искал. Вы можете говорить все, что хотите, чтобы он поверил, что вы украли у меня секрет и что это самая важная информация, которую он искал. После этого, если ты вернешься и поклянешься, что никогда больше не будешь иметь ничего общего с Энджером, и если, и только если, ты сможешь заставить меня поверить тебе, тогда мы снова начнем нашу совместную жизнь. Вы согласны?\"\n\n-Я сделаю это сегодня, - поклялась она. -Я хочу навсегда вычеркнуть Энджер из своей жизни!\n\n- Сначала мне нужно в мастерскую. Я должен решить, что я могу спокойно сказать Энджеру\".\n\nБез дальнейших объяснений я оставил ее в квартире и сел в омнибус на Элджин-Авеню.\n\nКогда я пришел на семинар, проблема была полностью обсуждена. Хотя потенциально серьезный, это был всего лишь один из нескольких кризисов, с которыми пакту приходилось сталкиваться на протяжении многих лет. Это было нелегко, но в конце концов пакт был так же силен, как и всегда. В самом деле, как свидетельство моей неизменной веры в пакт, я могу сказать, что именно я остался в мастерской, когда вернулся в квартиру.\n\nЗдесь я продиктовал Олив, что она должна написать на листе бумаги своим почерком. Она записала его, напряженная, но полная решимости сделать то, что считала необходимым. Сообщение предназначалось для того, чтобы направить Энджера в неверном направлении, поэтому оно должно было быть не только правдоподобным, но и таким, о чем он сам бы не подумал.\n\nОна ушла от Хорнси с сообщением в 14 25 и вернулась домой только после 11 00.\n\n\"Дело сделано\"! - воскликнула она. -У него есть информация, которую я ему дал. Я надеюсь, что никогда больше не увижу его и, конечно, никогда больше не скажу о нем ни одного дружеского слова\".\n\nЯ никогда не спрашивал, что произошло за те восемь с половиной часов, что она отсутствовала, и почему ей потребовалось так много времени, чтобы доставить письменное сообщение. Она простодушно объяснила, что не сразу нашла Энджера: он был на спектакле в другой части города. Вероятно, это правда. Но в тот долгий вечер у меня было много мрачных фантазий о двойных агентах.\n\nОднако все это произошло в конце 1898 года, и я пишу эти слова в конце исторического месяца января 1901 года. (За день до того, как я написал эти слова, Ее Величество Королева была наконец похоронена, и страна, наконец, выходит из периода траура.) Олив остается со мной, верная моим желаниям. Моя карьера идет гладко, мое положение в мире иллюзий прочно, моя семья растет, мое богатство надежно. Я управляю двумя мирными семьями. Руперт Энджер не нападал на меня с тех пор, как Олив передала ему ложную информацию. Вокруг меня все спокойно, и после бурных лет я наконец-то устроился в своей жизни.\n\nГЛАВА ОДИННАДЦАТАЯ.\n\nПишу, неохотно, в 1903 году. Я планировал навсегда оставить свой блокнот закрытым, но события обернулись против меня.\n\nРуперт Энджер скоропостижно скончался. Ему было сорок шесть, всего на год младше меня. Его смерть, Согласно сообщению в \"Таймс\", была вызвана осложнениями после травм, полученных во время представления сценической иллюзии в театре в Саффолке.\n\nЯ уже подозревал, что он болен. Когда я видел его в последний раз, он был слаб, и я предположил, что он стал жертвой какого-то хронического недуга.\n\nЯ могу подвести итог опубликованным некрологам,которые я имею перед собой, когда пишу. Он родился в Дербишире в 1857 году, но в юном возрасте переехал в Лондон, где много лет работал иллюзионистом и престидигитатором, добившись значительного успеха. Он выступал на Британских островах и в Европе, трижды объездил Новый Свет. Ему приписывали изобретение нескольких выдающихся сценических иллюзий, в частности одной под названием \"яркое утро\" (она включала в себя освобождение ассистента из чего-то похожего на запечатанную колбу, которую держали на виду у зрителей), и это было широко имитировано. Совсем недавно он успешно изобрел иллюзию под названием \"В мгновение ока\", которую он исполнял во время смертельного несчастного случая. Мастер легерд, Энджер был популярным исполнителем на небольших или частных собраниях. Он был женат, имел сына и двух дочерей и до конца жизни жил со своей семьей в районе Хайгейт в Лондоне. Он регулярно выступал до несчастного случая, который привел к его смерти.\n\nГЛАВА 12.\n\nМне не доставляет удовольствия писать о смерти Энджера. Это стало трагической кульминацией череды событий, которые накапливались более двух лет.\n\nКак я уже отмечал в предыдущей части этого дневника, я достиг состояния приятного равновесия и стабильности в своей жизни и карьере и не желал ничего большего, чем то, что имел в то время. Я чувствовал и искренне верил, что если Энджер нападет на меня, я просто проигнорирую его. В самом деле, у меня были все основания полагать, что след ложных улик, предложенный ему в записке Олив, был заключительным действием между нами. Это должно было сбить его с курса, заставить искать тайну, которой не существовало. Тот факт, что он исчез из моего сознания более чем на два года, говорил о том, что мой трюк сработал.\n\nОднако вскоре после того, как я закончил первую часть этого повествования, я прочитал журнальный обзор шоу, проходившего в Империи Финсбери-Парк. Одним из них был Руперт Энджер. В заметке о нем упоминалось лишь мимоходом, замечая, что \"приятно сознавать, что его талант остается незамутненным\". Это само по себе говорило о том, что в его карьере наступила пауза.\n\nДва или три месяца спустя все изменилось. Один из магических журналов опубликовал интервью с ним. Одна из ежедневных газет упоминала в статье о \"возрождении искусства престидигитатора\", указывая, что многочисленные магические акты вновь возглавляют счет в наших мюзик-холлах. Руперт Энджер был упомянут по имени, среди немногих других.\n\nПозже один из журналов опубликовал подробную статью об Энджере. Она описывала его нынешний поступок как триумфальный уход в искусство открытой магии. Его новая иллюзия, названная в мгновение ока, была особо упомянута. В статье говорилось, что она устанавливает новые стандарты технического блеска, и вряд ли какой-либо другой иллюзионист сможет воспроизвести ее эффект. В той же статье упоминалось, что в мгновение ока произошло значительное развитие от \"предыдущих усилий\" в области иллюзий переноса, и была оскорбительная ссылка не только на нового перенесенного человека, но и на меня самого.\n\nЯ старался, честно старался не обращать внимания на подобные замечания, но эти упоминания в прессе были лишь первыми из многих. Несомненно, Руперт Энджер был на вершине нашей профессии.\n\nЯ решил, что должен сам увидеть новую иллюзию Энджера, и когда в конце октября услышал, что он начинает двухнедельную резиденцию в Империи Хакни, спокойно купил себе билет в партер. С моего места открывался хороший вид на сцену, но я находился не так близко, чтобы Энджер мог меня там заметить.\n\nВ основной части своего выступления он грамотно исполнял иллюзии из стандартного магического репертуара. Его стиль был хорош, ассистентка красива, а мастерство шоумена выше среднего. Во время этой части его действия, однако, я впервые заметил болезнь, которая поражала его лицо, и увидел другие признаки, которые указывали на плохое состояние. Он двигался скованно и несколько раз не использовал левую руку, как будто она была слабее другой.\n\nНаконец Энджер подошел к завершающей иллюзии. Он начал с серьезной речи, которую я быстро записал в блокнот. Вот что он сказал:\n\nДамы и господа! По мере того как Новый век движется быстрыми темпами, мы видим вокруг себя со всех сторон чудеса науки. Эти чудеса множатся почти каждый день. Однако никакое чудо, которое может произвести наука,не может сравниться с величайшими чудесами человеческого разума и человеческого тела.\n\nСегодня вечером, леди и джентльмены, я попытаюсь совершить магический акт, который объединит чудеса науки и чудеса человеческого разума. Ни один другой сценический исполнитель в мире не сможет воспроизвести то, что вы сейчас увидите сами!\n\nС этими словами он театрально поднял здоровую руку,и занавески раздвинулись. Там, в луче прожектора, стоял аппарат, который я хотел увидеть.\n\nОн оказался значительно больше, чем я ожидал. Маги обычно предпочитают работать с компактно построенными аппаратами. Оборудование Энджера практически заполнило всю сцену.\n\nВ центре сцены располагалась композиция из трех длинных металлических ножек, Соединенных на вершине триподально и поддерживающих блестящий металлический шар около полутора футов в диаметре. Под вершиной треножника было достаточно места, чтобы человек мог встать. Непосредственно над вершиной и под шаром находился цилиндрический механизм из дерева и металла, прочно прикрепленный к шарниру. Этот цилиндр был сделан из деревянных планок с отчетливыми промежутками между ними и сотни раз обмотан тонкими нитями проводов. С того места, где я сидел, я прикинул, что цилиндр имеет по меньшей мере четыре фута в высоту и, возможно, столько же в диаметре. Он медленно вращался, ловя и отражая огни сцены в наших глазах.\n\nВокруг механизма, на радиальном расстоянии около десяти футов, находился второй круг из восьми металлических планок, опять же сильно обмотанных проволокой. Они стояли на поверхности сцены концентрически к треноге. Планки были широко и равномерно расставлены, с большим зазором между ними. Зрители могли ясно видеть основную часть аппарата.\n\nЯ был совершенно не готов к этому, так как ожидал увидеть какой-то магический шкаф такого же размера, как и те, которыми я пользовался. Аппарат Энджера был так огромен, что на сцене не нашлось места для второго тайника.\n\nМой магический мозг начал лихорадочно работать, пытаясь предугадать иллюзию, чем она может отличаться от моей и в чем может заключаться секрет. Первое впечатление-удивление от его огромных размеров. Второе впечатление-замечательное обыденное качество аппарата. Не было никакой пользы от ярких цветов или отвлекающих огней. Третье впечатление-никакого намека на то, что должно было произойти.\n\nЭнджер начал исполнять свой трюк.\n\nКаждая часть аппарата была видна непосредственно, и, пока Энджер занимался приготовлениями, он ходил по сцене, всегда видимый. Я наблюдал за его ногами, часто частью анатомии иллюзиониста, чтобы внимательно наблюдать, когда он двигается вокруг и особенно позади своего аппарата (необъяснимое движение может указывать на присутствие зеркала или какого-то другого устройства), но походка Энджера была расслабленной и нормальной. Люков, которыми он мог бы воспользоваться, не было. Сцена была покрыта одним большим резиновым листом.\n\nТем временем Энджер повернулся лицом к аудитории.\n\n- Добрые господа, мадам, я прошу одного из вас, добровольца. Вам не нужно бояться того, что может случиться. Я требую от вас только простого акта проверки\".\n\nПосле обычного нервного колебания вперед вышел человек и поднялся на сцену по боковому пандусу. В этот момент на сцену вышел один из помощников Энджера, неся поднос с несколькими предметами; каждый из них предлагал средство маркировки или идентификации. Там были два или три колодца, наполненные разноцветными чернилами; там была миска с мукой; там было несколько мелков; там были палочки угля. Энджер предложил добровольцу выбрать одну из них, и когда тот выбрал миску с мукой, Энджер повернулся к нему спиной и предложил опрокинуть ее на спину. Этот человек так и сделал.\n\nЭнджер снова повернулся лицом к аудитории и попросил добровольца выбрать одну из чернил. Мужчина выбрал красное. Энджер протянул руки, чтобы на них полились красные чернила.\n\nТеперь уже отчетливо заметив это, Энджер попросил мужчину вернуться на свое место.\n\nРаздался какой-то неземной треск, и, к моему изумлению, из сверкающего шара внезапно вырвался сине-белый электрический разряд. Арка двигалась с ужасающей внезапностью, проносясь внутри арены, огороженной внешними планками, в которую теперь вошел сам Энджер.\n\nЭлектрический разряд внезапно удвоился, затем утроился, и дополнительные болты, извиваясь, как будто обыскивали замкнутое пространство. Один из них неизбежно находил Энджера и мгновенно обвивался вокруг него. Он приветствовал удар электричества, поднимая здоровую руку, поворачиваясь, позволяя змеящемуся, шипящему огню окружить его.\n\nКогда вокруг него пронеслось еще больше струящихся электрических дуг, Энджер двинулся к треноге в самом сердце ада, прямо под источником. Здесь он казался в безопасности. По-видимому, не в силах или не желая вернуться назад, сверкающие дуги света отскочили от него.\n\nТаким образом, эти восемь ослепительных лент образовали нечто вроде покрытия над ареной, на которой в одиночестве стоял Энджер. Прожектор внезапно погас, и все остальные огни сцены были приглушены. Его освещал только свет, падавший на него от разряда. Он стоял неподвижно, его здоровая рука была поднята, голова находилась всего на дюйм или около того ниже металлического цилиндра, откуда шло все электричество.\n\nОн опустил руки и в течение двух или трех секунд стоял молча, подчиняясь ужасному зрелищу, которое он устроил.\n\nПотом он исчез.\n\nТолько что здесь был Энджер, а в следующее мгновение его уже не было. Его аппарат издал визжащий, рвущийся звук и, казалось, задрожал, но с его уходом яркие остатки энергии мгновенно погасли. Сцена погрузилась в темноту.\n\nЯ стоял; сам того не сознавая, я стоял уже некоторое время. Я и остальные зрители стояли в изумлении. Человек исчез у нас на глазах, не оставив и следа.\n\nЯ услышала шум в проходе позади себя и обернулась, чтобы посмотреть, что происходит. Было слишком много голов и тел, я не мог ясно видеть, какое-то движение в темном зале! К счастью, в доме зажегся свет, и один из управляемых прожекторов повернулся со своего места высоко над коробками, и его свет осветил то, что происходило.\n\nЭнджер был там!\n\nПо проходу к нему спешили сотрудники театра, некоторые зрители пытались пробраться к нему, но он стоял на ногах и отталкивал их.\n\nОн, шатаясь, шел по проходу, направляясь обратно к сцене.\n\nЯ попытался оправиться от неожиданности и быстро прикинул. Между его исчезновением со сцены и появлением в проходе прошло не более двух секунд. Я посмотрела на сцену, пытаясь определить расстояние.\n\nВозможно ли, что он пробежал сотню футов за одну секунду, в то время как темнота сцены скрывала его движение?\n\nЭто был тогда и есть сейчас риторический вопрос. Ясно, что он не мог этого сделать, не прибегая к магическим приемам.\n\nНо какие именно?\n\nЛицо Энджера было измучено, все его тело двигалось так, словно его терзала боль. Он ковылял, как пьяница, или инвалид, или человек, окончательно измученный жизнью. Я увидел, что его левая рука висит безвольно на его стороне. На спине его куртки все еще виднелся всплеск муки.\n\nМы все аплодировали, многие одобрительно кричали и свистели, и когда он приблизился к сцене, второй прожектор выхватил его и проследил за ним по рампе на сцену. Он устало прошел на середину сцены, где, казалось, наконец пришел в себя. Еще раз в ярком свете прожекторов он принял овацию, кланяясь зрителям, приветствуя их, посылая воздушные поцелуи, улыбаясь и торжествуя. Я стоял вместе с остальными, удивляясь тому, что увидел.\n\nЯ не знал, как это делается! Я видел это своими собственными глазами, и я наблюдал, зная, как наблюдать за работой фокусника, и я смотрел во все места, из которых фокусник традиционно вводит в заблуждение свою аудиторию. Я покинул империю Хакни в кипящей ярости. Я был зол, что моя лучшая иллюзия была скопирована; я был еще более зол, что она была улучшена. Но хуже всего было то, что я никак не мог понять, как это делается.\n\nОн был одним человеком. Он был на одном месте. Он появился в другом. У него не могло быть двойника, равно как и невозможно, чтобы он мог так быстро перемещаться из одной позиции в другую.\n\nЯ вернулся в свою квартиру в Хорнси, где в то время жил, и провел бессонную ночь, беспокойно ворочаясь рядом с Олив.\n\nНа следующий день я принялся напряженно и практично обдумывать его версию моего трюка, чтобы посмотреть, что из этого получится.\n\nПризнаюсь еще раз: я не знаю, как он это сделал. Я не мог разгадать тайну, когда увидел представление, а потом, независимо от того, какие принципы магии я применял, я не мог придумать решение.\n\nУ меня было только две незначительные компенсации.\n\nВо-первых, каким бы блестящим ни был его эффект, моя собственная тайна от Энджера осталась нетронутой. Он не осуществил иллюзию по-моему.\n\nВторое - это скорость. Независимо от того, в чем его секрет, эффект от выступления Энджера все еще не был таким быстрым, как мой. Мое тело создано для того, чтобы мгновенно переноситься из одного шкафа в другой. Никакой задержки нет. Эффект Энджера был заметно медленнее. В тот вечер, когда я стал свидетелем иллюзии, я оценил, что прошла одна или, самое большее, две секунды, что означало для меня, что он был на одну или, самое большее, две секунды медленнее меня.\n\nЧерез две недели после этого случая, по договоренности с управляющим, я отправился в \"Империю Хакни\" под предлогом того, что хочу снять мерки перед одним из моих собственных спектаклей. Моя просьба была воспринята как нормальная, и помощник управляющего приветствовал меня и помог мне с моими исследованиями.\n\nЯ нашел место, где сидел, и установил, что оно находится чуть более чем в пятидесяти футах от сцены. Я стоял рядом с сиденьем, на котором сидел, и пытался определить положение Энджи, вспоминая угол, под которым я повернул голову, чтобы увидеть его. В конце концов, лучшее, что я мог сделать, - это поместить его где-нибудь в длинном проходе.\n\nКакое-то время я стоял в центре сцены, примерно на том месте, где была вершина треноги, и смотрел вдоль центрального прохода, размышляя, как бы мне самому добраться из одной позиции в другую в переполненном зале, в темноте, менее чем за пять секунд. Я не знал.\n\nЯ решил посетить следующий сезон выступлений Энджера, посещая его шоу каждый вечер, если это необходимо, пока не разгадаю тайну. Со мной будет Томми Элборн. Я буду цепляться за свою гордость так долго, как смогу, и если мне удастся вырвать у него его тайну, не вызывая у него подозрений, то это будет идеальным результатом. Но если к концу сезона мы не придем к действенной теории, мы оставим все соперничество и зависть прошлого, и я буду обращаться к нему напрямую, умоляя его, если это необходимо, понять объяснение. Таково было сводящее с ума действие его тайны.\n\nОднако ничего этого не произошло. После затянувшегося Рождества брейк Энджер в конце января отправился в турне по США.\n\nЧерез неделю после его возвращения в апреле (объявлено в \"Таймс\") Я зашел к нему домой, решив помириться с ним, но его там не было. Дом, большое, но скромное здание, был закрыт. Я разговаривал с соседями, но мне неоднократно говорили, что они ничего не знают о людях, которые там живут. Энджер, очевидно, держал свою жизнь в такой же безопасности от внешнего мира, как и я.\n\nЯ связался с хескетом Анвином, его агентом по бронированию, но получил отказ. Я оставил сообщение Анвину, умоляя Энджера срочно связаться со мной. Хотя агент обещал, что сообщение дойдет до Энджера лично, ответа так и не последовало.\n\nЯ написал Анжеру прямо, лично, предлагая положить конец всякому соперничеству, всякой горечи, предлагая любые извинения или извинения, которые он хотел бы назвать в деле примирения между нами.\n\nОн не ответил, И наконец я почувствовал, что попал в точку, выходящую за пределы разумного.\n\nБоюсь, моя реакция на его молчание была бесчувственной.\n\nГЛАВА ТРИНАДЦАТАЯ.\n\nНа третьей неделе мая я сел на поезд, идущий из Лондона в приморский город и рыбацкий порт Лоустофт в Суффолке. Здесь Энджер был забронирован на неделю выступлений. Я шел с единственной целью-проникнуть за кулисы и открыть для себя тайну.\n\nАнжер играл в \"павильоне\", солидном и хорошо оборудованном театре на берегу моря, в котором я сам когда - то выступал.\n\nЯ пошел в кассу и купил себе место в партере.\n\nМое место было в первом ряду партера. Энджер бросил на меня быстрый взгляд вскоре после того, как вышел на сцену, но я умело замаскировался и был уверен, что он меня не узнал.\n\nКогда Энджер начал играть в карты и вызвал добровольцев, я встал с показной нерешительностью, и меня, конечно же, пригласили на сцену. Как только я приблизился к Энджеру, я понял, как он нервничает, и он едва взглянул на меня, пока мы проходили забавный процесс выбора и сокрытия карт. Я играл все это честно, потому что разрушать его шоу было не то, что я хотел сделать.\n\nКогда процедура была завершена, его ассистентка быстро подошла ко мне сзади, вежливо, но твердо взяла меня за руку и повела к кулисам. Под шум аплодисментов я сказал ей: \"все в порядке, дорогая. Я могу найти свое место\".\n\nОна благодарно улыбнулась, похлопала меня по руке и повернулась к Энджеру. Когда аплодисменты стихли, он выдвинул вперед свой реквизиторский столик. Ни один из них не смотрел на меня. Большая часть зрителей смотрела на Энджера.\n\nЯ отступил назад и скользнул за кулисы. Тут же вышел рабочий сцены, чтобы преградить мне путь.\n\n- Извините, сэр, - громко сказал он. - Тебе нельзя заходить за кулисы.\n\nЭнджер стоял всего в нескольких футах от нас, приступая к следующему упражнению. Если я буду спорить с этим человеком, Энджер услышит нас и поймет, что что-то случилось. В порыве вдохновения я сняла шляпу и парик, которые были на мне.\n\n-Это часть представления, проклятый дурак! - Тихо спросил я. \"С дороги\"!\n\nРабочий сцены смутился и отступил назад. Я прошел мимо него и пошел по короткому коридору, пока не добрался до ступенек, ведущих вниз, на подмостки.\n\nМезонин - одно из главных технических помещений театра. Я обнаружил, что район опустел.\n\nВ глубине мезонина я нашел то, что искал. Я увидел два больших и крепких ящика с четкой надписью: рядовой-Великий Дантон. Рядом с ними стоял огромный преобразователь напряжения незнакомого мне типа. Мой собственный акт использовал такое устройство для питания электрического стенда, но оно было маленьким. Он испускал заметное тепло, когда я приблизился к нему, и низкий, мощный жужжащий звук исходил откуда-то из глубины.\n\nЯ склонился над конвертером, пытаясь понять, как он работает. Наверху я слышал шаги Энджера на сцене и звук его голоса. Я представил себе, как он расхаживает взад и вперед, произнося речь о чудесах науки.\n\nВнезапно преобразователь издал громкий стук, и, к моей тревоге, тонкий, но ядовитый синий дым начал с некоторой интенсивностью выходить из решетки в его верхней панели. Жужжание усилилось. Сначала я отскочил назад, но растущее чувство тревоги заставило меня снова двинуться вперед.\n\nЯ слышал шаги Энджера, продолжающиеся в нескольких футах над моей головой, явно не понимая, что здесь происходит.\n\nСнова внутри устройства раздался стук, на этот раз сопровождаемый самым Зловещим визгом. Дым валил быстрее, чем раньше, и когда я обошел объект с другой стороны, то обнаружил, что несколько толстых металлических спиралей раскалились докрасна.\n\nВокруг меня был беспорядок мезонина. Там были тонны сухих досок, мили веревок, кучи выброшенной бумаги, огромные декорации, написанные маслом. Все это место представляло собой трутницу, а в центре ее находилось нечто, готовое взорваться пламенем. Я стоял в ужасной нерешительности - мог ли Энджер или его помощники знать, что здесь происходит?\n\nПреобразователь издавал все больше звуков, дым проникал в мои легкие, и я начал задыхаться. В отчаянии я огляделся в поисках огнетушителя.\n\nЗатем я увидел, что преобразователь питается от толстого кабеля, идущего от большой электрической распределительной коробки, прикрепленной к задней стенке. Я бросился к нему. В него была встроена аварийная ручка включения/выключения, и, не раздумывая, я потянул ее вниз.\n\nАдская деятельность преобразователя мгновенно прекратилась. Голубой дым быстро рассеивался.\n\nНад головой раздался тяжелый удар, за которым последовала тишина.\n\nПрошла секунда или две, пока я извиняющимся взглядом смотрел на сцену этажом выше.\n\nЯ услышал топот ног и сердитый крик Энджера. Я тоже слышал публику, более неясный шум, ни аплодисментов, ни аплодисментов. Топот торопливых ног и громкие голоса наверху становились все громче. Что бы я ни сделал, это вызвало хаос.\n\nЯ пришел в этот театр, чтобы разгадать тайну, а не прерывать представление, но первое мне не удалось, а второе случайно удалось.\n\nЯ понял, что меня обнаружат, если я останусь на месте, поэтому отошел от быстро остывающего конвертера и вернулся тем же путем, каким пришел. Мои легкие начали болеть от дыма, который я вдохнул,и голова кружилась. Наверху, на сцене и в общем закулисье, я слышал, как много людей быстро и шумно двигалось вокруг. Где-то в здании, не слишком далеко, я услышал чей-то крик. В суматохе я смогу ускользнуть.\n\nВзбежав по ступенькам, я увидел удивительное зрелище!\n\nСам Энджер стоял на верхней ступеньке лестницы, ожидая меня, с поднятыми в гневе руками. Но мне показалось, что он принял облик призрака! За ним я увидел огни. Тут же у меня мелькнуло несколько мыслей - должно быть, это специальная одежда, которую он носит, чтобы помочь ему сделать этот трюк! Какая-то ткань, которая становится прозрачной! Делает его невидимым! Это его секрет?\n\nНо в тот же миг я налетел на него, и мы оба упали на пол. Он попытался схватить меня, но то, что он размазал по себе, помешало ему крепко схватить меня. Я смогла высвободиться и отодвинуться от него.\n\n\"Борден\"! Его голос был хриплым от гнева, не более чем ужасный шепот. \"Стой\"!\n\n\"Это был несчастный случай\"! - Крикнул я. \"Держись от меня подальше\"!\n\nЯ убежала от него, оставив его лежать на твердом полу. Я пробежал по короткому коридору, завернул за угол, сбежал по короткой лестнице, прошел еще по одному пустому коридору и наткнулся на будку привратника. Он удивленно посмотрел на меня, когда я промчался мимо, но у него не было никакой надежды остановить меня.\n\nЧерез несколько мгновений я уже стоял у служебного входа и спешил по тускло освещенной аллее к набережной.\n\nЗдесь я на мгновение остановился, глядя на море, наклонившись вперед и положив руки на колени. Я несколько раз мучительно закашлялся, пытаясь очистить легкие от остатков дыма. Был прекрасный сухой вечер в начале лета. Солнце только что село, и на набережной зажглись разноцветные огни. Был прилив, и волны мягко разбивались о морскую стену.\n\nЗрители выходили из театра \"павильон\" и расходились по городу. У многих людей были озадаченные лица, вероятно, из-за того, как внезапно закончилось шоу. Я прошелся с толпой по набережной, потом направился к вокзалу.\n\nМного позже, далеко за полночь, я вернулся в свой лондонский дом. Мои дети спали в своих комнатах, Саре было тепло рядом со мной, а я лежал в темноте, гадая, чего добилась ночь.\n\nА через семь недель Руперт Энджер умер.\n\nСказать, что я был поглощен чувством вины, было бы преуменьшением, тем более что обе газеты, в которых сообщалось о его кончине, упоминали о \"травмах\", которые он получил во время исполнения своей иллюзии. Они не сказали, что несчастный случай произошел в тот день, когда я был в Лоустофте, но я знал, что это тот самый.\n\nЯ уже установил, что Энджер отменил остаток своего сезона в павильоне, и, насколько мне было известно, после этого он больше нигде не выступал на публике. Я понятия не имел почему.\n\nТеперь стало ясно, что в ту ночь он был смертельно ранен. Что было необъяснимо для меня, так это то, что я столкнулся с Энджером менее чем через минуту после моего случайного вмешательства. Тогда он не казался смертельно раненным или даже раненым в незначительной степени. Единственной необычной вещью в нем было жирное вещество, которым он намазал себя или свой костюм, вероятно, чтобы создать иллюзию или помочь каким-то образом заставить себя исчезнуть. Это была настоящая загадка, потому что после того, как я оправился от последствий вдыхания дыма, мои воспоминания о тех нескольких секундах были точными. На мгновение я \"увидел его насквозь\", как будто части его были прозрачны.\n\nЕще одним незначительным аспектом тайны было то, что во время нашей ссоры на меня не попало ни капли вещества. Его руки определенно сжали мои запястья, и я отчетливо ощутила скользкое ощущение, но никаких следов не осталось.\n\nОднако я чувствовал себя виноватым и, столкнувшись с ужасом происшедшего, чувствовал, что не успокоюсь, пока не смогу хоть как-то загладить свою вину.\n\nК сожалению, газетные некрологи были опубликованы только через несколько дней после смерти Энджера, когда уже состоялись похороны. Это событие было бы идеальным местом для меня, чтобы начать процесс позднего примирения с его семьей и окружающими. Простая нота соболезнования помогла бы мне, но этому не суждено было случиться.\n\nПосле долгих раздумий я решил обратиться непосредственно к его вдове и написал ей искреннее и сочувственное письмо.\n\nВ нем я объяснил, кто я такой и как я, будучи гораздо моложе, к моему Вечному сожалению, поссорился с ее мужем. Я сказал, что известие о его преждевременной смерти потрясло и опечалило меня и что я знаю, что все магическое сообщество будет чувствовать потерю. Я отдал должное его мастерству как исполнителя и как изобретателя чудесных иллюзий.\n\nЗатем я перешел к тому, что было для меня целью письма. Я сказал, что, когда маг умирает, в мире магии принято, чтобы его коллеги предлагали купить любые устройства, которые могут больше не пригодиться семье. Я добавил, что, учитывая мои долгие и беспокойные отношения с Рупертом при его жизни, я считаю своим долгом и удовольствием сделать такое предложение теперь, когда он умер, и что в моем распоряжении имеются значительные средства.\n\nЧерез две недели после того, как я написал вдове Энджера, я получил ответ в виде письма от адвокатской конторы. Он сказал:\n\nМой Дорогой Сэр,\n\nВ соответствии с вашим недавним запросом, адресованным нашему клиенту, Лэм поручил сообщить вам, что все необходимые меры по распоряжению имуществом покойного Руперта Дэвида Энджера приняты и что вам нет необходимости предпринимать дальнейшие расспросы относительно их назначения или пользования\".\n\nВ этом мы остаемся, сэр, вашими покорными слугами,\n\nКендал, Кендал и Оуэн\n\n(Адвокаты и уполномоченные по присяге).\n\nГЛАВА ЧЕТЫРНАДЦАТАЯ.\n\nСегодня 1 сентября 1903 года, и я говорю, что моя собственная карьера закончилась со смертью Анже. Хотя я был достаточно богат, я был женатым человеком с детьми и имел дорогой и сложный образ жизни, чтобы поддерживать. Я не мог уйти от своих обязанностей, и поэтому я был вынужден принимать заказы, пока они были предложены мне. Таким образом, я не совсем отошел от дел, но честолюбие, которое двигало мной в ранние годы, желание удивлять, чистое удовольствие мечтать о невозможном-все это покинуло меня. Я все еще обладал техническими способностями к магии, мои руки оставались ловкими, и в отсутствие Энджера я снова был единственным исполнителем нового транспортированного человека, но этого было недостаточно.\n\nВеликое одиночество снизошло на меня. Договор не позволяет мне описать его полностью, за исключением того, что я был единственным другом, которого я жаждал для себя. И все же я, конечно, был единственным другом, которого я не мог встретить.\n\nЯ касаюсь этого так деликатно, как только могу.\n\nМоя жизнь полна тайн и противоречий, которые я никогда не смогу объяснить.\n\nЗа кого вышла замуж Сара? Это был я, или это был я? У меня двое детей, которых я обожаю. Но разве они мои, чтобы обожать, действительно только мои?.. или они действительно мои? Как я узнаю об этом, если не по инстинктивному влечению? В кого из меня влюбилась Олив и с кем переехала в квартиру в Хорнси? Не я первый занялся с ней любовью, не я пригласил ее в квартиру, но я воспользовался ее присутствием, зная, что делаю то же самое.\n\nКакой из меня был он, кто пытался разоблачить Анжер? Кто из меня первым изобрел нового транспортируемого человека, и кто из меня первым был транспортирован?\n\nДаже самому себе я кажусь бессвязным, но каждое слово здесь связно и точно. Это основная дилемма моего существования.\n\nВчера я играл в театре в Балхэме, на юго-западе Лондона. Я устроил утренник, а потом два часа ждал вечернего представления. Как часто бывало в такие минуты, я пошел в свою гардеробную, закрыл и запер дверь, приглушил свет и лег спать на диване.\n\nЯ проснулся -\n\nПроснулся ли я вообще? Было ли это видение? Сон?\n\nПроснувшись, я увидел в своей гардеробной призрачную фигуру Руперта Энджера, держащего в обеих руках нож с длинным лезвием. Прежде чем я успела пошевелиться или крикнуть, он прыгнул на меня, приземлился на край дивана и быстро заполз на меня сверху, так что оказался верхом на моей груди и животе. Он поднял нож и держал его острием над моим сердцем.\n\n- Приготовься умереть, Борден! - сказал он своим ужасным шепотом.\n\nВ этом адском видении мне казалось, что он почти ничего не весит, что я легко могу оттолкнуть его от себя, но страх ослаблял меня. Я поднял руки и схватил его за предплечья, пытаясь помешать ему смертельно вонзить в меня нож, но, к своему изумлению, обнаружил, что он все еще покрыт жирной субстанцией, которая мешала мне крепко схватить его. Чем сильнее я старалась, тем быстрее мои пальцы скользили по его отвратительной плоти. Я вдыхал его зловоние, запах могилы.\n\nЯ ахнула от ужаса, потому что почувствовала, как острое лезвие больно уперлось мне в грудь.\n\n- Сейчас! Скажи мне, Борден! Кто из них ты? Который\"?\n\nЯ едва мог дышать, таков был мой страх, таков был ужас, что в любую секунду лезвие могло пронзить мое сердце.\n\n\"Скажи мне, и я пощажу тебя\"! Давление ножа усилилось.\n\n-Не знаю, Энджер! Я больше не знаю себя\"!\n\nИ каким-то образом это закончилось, почти так же быстро, как и началось. Его лицо было в нескольких дюймах от моего, и я увидела, как он гримасничает от ярости. Его гнилое дыхание обдало меня. Нож начал пронзать мою кожу! Я замахнулся на него раз,другой, отбивая его от себя. Смертельное давление на мое сердце смягчилось. Нож поднялся. Он все еще был на мне, так что я ударил его снова,а затем толкнул боком, чтобы сбросить его. К моему огромному облегчению, он выпустил нож и упал на пол. Смертоносный клинок ударился о стену и упал на пол, а призрачная фигура покатилась по полу.\n\nОн быстро вскочил на ноги, выглядя слабым, и наблюдал за мной на случай, если я снова нападу. Я сел на диване. Он был духом абсолютного ужаса, призраком в смерти моего злейшего врага в жизни.\n\nЯ видел, как сквозь его полупрозрачное тело пробивается свет лампы.\n\n- Оставь меня в покое, - прохрипел я. -Ты мертв! Тебе нечего делать со мной!\"\n\n-Как и я с тобой, Борден. Убить тебя-это не месть. Это никогда не должно было случиться. Никогда\"!\n\nПризрак Руперта Энджера отвернулся от меня, подошел к запертой двери и прошел через нее. От него не осталось ничего, кроме стойкого следа его отвратительного зловония.\n\nЯ неподвижно сидел на диване, парализованный страхом. Через несколько минут в комнату вошел мой комод и попытался войти, но его настойчивый стук наконец поднял меня с дивана.\n\nЯ нашел нож Энджера на полу в раздевалке, и теперь он у меня. Это реально. Его нес призрак.\n\nНичего не имеет смысла. Мне больно дышать, двигаться; я все еще чувствую, как острие ножа упирается мне в сердце. Я нахожусь в квартире Хорнси и не знаю, что делать и кто я на самом деле.\n\nКаждое слово, которое я здесь написал, - правда, и каждое описывает реальность моей жизни. Мои руки пусты, и я смотрю на тебя честным взглядом. Вот как я жил, и все же это ничего не показывает.\n\nЯ пойду один до конца.\n\nЧАСТЬ ТРЕТЬЯ.\n\nКЕЙТ ЭНДЖЕР.\n\nГЛАВА ПЕРВАЯ.\n\nМне тогда было всего пять лет, но я не сомневаюсь, что все это произошло на самом деле.\n\nЭто было жестоко, необъяснимо и почти наверняка незаконно. Это разрушило жизнь большинства вовлеченных людей. Это разрушило мою собственную жизнь.\n\nТеперь я могу рассказать историю так, как я ее видел, но рассказать ее как взрослый.\n\nМой отец-лорд Колдердейл, шестнадцатый носитель этого имени. Наша фамилия Энджер. Мой отец, Виктор Эдмунд, сын Эдварда, единственного сына Руперта Энджера. Таким образом, Руперт Энджер, Великий Дантон, был моим прадедом и четырнадцатым графом Колдердейлом.\n\nМаму звали Дженнифер, хотя дома отец всегда называл ее Дженни. Они познакомились, когда мой отец работал в Министерстве иностранных дел, в 1946 году, во время поездки на поезде из Берлина в Лондон. Она была медсестрой, которая работала с оккупационными державами в столице Германии и возвращалась в Англию в конце своего срока службы.\n\nОни поженились в 1947 году, и примерно в то же время мой отец был освобожден от должности в Министерстве иностранных дел. Они поселились здесь, в Колдлоу, где в конце концов родились мы с сестрой. Я мало что знаю о тех годах, которые прошли до того, как мы появились на свет, и о том, почему мои родители покинули этот мир задолго до рождения детей. Их брак никогда не был полностью гладким. Я знаю, что моя мать ненадолго покинула моего отца в конце 1950-х годов, потому что однажды, много лет спустя, я подслушал разговор между ней и ее сестрой, моей тетей Каролиной. Моя сестра Розали родилась в 1962 году, а я-в 1965-м. Отцу тогда было под пятьдесят, а матери-под сорок.\n\nКак и большинство людей, я мало что помню о своих первых годах жизни. Когда мне было восемь лет, меня отправили в школу-интернат для девочек, но пока я была маленькой, большую часть своей жизни я провела дома с матерью. Когда мне было четыре года, она отдала меня в детский сад в деревне Колдлоу, а потом в начальную школу в Болдоне, соседней деревне по дороге к часовне.\n\nМеня возили в школу и обратно в отцовском \"черном Штандарте\", за рулем которого сидел мистер Стимпсон, представлявший вместе с женой весь наш домашний персонал.\n\nОднажды к главным воротам подъехала машина, и Стимпсон спустился вниз, чтобы впустить ее. Машина, подъехавшая к дому, была \"мини\". Краска потеряла свой блеск, передний бампер погнулся от столкновения, а вокруг окон виднелась ржавчина. Это была совсем не та машина, которую мы обычно видели. Большинство других друзей моих родителей были, по-видимому, состоятельными или важными людьми.\n\nМужчина, сидевший за рулем, сунул руку на заднее сиденье \"мини\" и вытащил оттуда маленького мальчика, только что проснувшегося. Он прижал мальчика к своему плечу. Стимпсон вежливо проводил их до дома. Мы с Розали смотрели, как Стимпсон вернулся к \"мини\", чтобы выгрузить багаж, который они привезли с собой, но нам велели спуститься из детской и встретить гостей. Все собрались в нашей главной гостиной. Оба моих родителя были одеты так, словно это было важное событие, но гости выглядели более непринужденно.\n\nМы были официально представлены друг другу; Моя семья серьезно относилась к светским манерам, и мы с Розали были опытны в них. Мужчину звали Мистер Клайв Борден, а мальчика, его сына, звали Николас или Ники. Никки было около двух лет, то есть на три года младше меня и на пять лет младше моей сестры.\n\nИз моих собственных исследований я позже узнал немного больше об этой семье. Я знаю, например, что жена Клайва Бордена умерла вскоре после рождения ребенка. Ее девичья фамилия была Диана Рут Эллингтон, и она была родом из Хэтфилда в Хартфордшире. Николас был ее единственным сыном. Сам Клайв Борден был сыном Грэма, сына Альфреда Бордена, волшебника. Таким образом, Клайв Борден был внуком злейшего врага Руперта Энджера, а Ники-его правнуком, моим современником.\n\nОчевидно, в то время мы с Розали ничего об этом не знали, и через несколько минут мама предложила отвести ники в детскую и показать ему наши игрушки. Мы повиновались, и миссис Стимпсон посмотрела нам вслед.\n\nЧто потом произошло между тремя взрослыми, я могу только догадываться, но это продолжалось весь день. Клайв Борден и его сын приехали вскоре после обеда, и мы, трое детей, играли вместе, не прерываясь, весь день, пока почти не стемнело. Миссис Стимпсон наблюдала за посещением туалета и приносила нам закуски и напитки.\n\nЯ понимаю, что эта встреча была одной из случайных попыток уладить ссору между нашими предками. Какое может иметь значение сейчас или тогда, что два мага сцены постоянно вцепляются друг другу в глотки? Ненависть или зависть между этими двумя стариками, конечно, не могли касаться далеких потомков, у которых были свои собственные жизни и дела. Ну, так может показаться во всем здравом смысле, но страсти крови иррациональны.\n\nВ случае с Клайвом Борденом иррациональность кажется частью его самого. Его жизнь трудно исследовать, но я знаю, что он родился в западном Лондоне. Он провел среднее детство и имел изрядный спортивный талант. После окончания школы он поступил в колледж, но бросил его после первого курса. В последующие десять лет он часто оставался бездомным и, вероятно, останавливался в домах многих друзей и родственников. Его несколько раз арестовывали за пьяное поведение, но каким-то образом удавалось избежать судимости. Он называл себя актером и зарабатывал на жизнь в киноиндустрии, выполняя дополнительную и вспомогательную работу, когда только мог ее найти. Единственный короткий период эмоциональной и физической стабильности в его жизни был, когда он встретил и женился на Диане Эллингтон. Они поселились вместе в Твикенхэме, Мидлсекс, но брак оказался трагически недолгим. После смерти Дианы Клайв Борден остался жить в квартире, которую они снимали, и сумел уговорить замужнюю сестру, жившую в том же районе, помочь воспитывать мальчика. Он продолжал сниматься в кино и, хотя снова скитался по свету, обеспечивал ребенка. Таково было его общее положение в то время, когда он приезжал навестить моих родителей.\n\n(После этого визита он покинул квартиру в Твикенхэме, по-видимому, вернулся в центр Лондона, а зимой 1971 года уехал за границу. Сначала он поехал в США, а затем отправился в Канаду или Австралию. По словам сестры, он сменил фамилию и намеренно порвал все связи со своим прошлым. Я сделал все, что мог, но не смог даже установить, жив ли он еще.)\n\nНо теперь я возвращаюсь к тому дню и вечеру, когда Клайв Борден посетил Колдлоу-Хаус, и пытаюсь восстановить то, что произошло, пока мы, дети, играли наверху.\n\nМой отец проявил гостеприимство, предложив выпить и открыв редкое вино, чтобы отпраздновать это событие. Именно так вел себя мой отец в социальной ситуации, исход которой он не мог ни предсказать, ни контролировать.\n\nМоя мать тем временем играла более тонкую роль. По-моему, она почти ничего не говорила, по крайней мере в течение первого часа или около того, но сосредоточилась на одной теме, которая волновала их всех. Она все пыталась направить разговор в нужное русло.\n\nМне труднее говорить о Клайве Бордене, потому что я его почти не знала, но он, вероятно, предложил встретиться. Я думаю, что был обмен письмами, который привел к приглашению. Теперь я знаю его финансовое положение в то время, может быть, он надеялся, что в результате примирения у него что-то получится. Или, может быть, он наконец-то нашел семейные мемуары, которые могли бы объяснить или оправдать поведение Альфреда Бордена. (Книга Бордена тогда, конечно, существовала, но мало кто за пределами мира магии знал о ней.) с другой стороны, он мог узнать о существовании личного дневника Руперта Энджера. Почти наверняка он сохранил его из-за своей одержимости датами и деталями, но он либо спрятал, либо уничтожил его перед смертью.\n\nЯ уверен, что за встречей стояла попытка уладить вражду, кто бы ее ни предложил. То, что я видел тогда и могу вспомнить сейчас, было достаточно сердечным, по крайней мере поначалу. В конце концов, это была встреча лицом к лицу, а это было больше, чем когда-либо удавалось поколению их собственных родителей.\n\nВ день визита Клайва Бордена нас, детей, в конце концов вывели из детской и повели в столовую, где мы ели вместе со взрослыми. Нам нравился Никки, и мы втроем были рады сидеть вместе по одну сторону стола. Я отчетливо помню обед, но только потому, что с нами был Никки. Мы с сестрой думали, что он притворяется, чтобы позабавить нас, но теперь я понимаю, что он просто не знал, как себя вести. Отец иногда говорил с ним резко, пытаясь поправить или успокоить, но мы с Розали подбадривали мальчика.\n\nБез нашего ведома наше шумное поведение, несомненно, способствовало напряженности между взрослыми. Повышенный голос Клайва Бордена превратился в скрежещущий звук, который мне начал не нравиться. Оба моих родителя плохо реагировали на него, и всякое притворство вежливости было отброшено. Они начали спорить, и мой отец обратился к нему тем голосом, который мы обычно слышали в ресторанах, где обслуживание было медленным. К концу трапезы отец был наполовину пьян, наполовину разъярен; мать была бледна и молчалива, а Клайв Борден (по-видимому, тоже сильно пьян) без конца рассказывал о своих несчастьях. Миссис Стимпсон провела нас троих в соседнюю комнату, нашу гостиную.\n\nНики почему-то заплакала. Он сказал, что хочет домой, и когда мы с Розали попытались его успокоить, он набросился на нас, пиная и колотя.\n\nЧто касается моего отца, то мы и раньше видели его в таком настроении.\n\n-Мне страшно, - сказала Я Розали.\n\n-Я тоже, - сказала она.\n\nМы прислушались у двойной двери, соединяющей две комнаты. Мы услышали громкие голоса, потом долгое молчание. Отец расхаживал по комнате, нетерпеливо постукивая ботинками по полированному паркету.\n\nГЛАВА ВТОРАЯ.\n\nБыла одна часть дома, куда нас, детей, никогда не пускали. Попасть туда можно было через выкрашенную в коричневый цвет дверь под задней лестницей. Эта дверь всегда была заперта, и до дня визита Клайва Бордена я ни разу не видела, чтобы кто-нибудь из семьи или слуг проходил через нее.\n\nРозали говорила мне, что за ней есть место с привидениями. Она рассказала мне о трагически потерянных душах в поисках покоя, о цепких руках и когтях, которые поджидали наши руки и ноги в темноте в нескольких дюймах за дверью. У Розали было преимущество в три года, и она знала, что меня напугает.\n\nВ детстве я постоянно боялась. Все это место старое, наполненное воспоминаниями о жизни других людей, покрытое шрамами от их смертей. Это не место для ребенка с богатым воображением.\n\nМрачные коридоры и лестницы, потайные альковы, мрачные старинные портреты-все это создавало ощущение гнетущей угрозы. Комнаты, в которых мы жили, были ярко освещены и обставлены современной мебелью, но рядом с ними были древние трагедии и тихие вечера. Я научилась быстро проходить через некоторые части дома, устремляя взгляд прямо перед собой, чтобы не отвлекаться на что-то из этого леденящего прошлого, что могло бы причинить мне вред. Коридор внизу, рядом с задней лестницей, где была обнаружена выкрашенная в коричневый цвет дверь, был одной из таких частей дома.\n\nВсе мое детство, до и после того дня, когда Клайв Борден пришел навестить меня, я проходил мимо двери в дальнем конце коридора. Я никогда не останавливался, чтобы прислушаться к движению за ним. Я всегда спешил мимо, стараясь не обращать на это внимания.\n\nНас троих, Розали, меня и мальчика Бордена Ники, заставили ждать в гостиной, рядом со столовой, где взрослые все еще вели свой непонятный конфликт. Обе эти комнаты выходили в коридор, где находилась коричневая дверь.\n\nСнова послышались голоса. Кто-то прошел мимо смежной двери. Я услышала голос матери, и она казалась расстроенной.\n\nЗатем Стимпсон быстро пересек гостиную и проскользнул через смежную дверь в столовую. Мы мельком увидели троих взрослых; они все еще сидели за столом, но стояли. Я мельком увидела лицо матери, и оно показалось мне искаженным горем и гневом. Дверь быстро закрылась, прежде чем мы успели войти в комнату вслед за Стимпсоном.\n\nМы слышали, как говорил мой отец. Этот тон всегда означал, что за этим последуют неприятности. Клайв Борден что-то сказал, и отец ответил сердито, достаточно громко, чтобы мы слышали каждое слово.\n\n- Так и будет, Мистер Борден! - сказал он, и голос его на мгновение сорвался на фальцет. \"Теперь ты будешь\"!\n\nМы услышали, как открылась дверь столовой в коридор. Борден снова что-то сказал, все еще неразборчиво.\n\nПотом Розали прошептала мне на ухо:\"Я думаю, папа откроет коричневую дверь\"!\n\nЯ в панике прижалась к Розали. Ники, зараженный нашим страхом, испустил вопль. Я тоже начал выть, чтобы не слышать, что делают взрослые.\n\nРозали зашипела на меня:\"тише!\"\n\n-Я не хочу, чтобы дверь открывали! - Воскликнул я.\n\nЗатем, высокий и внезапный, Клайв Борден ворвался в гостиную из коридора и обнаружил нас троих. Он шагнул вперед и обнял Ники.\n\nЯ слышал, как он что-то пробормотал мальчику, но это не был успокаивающий звук. Позади него, через коридор, под лестницей, я увидел открытый прямоугольник, где раньше была коричневая дверь. Сзади горел свет, и я увидел две ступеньки, ведущие вниз, затем пол-оборота и еще несколько ступенек внизу.\n\nЯ смотрела, как Ники выносят из комнаты. Отец держал его высоко, так что он мог обхватить руками шею отца, повернувшись лицом назад. Его отец протянул руку и положил ее на голову мальчика, когда тот нырнул в дверной проем и спустился по ступенькам.\n\nМы с Розали остались одни. Я держалась за свою старшую сестру, обеими руками обхватив ее ногу. Миссис Стимпсон нигде не было видно.\n\n\"Ты идешь с ними\"? - Спросила Розали.\n\n- Нет! Иди! Ты посмотри и скажи мне, что они делают\"!\n\n-Я пойду в детскую, - сказала она.\n\n\"Не оставляй меня\"! - Воскликнул я. -Я не хочу оставаться здесь одна. Не уходи\"!\n\n-Ты можешь пойти со мной.\n\n- Нет. Что они собираются сделать с Ники?\n\nНо Розали оттолкнула меня. Лицо ее побледнело, глаза были полузакрыты. Ее трясло.\n\n\"Ты можешь делать все, что хочешь\"! - сказала она и выбежала из комнаты. Она прошла по страшному коридору, миновала открытую дверь, повернула у подножия лестницы и помчалась наверх. Теперь, со взрослой точки зрения, я подозреваю, что она напугала себя больше, чем меня.\n\nЧувство спокойствия охватило меня, парализуя мое воображение. Это была всего лишь еще одна форма страха,но она позволила мне двигаться. Я знал, что не могу оставаться один там, где нахожусь, и знал, что у меня не хватит сил последовать за Розали по этой далекой лестнице. Оставалось только одно место. Я подошел к открытой коричневой двери и посмотрел вниз.\n\nНа потолке горели две лампочки, освещая путь вниз, но внизу, где была еще одна дверь, ведущая в сторону, на ступеньки лился гораздо более яркий свет. Лестница выглядела голой и обычной, на удивление чистой, без малейшего намека на опасность. Снизу доносились голоса.\n\nЯ тихо спустился по ступенькам, не желая, чтобы меня заметили, но, спустившись вниз и заглянув в главный подвал, понял, что прятаться незачем. Взрослые были заняты тем, что делали.\n\nЯ был достаточно взрослым, чтобы понимать многое из того, что происходило. Когда я впервые спустился по ступенькам, отец и Клайв Борден снова спорили, на этот раз большую часть разговора вел Борден. Моя мать стояла в стороне, как и слуга Стимпсон. Ники все еще был в объятиях отца.\n\nПодвал был просторным, прохладным и чистым. Я и понятия не имел,что в нашей части дома так много места.\n\nБольшая часть подвала была заполнена вещами, принесенными из главного дома для хранения. Вдоль одной из стен стояла стопка холстов в рамах, раскрашенные стороны которых были обращены к стене.\n\nЗатем мое внимание привлек аппарат, встроенный в центр подвала.\n\nМоей первой мыслью было, что это что-то вроде неглубокой клетки, потому что это был круг из восьми деревянных планок. Затем я понял, что он был построен в яме в полу. Чтобы войти в нее, нужно было спуститься вниз, так что она действительно была больше, чем казалась на первый взгляд. Мой отец, вышедший в центр круга, был виден только по пояс. Наверху тоже была устроена проводка, и что-то вращалось на центральной оси, вспыхивая в подвальных огнях. Мой отец усердно работал, очевидно, под моим взглядом было какое-то устройство управления, и он наклонился, качая что-то рукой.\n\nМама стояла в стороне, внимательно наблюдая за происходящим, а Стимпсон стоял рядом. Эти двое молчали.\n\nКлайв Борден стоял у одной из деревянных решеток, наблюдая за работой отца. Его сын Ники был у него на руках и тоже повернулся, чтобы посмотреть вниз. Борден что-то говорил, а отец, продолжая качать, отвечал громко, жестикулируя рукой. Я знала, что отец в опасном настроении, как мы с Розали, когда доводили его до такой степени, что он чувствовал, что должен что-то нам доказать, каким бы нелепым это ни было.\n\nЯ понял, что Борден провоцирует его на такую ярость, возможно, намеренно. Я шагнула вперед, но не к взрослым, а к Ники. Этот маленький мальчик был захвачен чем-то, чего он никак не мог понять, и моим инстинктом было броситься к нему, взять его за руку и, возможно, увести прочь от опасной взрослой игры.\n\nЯ прошел половину расстояния до группы, совершенно незамеченный кем-либо из них, когда мой отец крикнул: Отойдите все назад!\n\nМоя мать и Стимпсон, которые, вероятно, знали, что произойдет, немедленно отошли на несколько шагов. Клайв Борден не двигался и стоял всего в футе или двух от края ямы. На меня по-прежнему никто не смотрел.\n\nСерия громких ударов внезапно вырвалась из устройства, и с каждым из них появлялся длинный стержень белого электрического разряда. Шум был оглушительный. Отец поднял глаза на Бордена, и я увидел знакомое выражение торжества на его лице.\n\n\"Теперь ты знаешь\"! - крикнул он ему.\n\n- Выключи его, Виктор! - воскликнула мама.\n\n-Но мистер Борден настоял! Ну вот, мистер Борден! Удовлетворяет ли это вашу настойчивость?\"\n\nБорден все еще стоял на небольшом расстоянии от змеящегося электрического разряда. Он держал на руках своего маленького мальчика. Я видела выражение лица Ники и знала, что он так же напуган, как и я.\n\n\"Это ничего не доказывает\"! - Крикнул Борден.\n\nВ ответ отец закрыл большую металлическую ручку, прикрепленную к одной из колонн внутри машины. Зигзагообразные лучи энергии тут же удвоились в размерах. Шум стоял оглушительный.\n\n- Садись, Борден, - крикнул отец. \"Залезай и посмотри сам\"!\n\nК моему изумлению, отец выбрался из ямы и ступил на первый этаж погреба между двумя деревянными прутьями. В тот же миг на него обрушилось множество электрических лучей. На мгновение он был окружен ими, поглощенный огнем. Он казался освещенным изнутри. Затем он сделал еще один шаг и оказался вне игры.\n\n- А ты не боишься, Борден? - резко крикнул он.\n\nЯ был достаточно близко, чтобы увидеть, что волосы на голове моего отца встали дыбом.\n\n\"Будь ты проклят, будь ты проклят\"! - воскликнул Борден.\n\nОн повернулся к моему отцу и толкнул на него испуганного ребенка. Ники попытался вцепиться в отца,но Борден оттолкнул его. Мой отец принял мальчика, скрепя сердце, принимать его в неловкое держать. Ники кричал от ужаса и пытался освободиться.\n\n\"Прыгай сейчас же\"! - крикнул отец Бордену. \"Он уйдет в ближайшие несколько секунд\"!\n\nБорден сделал шаг вперед, пока не оказался на краю электрической зоны. Мой отец был рядом с ним, в то время как Ники протягивал к нему руки, крича и зовя своего папу. Размахивающие синие змеи разрядов бешено двигались в каких-то сантиметрах перед Борденом. Его волосы встали дыбом, и я видел, как он сжимает и разжимает кулаки. Один из стеблей нашел его, змеясь вниз по шее, вокруг плеч и спины.\n\nОн в ужасе отскочил назад, и мне стало его жалко.\n\n\"Я не могу этого сделать\"! задохнулся он. \"Выключи эту чертову штуку\"!\n\n-Ты ведь этого хотел, не так ли?\n\nМой отец был полон безумия. Он шагнул вперед, подальше от Клайва Бордена, в смертоносный поток электричества. Полдюжины стеблей мгновенно обвились вокруг него и мальчика. Все волосы на его голове встали дыбом, делая его еще более ужасным, чем когда-либо.\n\nОн бросил ники в яму.\n\nОтец отступил назад, подальше от смертоносного огня.\n\nКогда Ники упал, его руки и ноги дико царапали воздух, он снова закричал, один отчаянный вопль. Это был крик ужаса, одиночества и страха быть брошенным.\n\nПрежде чем он ударился о землю, устройство взорвалось светом. Пламя вырвалось из верхних проводов. Деревянные планки, казалось, раздулись от давления изнутри, и когда стебли света втянулись внутрь, они сделали это с металлическим скрежетом.\n\nВсе закончилось ужасно. Густой синий дым тяжело висел в воздухе. Устройство наконец замолчало и ничего не делало.\n\nНики неподвижно лежал на жестком полу под строением.\n\nГде-то вдалеке, казалось, я слышал его ужасный крик, все еще отдававшийся эхом.\n\nГЛАВА ТРЕТЬЯ.\n\nЯ пошел вперед. Вскоре я уже стоял на краю, рядом с матерью. Моя рука поднялась, как это часто бывало раньше, и сжалась в ее пальцах. Она тоже смотрела вниз с ужасом и недоверием.\n\nНики был мертв. Его лицо застыло в предсмертном крике,руки и ноги были вывернуты. Он лежал на спине. Его волосы встали дыбом вокруг окаменевшего лица.\n\nКлайв Борден испустил ужасный вопль страдания, гнева и отчаяния и спрыгнул в яму. Он бросился на землю, обхватил руками тело сына, нежно попытался вернуть его конечности в нормальное положение, обхватил голову мальчика рукой, прижался лицом к щеке мальчика, все время сотрясаясь от ужасных рыданий, идущих из глубины его души.\n\nА мама, словно впервые осознав, что я рядом, вдруг обхватила меня руками, прижала лицом к своей юбке и подняла. Она быстро прошла через подвал, унося меня прочь от места катастрофы.\n\nЯ стоял спиной к ней, и когда мы быстро вышли на лестницу, я в последний раз увидел отца. Он смотрел вниз, в яму, и на его лице было такое выражение сурового удовлетворения, что более двух десятилетий спустя я до сих пор вспоминаю его только с дрожью отвращения.\n\nМой отец знал, что произойдет, он позволил этому случиться, он заставил это случиться. Все в выражении его лица говорило: Я доказал свою точку зрения.\n\nЯ заметил также, что слуга Стимпсон скорчился на полу. Он склонил голову.\n\nЯ потерял или подавил все воспоминания о том, что произошло после этого. Я помню только, что был в школе в течение следующего года, а затем менял школу, заводил новых друзей, постепенно взрослел в детстве.\n\nИ я не помню, когда мой отец покинул нас. Я знаю дату, когда это произошло, потому что нашла ее в дневнике, который вела моя мать в последние годы своей жизни, но моя собственная память о том времени утеряна. Благодаря ее дневнику я также знаю большинство ее чувств по поводу разрыва и некоторые обстоятельства. Со своей стороны, я помню общее ощущение его присутствия, когда я был маленьким, его непредсказуемую фигуру. Я также помню жизнь потом без него, сильное чувство его отсутствия, мир, который нам с Розали нравился и который продолжался с тех пор.\n\nСначала я была рада, что он ушел. Только когда я стал старше, я начал скучать по нему, как и сейчас. Я думаю, что он все еще жив, потому что иначе мы бы услышали. Нашим поместьем трудно управлять, и мой отец все еще несет за это ответственность. В дерби есть семейный фонд, управляемый поверенными, и они, по-видимому, поддерживают с ним связь. Дом, земля и титул по-прежнему на его имя. Многие прямые расходы, такие как налоги, оплачиваются фондом, и деньги по-прежнему доступны нам с Розали.\n\nНаш последний прямой контакт с ним произошел около пяти лет назад, когда он написал письмо из Южной Африки. - Проездом, - сказал он, хотя не сказал, откуда и куда. Сейчас ему за семьдесят. Сколько бы времени ни прошло, я всегда помню его как человека с жестоким лицом, который бросил маленького мальчика в машину, которая, как он знал, наверняка убьет его.\n\nКлайв Борден покинул дом в тот же вечер. Я понятия не имею, что случилось с телом Ники, хотя всегда предполагала, что Борден забрал его с собой.\n\nПоскольку я был так молод, я принял власть моих родителей как окончательную, и когда они сказали мне, что полиция не будет заинтересована в смерти мальчика, я поверил им. В данном случае они, похоже, были правы.\n\nМного лет спустя, когда я стал достаточно взрослым, чтобы понять, насколько это было неправильно, я попытался спросить свою мать, что случилось. Это было после того, как мой отец ушел из дома, и примерно за два года до ее смерти.\n\nМне казалось, что пришло время прояснить тайны прошлого. Я также видел в этом признак моего собственного взросления. Я хотел, чтобы она была со мной откровенна и обращалась со мной как со взрослым. Я знал, что на прошлой неделе она получила письмо от моего отца, и это дало мне повод поднять эту тему.\n\n- Почему полиция никогда не приходила задавать вопросы? Я сказал.\n\nОна сказала: \"Мы никогда не говорим об этом, Кэтрин\".\n\n-Ты хочешь сказать, что никогда этого не делаешь? -Но почему папа ушел из дома?\n\n\"Спроси его об этом\".\n\n-Ты же знаешь, что я не могу, - сказал я. -Ты единственный, кто знает. В ту ночь он сделал что-то не так, но я не знаю почему и даже не знаю как. Полиция его ищет?\"\n\n- Полиция не вмешивается в нашу жизнь.\n\n- А почему нет? Я сказал. - Разве папа не убил того мальчика? Разве это не было убийством?\n\n-В то время со всем этим уже разобрались. Нечего скрывать, нечего чувствовать себя виноватым. Мы заплатили цену за то, что случилось той ночью. Конечно, больше всех пострадал Мистер Борден, но посмотрите, что он сделал со всеми нашими жизнями. Я не могу сказать вам ничего такого, что вы хотели бы знать. Вы сами видели, что произошло\".\n\n- Не могу поверить, что это конец, - сказал я.\n\n- Кэтрин, не задавай таких вопросов. Ты тоже там был. Ты так же виновен, как и все мы\".\n\n-Мне было всего пять лет! Я сказал. \"Как это может сделать меня виновным в чем-то\"?\n\n-Если у вас есть какие-то сомнения, вы могли бы установить это, обратившись в полицию самостоятельно.\n\nМужество покинуло меня перед лицом ее холодных манер. Мистер и миссис Стимпсон тогда еще работали у нас, и позже я задавал Стимпсону те же вопросы. Вежливо, чопорно, кратко он отрицал все, что ему было известно о происшедшем.\n\nГЛАВА ЧЕТВЕРТАЯ.\n\nМоя мать умерла, когда мне было восемнадцать. Мы с Розали думали, что известие об этом заставит нашего отца вернуться, но этого не случилось. Мы остались в доме, и постепенно до нас дошло, что это место принадлежит нам. Мы реагировали по-разному. Розали постепенно освободилась от этого места и в конце концов ушла. Я начал попадать в ловушку, и я все еще здесь. Большую часть того, что удерживало меня, было чувство вины, от которого я не мог избавиться, за то, что произошло там, в подвале. Все сосредоточилось на этих событиях, и в конце концов я понял, что должен что-то сделать, чтобы очистить себя от того, что произошло.\n\nНаконец я набрался храбрости и спустился в подвал, чтобы проверить, осталось ли там хоть что-нибудь из того, что я видел.\n\nЯ решил сделать это в летний день, когда приезжали друзья из Шеффилда и дом был полон звуков рок-музыки, разговоров и смеха молодых людей. Я никому не рассказывал о своих планах, а просто ускользнул от разговора в саду и вошел в дом. Я выпил три бокала вина.\n\nЗамок на двери сменили вскоре после визита Бордена, а когда умерла моя мать, я снова его сменил. Мистер Стимпсон и его жена давно ушли, но они и приходившие за ними экономки использовали подвал под склад. Я всегда слишком нервничала, чтобы даже подняться на верхнюю ступеньку.\n\nВ тот день, однако, я не позволю ничему остановить меня. Некоторое время я готовился мысленно. Оказавшись за дверью, я запер ее изнутри, включил электрический свет и спустился в подвал.\n\nЯ сразу же стал искать аппарат, убивший Ники Бордена, но, что неудивительно, его там уже не было. Однако круглая яма все еще находилась в центре пола подвала, и я подошел и осмотрел ее. Он явно был выкопан с планом в голове, потому что несколько стальных шпал были просверлены в бетонных сторонах через равные промежутки времени, по-видимому, чтобы служить опорами для деревянных прутьев аппарата. В потолке, прямо над центром ямы, находилась большая электрическая распределительная коробка.\n\nЯ заметил, что на потолке от ящика расходятся многочисленные подпалины, и хотя кто-то покрыл их белой краской, они все еще отчетливо проступали.\n\nКроме всего этого, не было никаких признаков того, что аппарат когда-либо был на месте.\n\nСам предмет я нашел несколько минут спустя, когда отправился исследовать коллекцию ящиков, ящиков и больших загадочных предметов, аккуратно сложенных вдоль одной из стен. Вскоре я понял, что именно здесь хранились магические вещи моего прадеда, предположительно после его смерти. Впереди стояли два больших деревянных ящика, каждый из которых был настолько тяжелым, что я не мог сдвинуть их с места. На одном из них черным цветом были выведены названия маршрутов: \"Денвер, Чикаго, Бостон, Ливерпуль (Англия)\". Таможенный манифест все еще был прикреплен сбоку. Держа его под ближайшим фонарем, я увидел, что кто - то написал: \"содержание-научные приборы\". Металлические обручи были прикреплены со всех четырех сторон обоих ящиков,и повсюду были очевидные поручни.\n\nЯ попытался открыть ближайшую из двух, нащупывая край крышки, чтобы найти какой-нибудь способ открыть ее, когда крышка слегка повернулась вверх. Я сразу понял, что нашел части электрического аппарата, который видел в ту ночь, но поскольку он был разобран, вся угроза исчезла.\n\nК внутренней стороне крышки было прикреплено несколько больших листов бумаги, на которых четким почерком были написаны инструкции.\n\nЯ просмотрел первые несколько:\n\n1. Найдите, проверьте и протестируйте локальное заземление. Если этого недостаточно,не продолжайте. См (27) ниже для получения подробной информации о том, как установить, проверить и протестировать заземляющее соединение. Всегда проверяйте цвета проводов; см прилагаемую диаграмму.\n\n2. Если не используется в США или Великобритании. Найдите, проверьте и протестируйте местное электроснабжение. Используйте прибор, расположенный в разделе 4.5.1, для определения характера, напряжения и цикла тока. См (15) ниже для настройки основного трансформирующего блока.\n\n3. проверить надежность местного электроснабжения при сборке аппарата. Если расхождение составляет 25 в, не пытайтесь управлять аппаратом.\n\nИ так далее, тщательный контрольный список инструкций по сборке, используя технические или научные слова и фразы. (Я распорядился сделать копию, которую держу в доме.) Весь список был подписан инициалами \"Ф. К. А\"..\n\nВнутри крышки второго ящика лежал такой же список инструкций, касающихся демонтажа аппарата.\n\nВ этот момент я начал понимать, кем на самом деле был мой прадед. Под этим я подразумеваю ощущение того, что он сделал, на что был способен, чего достиг в своей жизни. До тех пор он был просто предком, дедушкой, у которого были свои дела в доме. Я по-прежнему почти ничего о нем не знал, но наконец-то понял, что он делает и как.\n\n(Позже в том же году я перебрал остальные его вещи, и это тоже помогло мне понять, что он из себя представляет. Комната, служившая ему кабинетом, была завалена аккуратно подшитыми бумагами: корреспонденцией, счетами, журналами, проездными документами, театральными программами. Там хранилась большая часть его жизни, а в подвале хранились еще костюмы и оборудование с его шоу. Большинство костюмов от старости развалилось на куски, и я их выбросил, но кабинетные иллюзии были в рабочем или ремонтируемом состоянии, и, поскольку мне нужны были деньги, я продал лучшие образцы коллекционерам магии. Я также избавился от коллекции магических книг Руперта Энджера. Электрический аппарат я не продал, и он до сих пор лежит в подвале в ящиках.)\n\nСпустившись в подвал, я забыла о своих детских страхах. Когда я вышел из старой коричневой двери и запер ее за собой, мне показалось, что я отбросил что-то нежелательное, что преследовало меня до сих пор.\n\nНо этого было недостаточно. Ничто не могло оправдать тот факт, что я видел, как в ту ночь был жестоко убит маленький мальчик, причем моим собственным отцом.\n\nЭта тайна косвенно влияет на все, что я делаю. Я редко завожу друзей, мне не нужны любовники, карьера меня не интересует. С тех пор как Розали переехала, чтобы выйти замуж, я живу здесь одна, такая же жертва, как и мои родители.\n\nЯ хочу дистанцироваться от безумия, которое вражда принесла в мою семью в прошлом, но по мере того, как я становлюсь старше, я все больше убеждаюсь, что единственный выход-это встретиться с ней лицом к лицу. Я не смогу жить дальше, пока не пойму, как и почему умер Ники Борден.\n\nЕго смерть мучает меня. Наваждение закончится, если я узнаю больше о мальчике и о том, что на самом деле произошло с ним той ночью. Узнав о прошлом своей семьи, я неизбежно узнал и о Борденах. Я выследил тебя, Эндрю, потому что думаю, что ты и я - ключ ко всему этому-ты единственный оставшийся в живых Борден, в то время как я, по сути, последний живой Энджер.\n\nВопреки всякой логике, я знаю, что Ники Борден был тобой, Эндрю, и что каким-то образом ты пережил это испытание.\n\nГЛАВА ПЯТАЯ.\n\nВечером дождь превратился в снег, и он все еще шел, когда Эндрю Уэстли и Кейт Энджер сидели вместе за остатками ужина. Поначалу ее рассказ не вызвал у него никакого отклика, потому что он просто молча смотрел на свою пустую кофейную чашку, вертя в пальцах ложку на блюдце. Потом он сказал, что ему нужно размяться. Он пересек комнату и подошел к окну, чтобы посмотреть на сад. Некоторое время он не менял позы, и Кейт почувствовала, что либо его глаза закрыты, либо он тупо смотрит в темноту.\n\n- Я расскажу вам все, что знаю. Я потерял контакт со своим братом-близнецом, когда мне было примерно столько же лет, сколько вы описываете. Может быть, то, что вы мне рассказали, объяснит это. Но его рождение не было зарегистрировано, поэтому я не могу доказать, что он существует. Но я знаю, что он настоящий. Вы слышали, что у Близнецов есть своего рода связь? Вот в этом я уверен. Кроме того, я знаю, что он каким-то образом связан с этим домом. С тех пор как я приехала сегодня, я чувствую его присутствие. Я не знаю как, и не могу объяснить\".\n\n-Я тоже просмотрела записи, - сказала она. - У тебя нет близнеца.\n\n- Мог ли кто-то вмешаться в официальные записи? Разве это возможно\"?\n\n-Вот это мне и интересно. Если бы мальчика убили, разве это не дало бы кому-то достаточный мотив, чтобы найти способ фальсифицировать записи?\n\n- Может, и так. Все, что я могу сказать наверняка, это то, что я ничего об этом не помню. Там все пусто. Я даже не помню своего отца, Клайва Бордена. Этот ребенок явно не мог быть мной, и абсурдно даже думать, что это был я. Должно быть, это был кто-то другой\".\n\n-Но это был твой отец... а Ники был его единственным ребенком\".\n\nОн отвернулся от окна и вернулся в свое кресло. Он стоял напротив нее за широким столом.\n\n- Послушайте, есть только две или три возможности, - сказал он. - Мальчишкой был я, меня убили, а теперь я снова жив. В этом нет никакого смысла, с какой стороны ни посмотри. Или мальчик, который умер, был моим братом-близнецом, и человек, который убил его, предположительно, это ваш отец, позже сумел изменить официальные записи. Честно говоря, я тоже в это не верю. Или вы ошиблись, ребенок выжил, и это мог быть или не быть я. Или... Я полагаю, вы могли вообразить себе все это\".\n\n- Нет. Мне это и в голову не приходило. Я знаю, что видел. Во всяком случае, моя мать призналась в этом\". Она взяла свой экземпляр книги Бордена и открыла ее на странице, которую ранее отметила клочком бумаги. -Есть и другое объяснение, но оно так же нелогично, как и все остальные. Если тебя не убили в ту ночь, то, вероятно, это был какой-то трюк. То, что я видел в ту ночь, было аппаратом, построенным для сценической иллюзии\".\n\nОна развернула книгу и протянула ему, но он отмахнулся.\n\n-Все это просто смешно, - сказал он.\n\n\"Я видел, как это произошло\".\n\n-Я думаю, вы либо ошиблись в том, что видели, либо это случилось с кем-то другим. Он рассеянно посмотрел на часы. - Вы не возражаете, если я воспользуюсь мобильником? Я должна сказать родителям,что задержусь. И я хотел бы позвонить в свою квартиру в Лондоне\".\n\n-Думаю, тебе лучше остаться на ночь. Миссис Макин приготовит для вас свободную комнату.\n\nОн не двинулся с места. Она положила книгу Бордена на стол между ними, лицом вниз на открытые страницы.\n\n- Чего ты хочешь от меня, Кейт? - сказал он.\n\n- Больше я ничего не знаю. Возможно, я никогда не делал. Я думаю, именно это и произошло, когда Клайв Борден пришел к моему отцу. Они оба чувствовали, что должны попытаться что-то уладить, делали все возможное, но древние различия все еще имели значение\".\n\n-Меня интересует только одно. Мой брат-близнец где-то здесь. В этом доме. С тех пор как ты показал мне вещи своего деда сегодня днем, я все о нем знаю. Он велит мне не уходить, не приходить, не искать его. Я никогда не знала, что его присутствие так сильно во мне. Что бы вы ни говорили, что бы ни показывала запись о рождении, я думаю, что это был мой брат, который приехал сюда в 1970 году, и я думаю, что он каким-то образом все еще здесь\".\n\n\"Несмотря на то, что он не существует\".\n\n- Да, несмотря на это. В то же время мы оба знаем, что в том, что произошло той ночью, есть что-то странное. Или, по крайней мере, ты\".\n\nНа это у нее не было ответа. Она налила себе еще одну каплю бренди, и Эндрю спросил: Есть ли где-нибудь, куда я могу позвонить?\n\n- Оставайся здесь. Это самое теплое место в доме зимой. У меня есть кое-что, что я хочу проверить\".\n\nОна вышла из комнаты, спустилась в главный холл и заглянула в парадную дверь. Там был сплошной слой снега, два или три дюйма. Шума уличного движения не было слышно. Она обошла дом сзади и увидела, что у дровяного сарая собирается сугроб. Миссис Макин была на кухне, поэтому она заговорила с ней и попросила приготовить свободную комнату.\n\nОни с Эндрю остались в столовой после того, как Миссис Макин убрала со стола, сидя по разные стороны открытого камина и разговаривая о разных повседневных вещах; о его проблемах с девушкой, с которой он жил, о ее проблемах с местным советом, который хотел получить часть ее земли для строительства. Но она устала. В одиннадцать она предложила продолжить работу утром.\n\nОна показала ему, где находится свободная комната и какой ванной он может воспользоваться. Он вежливо поблагодарил ее за гостеприимство, пожелал спокойной ночи, и все.\n\nКейт вернулась в столовую, где оставила кое-какие бумаги своего прадеда. Она сидела у камина, размышляя о том давнем происшествии, пытаясь, как делала уже четверть века, понять, что оно означает.\n\nВ этот момент вошла миссис Макин, и Кейт спросила, не приготовит ли она ей кофе без кофеина перед сном. Потягивая кофе, она слушала полуночные новости по радио-4. Свободная комната, в которой находился Эндрю, находилась прямо над головой, и она слышала, как он часто ворочается на древней кровати. Она знала, какой холодной может быть эта комната. В детстве это была ее спальня.\n\nЧАСТЬ ЧЕТВЕРТАЯ.\n\nРУПЕРТ ЭНДЖЕР.\n\n21 сентября 1866 года.\n\nИстория моей жизни\n\n1: Моя история, Меня зовут Робби (Руперт) Дэвиду ЭНДЖЕРУ и мне сегодня 9 девять лет. Я буду писать в этой книге каждый день, пока не состарюсь.\n\n2: Мои предки, у меня их много, но папа и мама-первые. У меня есть один брат: Генри Ричард Ангус Сент-Джон Энджер, и ему 15 лет, он ходит в школу.\n\n3: я живу в Колдлоу-Хаус Колдлоу Дербишир. На этой неделе у меня что-то случилось с горлом.\n\n4: персонал, у меня есть Нэн, есть Грирсон и горничная, которая меняется с другой горничной во второй половине дня, но я не знаю ее имени.\n\n5: я должна показать это, чтобы папа, когда я написал это. Конец. Подпись: Руперт Дэвид Энджер.\n\n22 сентября 1866 года.\n\nИстория моей жизни.\n\n1: Сегодня ко мне снова приходил врач, и со мной все в порядке. Сегодня получил письмо от Генри, моего брата, который говорит, что отныне я должен называть его сэром, потому что он префект.\n\n2: Папа поехал в Лондон, чтобы сидеть в доме. Он сказал, что я глава дома, пока он не вернется. Это значит, что Генри назвал бы меня сэром, но его здесь нет.\n\n3: сказал Это Генри, когда я писал ему.\n\n4: ходил гулять, разговаривал с Нэн, читал Грирсону, который, как обычно, заснул.\n\nМне больше не придется показывать это папе, если я буду продолжать в том же духе.\n\n23 сентября 1866 года.\n\nГорло гораздо лучше. Сегодня ездил кататься с Грирсоном, который много не говорил, но сказал мне, что Генри говорит, что, когда он возьмет дом, он поедет. Я имею в виду, что Грирсон уедет, когда Генри вступит во владение домом.\n\nЯ жду, когда мама придет навестить меня, она сегодня поздно.\n\n22 декабря 1867 года.\n\nВчера вечером была вечеринка для меня и нескольких мальчиков и девочек из деревни,так как это Рождество им разрешено здесь. Генри тоже был здесь, но он не хотел идти на вечеринку из-за других. Он пропустил большое угощение, потому что у нас на вечеринке был волшебник!\n\nЭтот человек, которого звали Мистер Престо, проделывал самые удивительные трюки, какие я когда-либо видел. Он начал с того, что из ниоткуда появились всевозможные баннеры, флаги и зонтики с множеством воздушных шаров и лент. Затем он проделал несколько трюков с игральными картами, заставляя нас выбирать карты,которые он мог угадать. Он был очень умен. Я умолял и умолял, чтобы мне объяснили, как делаются эти фокусы, но мистер Престо мне ничего не говорил.\n\nСегодня утром у меня появилась идея, и я уговорил Грирсона съездить в Шеффилд и купить все фокусы, какие он сможет найти, и посмотреть, нет ли там книг, в которых рассказывалось бы, как это делается. Грирсона не было почти весь день, но в конце концов он вернулся с большей частью того, что я хотел. Он включает в себя специальную стеклянную коробку, в которой можно спрятать птицу, чтобы я мог произвести ее с помощью магии. Я уже выучил трюк, когда могу угадать, какую карту выбрал кто-то другой, и несколько раз пробовал его на Грирсоне.\n\n1 апреля 1873 года.\n\nДомой из школы. Теперь у меня достаточно личной жизни, чтобы писать в этой книге.\n\nМой отец, 12-й граф Колдердейл, умер три дня назад, 29 марта 1873 года. Мой брат Генри получает титул, земли и собственность. Будущее меня,моей матери и всех остальных членов семьи теперь неопределенно.\n\nЗавтра папу похоронят в склепе.\n\nСегодня утром я более оптимистично смотрю на свои перспективы. Сегодня утром я был здесь, в своей комнате, и практиковался в магии. Я считаю, что теперь я достиг уровня производительности, и хотя я еще не полностью проверил это, я часто практиковал новые трюки на товарищах в школе.\n\nЯ хочу, и это мое единственное желание в эту самую печальную из недель, чтобы я могла использовать свою магию, чтобы вернуть папу к его жизни. Эгоистичное желание, потому что оно, несомненно, помогло бы вернуть мою собственную жизнь туда, где она была три дня назад, но также и страстно любящее желание, потому что я любила своего папу и уже скучаю по нему и сожалею о его кончине. Ему было сорок девять лет, и я считаю, что он слишком молод, чтобы стать жертвой сердечного приступа.\n\n2 апреля 1873 года.\n\nПохороны состоялись, и мой отец был похоронен. После церемонии в часовне его тело было перенесено в фамильный склеп, расположенный под Восточным подъемом.\n\nВечер.\n\nМы все собрались в холле под главной лестницей. Сэр Джеффри Фюзел-Хант, поверенный моего отца, вскрыл коричневый конверт, в котором лежал ужасный документ. Я оглянулся на остальных. Там были братья и сестры моего отца с супругами и, в некоторых случаях, с детьми. Люди, которые управляли поместьем и охраняли дичь, патрулировали болота, охраняли фермы и рыбные промыслы, стояли небольшой группой в стороне. В центре полукруглой группы, прямо напротив сэра Джеффри, сидели мы с мамой и слуги позади нас. Перед всеми нами, стоя, скрестив руки на груди, в центре происходящего, доминировал Генри.\n\nСюрпризов не было. Генрих унаследовал отцовский титул, земли и имущество. Маме предоставляется выбор на всю оставшуюся жизнь: либо занять главное крыло Главного дома, либо целиком занять приданое у ворот. Мне разрешено оставаться в комнатах, которые я сейчас занимаю, пока я не закончу свое образование или не достигну совершеннолетия, после чего моя судьба будет решена Генри. Остальная часть семьи должна остаться или быть утилизирована, как считает нужным Генри.\n\nЗавтра я постараюсь решить, как мне жить дальше, и принять это решение прежде, чем Генри сможет сделать это за меня.\n\n3 апреля 1874 года.\n\nКажется уместным вернуться к этому дневнику через год. Я остаюсь в Колдлоу-Хаусе отчасти потому, что до двадцати одного года нахожусь под опекой Генри, моего законного опекуна, но главным образом потому, что этого хочет мама. Генри поселился в Лондоне, откуда ежедневно посещает дом.\n\nПосле смерти папы я позволил себе пренебречь своим ремеслом, но около девяти месяцев назад вернулся к нему. С тех пор я усердно практиковался и пользовался любой возможностью, чтобы наблюдать за исполнением сценической магии. Многие из этих иллюзий мне уже известны, но по крайней мере один раз в каждом спектакле я вижу что-то, что меня волнует или сбивает с толку. После этого начинается охота за секретом. Теперь мы с грирсоном знаем различных магических торговцев и поставщиков, где, проявляя настойчивость, мы в конце концов получаем доступ к тому, что мне нужно.\n\nГрирсон, единственный в нашем доме, знает о моем магическом интересе и честолюбии. Когда мама пессимистично рассуждает о том, что со мной будет, я не решаюсь сказать ей о своих планах, но в глубине души чувствую, что, когда я покину Дербишир, у меня будет карьера. В магических журналах, на которые я подписываюсь, пишут о громадных гонорарах, которые теперь может получить лучший Иллюзионист за одно выступление, не говоря уже о светской славе, которая сопутствует блестящей карьере на сцене.\n\nОднако я жду своего часа, потому что, как только я достигну совершеннолетия, начнется моя настоящая жизнь!\n\n31 декабря 1876 года.\n\nИдмистон Виллас, Лондон Н.\n\nНаконец-то мне удалось достать свои коробки и чемоданы из кладовки, и я провел унылое Рождество, разбирая свои старые вещи, разбирая те, которые мне больше не нужны, и те, которые я рад снова найти. Этот дневник был одним из последних, и я читал его в течение последних нескольких минут.\n\nСлишком много пробелов уже существует. Я вырвала все страницы, где описывала свои ссоры с Генри, а вместе с ними и записи о моих успехах в магии.\n\nКроме того, из моей последней записи, сделанной более двух с половиной лет назад, я вижу, что тогда я ждала, когда мне исполнится двадцать один год, чтобы Генри мог вышвырнуть меня из дома. На самом деле я не стал ждать так долго и взял дело в свои руки.\n\nИ вот я здесь, в возрасте девятнадцати лет, живу в съемной квартире на респектабельной улице в пригороде Лондона, человек, свободный от своего прошлого, и, по крайней мере, в течение следующих двух лет (потому что независимо от того, где я живу, Генри должен продолжать мое содержание), свободный от финансовых забот. Я уже однажды совершал свою магию на публике, но мне за это не заплатили. (Чем меньше будет сказано об этом унизительном случае, тем лучше.)\n\nЯ стал и останусь просто Мистером Рупертом Энджером. Я повернулся спиной к своему прошлому. Никто в этой моей новой жизни никогда не узнает правды о моем первородстве.\n\n1 января 1877 года.\n\nУтренняя почта привезла из Нью-Йорка небольшую посылку с книгами, которых я ждал много недель, и я просматривал их в поисках идей.\n\nЯ люблю выступать. Я изучаю искусство использования сцены, представления шоу, развлечения аудитории потоком остроумных или забавных замечаний... и мне снится смех, вздохи удивления и буря аплодисментов. Я знаю,что могу достичь вершины своей профессии просто благодаря совершенству презентации.\n\nМоя слабость в том, что я никогда не понимаю действия иллюзии, пока она мне не объяснена. Когда я вижу трюк в первый раз, он сбивает меня с толку так же, как и любого другого зрителя. У меня слабое магическое воображение, и мне трудно применить известные общие принципы, чтобы произвести желаемый эффект. Когда я вижу великолепное представление, я ослеплен показанным и озадачен невидимым.\n\nБольшую часть своего месячного содержания я тратил в магических магазинах, где покупал секрет или устройство, которое позволяло мне добавлять тот или иной трюк в мой постоянно расширяющийся репертуар. Чертовски трудно раскрыть секреты, когда их нельзя купить за наличные!\n\nМеня раздражает, что старые маги так ревниво оберегают свои секреты. Сегодня днем я написал письмо в Prestidigitators' Panel, ежемесячный журнал, продаваемый только по подписке, излагая свои мысли о широко распространенной и абсурдной одержимости секретностью.\n\n3 февраля 1877 года.\n\nКаждое буднее утро, с 9 00 до полудня, я патрулирую то, что стало хорошо протоптанной дорожкой между офисами четырех главных театральных агентств, которые специализируются на магических или новых актерах, и вежливо спрашиваю, не могу ли я получить какие-нибудь заказы.\n\nДо сих пор ответ неизменно был отрицательным. Я знаю, что многие безработные исполнители следуют тем же ежедневным путем, что и я. Естественно, я вижу этих других, когда иду по своим заявкам, и, естественно, я подружился с некоторыми из них. Когда мы обедаем в той или иной таверне, я могу предложить им выпить. Я, конечно, пользуюсь популярностью, но я не обманываю себя, что это происходит по какой-то другой причине. Я рад компании, а также более тонкой надежде, что через кого-нибудь из этих приятелей я смогу когда-нибудь установить контакт, который сможет найти или предложить мне какую-нибудь работу.\n\nУ меня достаточно времени, чтобы писать письма. Я стал настойчивым и, как мне кажется, противоречивым корреспондентом на тему магии. Я стараюсь писать в каждый номер магических журналов, которые вижу, и всегда стараюсь быть провокационной. Отчасти я руководствуюсь искренней верой в то, что мир магии сегодня безвкусен, но также и чувством, что мое имя не станет известным, если я не распространю его так, чтобы оно запомнилось.\n\nНекоторые письма я подписываю своим именем; другие-именем, которое выбрал для своей профессиональной карьеры: Дантон. Использование двух имен дает мне некоторую гибкость в том, что я говорю.\n\n16 апреля 1877 года.\n\nГенри сообщил мне через своих поверенных, что мое содержание закончится в день моего двадцать первого дня рождения. Я по-прежнему имею право проживать в Колдлоу-Хаусе, но только в уже отведенных мне комнатах.\n\nУ меня есть до сентября следующего года семнадцать месяцев, чтобы разорвать этот порочный круг неудач в получении работы, ведущих к неудаче стать известным, ведущих к неудаче создать аудиторию для моих навыков, ведущих к неудаче найти работу.\n\n13 июня 1877 года.\n\nНаконец - то мне предложили работу!\n\nЭто не так уж и много, несколько карточных фокусов для выступления на конференции бизнесменов в лондонском отеле, а гонорар всего полгинеи, но это же день красных букв!\n\nДесять шиллингов и шесть пенсов! Более чем недельная арендная плата за эти апартаменты! Поистине богатство!\n\n10 октября 1877 года.\n\nЯ влюблен! Ее зовут Друзилла Макэвой.\n\n15 октября 1877 года.\n\nЭта женщина была не для меня. Я планирую покончить с собой, и если остальные страницы окажутся пустыми, любой, кто наткнется на этот дневник, поймет, что мне это удалось.\n\n22 декабря 1877 года.\n\nТеперь, наконец, я нашел настоящую женщину в своей жизни! Никогда еще я не была так счастлива. Ее зовут Джулия Фенселл, она всего на два месяца младше меня, волосы у нее огненно-рыжие и ниспадают каскадом на лицо. У нее голубые глаза, длинный прямой нос, подбородок с крошечной ямочкой, рот, который, кажется, всегда готов улыбнуться, и лодыжки, стройные формы которых сводят меня с ума от любви и страсти! Она самая красивая молодая женщина, которую я когда-либо видел, и она говорит, что любит меня так же сильно, как я люблю ее.\n\nВ это невозможно поверить. Она вытесняет из моего сознания все тревоги, все страхи, весь гнев, отчаяние и амбиции. Она полностью заполняет мою жизнь.\n\n31 декабря 1877 года.\n\nГод заканчивается, и сегодня вечером, в 11 часов вечера, я присоединяюсь к Джулии, чтобы мы могли быть вместе, когда начнется новый год.\n\nОбщий доход за 1877 год: 5s 3p'.\n\n3 января 1878 года.\n\nЯ встречаюсь с Джулией каждый день с середины прошлого месяца. Она стала моим самым дорогим, самым близким другом. Я должен писать о ней как можно более объективно, потому что мое знакомство с ней уже изменило мою судьбу.\n\nВпервые я встретил Джулию в приемной одного из агентов на Грейт-Портленд-стрит. Она сказала, что она актриса; я сказал, что я иллюзионист.\n\nДжулия-первая, кроме Грирсона, кому я показал свои фокусы наедине. В отличие от Грирсона, который всегда аплодировал всему, что я делал, Джулия была критична и благодарна в равной мере.\n\nИногда, в свою очередь, Джулия декламировала для меня. Меня поразило, что она так много помнит, но она сказала, что есть техники, которые легко усваиваются.\n\nВскоре Джулия заговорила со мной о презентации, о предмете, близком моему сердцу. Наш роман начал углубляться.\n\nВо время рождественских каникул, в то время как весь остальной Лондон праздновал, мы с Джулией были одни в моей съемной квартире, обучая друг друга дисциплинам, к которым каждый из нас привязался. Она приходила ко мне по утрам, оставалась со мной в течение коротких часов дневного света, а затем, вскоре после наступления темноты, я провожал ее до ее собственной квартиры в Килберн. Я проводил вечера и ночи в одиночестве, думая о ней, о том волнении, которое она мне доставляла, о делах сцены, на которую она меня представляла.\n\nДжулия постепенно вытягивает из меня истинный талант, которым, как мне кажется, я всегда обладал.\n\n12 января 1878 года.\n\n\"Почему бы нам, между нами, не придумать магический акт такого рода, который никто до нас никогда не совершал\"?\n\nВот что сказала Джулия.\n\nМы строим менталистский акт! Джулия учила меня технике запоминания. Я изучаю науку мнемоники, использование средств памяти.\n\n26 января 1878 года.\n\nТеперь мы готовы! Представьте себе, что я сижу на сцене с завязанными глазами\". Волонтеры из зала убедились, что я не могу видеть. Джулия ходит среди зрителей, беря предметы их личной собственности и держа их на виду у всех, кроме себя.\n\n\"Что я держу\"? она плачет.\n\n- Это бумажник джентльмена, - отвечаю я.\n\nПублика ахает.\n\n- Теперь я взял...? - говорит Джулия.\n\n\"Это обручальное кольцо из золота\".\n\n-И он принадлежит...?\n\n- Леди, - объявляю я.\n\n(Если бы она сказала: \"который принадлежит \"? Я бы ответил с такой же убежденностью: \"джентльмен\".)\n\n\"Вот я держу\"?\n\n\"Джентльменские часы\".\n\nТак оно и выходит. Обмен заранее подготовленными вопросами и ответами, преподнесенный с достаточным апломбом аудитории, не готовой к спектаклю, явно подразумевает менталистский контакт между двумя исполнителями.\n\nПринцип прост, но учиться трудно. Я все еще новичок в мнемонике, и, как и во всякой магии, практика должна быть совершенной.\n\nПока идет практика, мы можем не думать о самой трудной части - получении ангажемента.\n\n1 февраля 1878 года.\n\nЗавтра вечером мы начинаем! Мы потратили две недели, пытаясь получить твердый заказ в театре или зале, но сегодня днем Джулия предложила взять дело в свои руки.\n\nМы с Джулией посетили в общей сложности шесть таверн в пределах разумной пешей досягаемости и выбрали ту, которая казалась наиболее вероятной. Главный бар представляет собой большое, хорошо освещенное помещение с небольшой приподнятой платформой в одном конце. Столы расставлены так, что Джулия может свободно перемещаться между ними, разговаривая с присутствующими.\n\nДжулия вернулась к себе, и скоро я буду спать. Завтра весь день репетируем.\n\n3 февраля 1878 года.\n\nМежду нами Джулия и я насчитали 2 фунта 4s 9p.\n\nМы не потерпели неудачи! И мы получили дюжину уроков о том, как подготовиться, как заявить о себе, как привлечь внимание.\n\nСегодня вечером мы планируем посетить еще одну таверну, где попробуем еще раз. Мы уже внесли изменения в наш акт, основываясь на опыте субботнего вечера.\n\n4 февраля 1878 года.\n\nТолько 15s 9p между нами, но опять же то, чего нам не хватает в финансовом вознаграждении, мы получили в опыте.\n\n28 февраля 1878 года.\n\nК концу месяца я могу записать, что мы с Джулией заработали в общей сложности 11 фунтов 18 пенсов 3 пенса от нашего менталистского акта.\n\n3-го числа следующего месяца я буду исполнять законный магический акт в Мюзик-Холле Хаскера в Пондерс-Энде; Дантон должен появиться седьмым по счету после певческого трио. Мы с Джулией временно удалились от нашего менталистского представления, чтобы подготовить меня к этому великому событию. Это настоящая работа, в настоящем театре, и это то, над чем я работал все эти годы.\n\n4 марта 1878 года.\n\nПолучил: 3 фунта 3 фунта от мистера Хаскера, который сказал, что хотел бы заказать меня снова в апреле. Особенно популярен был мой трюк с цветными лентами.\n\n12 июля 1878 года.\n\nЯ уже давно не писал в этом дневнике. Мы с Джулией поженились 11 мая и теперь счастливо живем вместе в моем доме. Мы оба чувствуем, что пришло время перемен, хотя мы регулярно зарабатываем деньги. Я еще не могу зарабатывать на жизнь на сцене, и через два месяца я получу последнее из моих ежемесячных пособий.\n\nТеатральные заказы действительно показали недавнее улучшение, и у меня есть шесть из них между сегодняшним днем и Рождеством. Я инвестировал в некоторые крупномасштабные иллюзии. Моя мастерская (которую я приобрел в прошлом месяце) снабжена магическими приспособлениями, из которых я вскоре смогу собрать новое и стимулирующее представление.\n\nРеальная проблема с театральными заказами заключается в том, что, хотя они платят довольно хорошо, они не обеспечивают непрерывности. Отзывы в прессе небольшие и неохотные.\n\nИдея нового направления пришла ко мне (точнее сказать, к Джулии), когда я просматривал ежедневную газету. Я видел сообщение о том, что в последнее время появилось больше свидетельств того, что жизнь, или ее форма, продолжается и после смерти. Некоторые адепты-экстрасенсы могли вступать в контакт с недавно умершими людьми и общаться с их скорбящими родственниками из загробного мира. Я зачитал часть отчета Джулии. Какое-то мгновение она пристально смотрела на меня, и я видел, что ее мозг работает.\n\n-Ты ведь не веришь в это, правда? - наконец сказала она.\n\n-Я отношусь к этому серьезно, - подтвердил я. - В конце концов, все больше людей вступают в контакт. Вы не должны игнорировать то, что говорят люди\".\n\n- Руперт, ты не можешь быть серьезным! - воскликнула она.\n\n-Но эти сеансы были исследованы учеными с самой высокой академической квалификацией, - сказал я.\n\n-Я правильно тебя слышу? Ты, чья профессия-обман!\n\nТут я начал понимать, о чем она говорит.\n\n-Ты всегда говоришь, - продолжала моя любимая Джулия, - что легче всего обмануть тех, кто лучше всех образован. Их разум ослепляет их до простоты магических тайн\"!\n\n- Так вы говорите, что эти сеансы-обычные иллюзии? Я сказал.\n\n-А кем еще они могут быть? - торжествующе воскликнула она. -Это новое предприятие, моя дорогая. Мы должны быть частью этого\".\n\nИтак, мы движемся в мир спиритизма.\n\n31 августа 1878 года.\n\nМы посетили в общей сложности четыре сеанса и знаем, о чем идет речь. Обман, как правило, низкого уровня. Возможно, реципиенты находятся в таком состоянии отчаяния, что они восприимчивы почти ко всему.\n\nМы с Джулией потратили много времени на обсуждение того, как мы могли бы это сделать, и решили, что лучший и единственный способ-думать о наших усилиях как о профессиональной магии, выполненной по самым высоким стандартам. В спиритизме уже слишком много шарлатанов, и я не хочу стать еще одним из них.\n\nЭта работа для меня способ заработать и, возможно, накопить немного денег, пока я не смогу поддерживать себя в театральной карьере.\n\nМы уже подготовили и оплатили наше первое объявление в одной из лондонских газет.\n\n9 сентября 1878 года.\n\nНаше объявление вызвало четырнадцать запросов! Поскольку мы предлагали свои услуги по две гинеи за раз, а реклама стоила мне 3 шиллинга 6 пенсов, мы уже получаем прибыль!\n\nВсе это утро я практиковал технику, известную как веревочный галстук Якоби. Это техника, в которой маг привязан к простому деревянному стулу обычной веревкой, но которая все же позволяет сбежать. При минимальном наблюдении со стороны ассистентки иллюзиониста (в моем случае Джулии) любое количество добровольцев может связать веревку, но все же позволить сбежать. Исполнитель, однажды спрятанный в шкафу, может не только высвободить себя достаточно, чтобы совершить явные чудеса в шкафу, но может впоследствии вернуться к своим узам, чтобы быть найденным, проверенным и освобожденным теми же добровольцами, которые удерживали его.\n\n20 сентября 1878 года.\n\nУ нас есть две гинеи, клиент буквально рыдал от благодарности, и контакт, я скромно говорю, был недолгим.\n\nЗавтра, когда мне исполнится двадцать один год и начнется моя взрослая жизнь во всех отношениях, мы должны провести спиритический сеанс в Дептфорде, и нам нужно многое подготовить!\n\nПервой нашей вчерашней ошибкой была пунктуальность. Наша клиентка и ее друзья ждали нас, и когда мы вошли в дом и попытались установить наше оборудование, они наблюдали за нами. Ничего из этого не должно повториться.\n\nНам нужна физическая помощь. Вчера мы взяли напрокат тележку, чтобы отвезти нас по указанному адресу, но возчик не пожелал помочь нам донести наш аппарат до дома (а это означало, что нам с Джулией придется делать это вдвоем, а некоторые из них тяжелые, а большинство громоздкие). И мы никогда больше не должны зависеть от домашней мебели, которая нам нужна для некоторых наших вещей. Сегодня нам повезло; там был стол, который мы могли бы использовать, но мы не можем рисковать этим в следующий раз!\n\nМногие из этих улучшений уже сделаны. Я сегодня купил лошадь и телегу! (Лошадь будет временно содержаться в маленьком дворике за моей мастерской, пока не будет арендована подходящая конюшня.) И я нанял человека, чтобы он управлял повозкой и помогал нам со всеми нашими вещами. Его зовут Эрнест Ньюджент; это крепко сложенный мужчина лет под тридцать, который до прошлого года был добровольцем в армии Ее Величества.\n\nА теперь нам надо ехать в Дептфорд за следующей! Дептфорд - одна из самых труднодоступных частей Лондона отсюда. Мы с Джулией договорились, что в будущем будем принимать заказы только от людей, живущих на разумном расстоянии от нас, иначе работа будет слишком тяжелой, день-слишком длинным, а финансовое вознаграждение-слишком маленьким.\n\n2 ноября 1878 года.\n\nДжулия ждет ребенка! Ребенок ожидается в июне следующего года. Несмотря на все волнения, которые это вызвало, мы отменили несколько встреч и завтра уезжаем в Саутгемптон, чтобы сообщить новость матери Джулии.\n\n15 ноября 1878 года.\n\nВчера и позавчера мы проводили сеансы; никаких проблем не было, и клиенты остались довольны. Однако меня все больше беспокоит возможное воздействие стресса на Джулию, и я думаю, что должен быстро найти и нанять помощницу для работы со мной.\n\nНа спиритическом сеансе два дня назад (первом после нашего возвращения из Саутгемптона) я запоздало обнаружил, что один из людей, которых я считал родственниками покойного, на самом деле был репортером из газеты. Этот человек выполнял какую-то миссию, чтобы разоблачить меня как шарлатана, но как только мы поняли его цель, мы с Наджентом быстро (но вежливо) удалили его из дома.\n\nПоэтому к этой работе следует добавить еще одну предосторожность-я должен быть настороже против активных скептиков.\n\nИбо я действительно из тех шарлатанов, которых они пытаются дискредитировать. Я не тот, за кого себя выдаю, но мои обманы безвредны и, как мне кажется, полезны в момент личной потери. Что касается денег, которые переходят из рук в руки, то суммы скромные, и до сих пор ни один клиент мне ни на что не жаловался.\n\n20 ноября 1878 года.\n\nСегодня мы с Джулией взяли интервью у пяти молодых женщин, и все они надеются заменить Джулию в качестве моей помощницы.\n\nНи один не подходил.\n\nДжулия чувствует себя постоянно больной в течение двух недель, но теперь говорит, что это начинает улучшаться. Мысль о появлении в нашей жизни маленького сына или дочери озаряет наши дни.\n\n23 ноября 1878 года.\n\nПроизошел особенно неприятный инцидент.\n\nМы отправились в Айлингтон, по адресу неподалеку от \"Ангела\". Клиент был моложавым мужчиной, опечаленным смертью жены и теперь вынужденным справляться с семьей из трех маленьких детей. Этот джентльмен, которого я буду называть Мистером Л, был первым из наших клиентов-спиритистов, пришедших к нам по рекомендации другого. По этой причине мы подошли к назначению с особой осторожностью и тактом, потому что теперь мы понимаем, что если мы хотим преуспеть как спиритисты, то это должно быть спиралью постепенно растущих гонораров, поддерживаемой благодарными рекомендациями довольных клиентов.\n\nМы как раз собирались начать, когда появился опоздавший. Я сразу же заподозрил его. Никто из членов семьи, казалось, не знал его, и его появление вызвало в комнате чувство нервозности.\n\nЯ дал Джулии понять нашим негласным шифром, что подозреваю присутствие газетного репортера, и по выражению ее лица понял, что она пришла к такому же выводу. Я пытался решить, что делать, когда понял, что видел этого человека раньше. Он присутствовал на более раннем сеансе, и я запомнил его, потому что в то время его пристальный взгляд на меня во время моей работы был самым тревожным. Было ли его присутствие опять совпадением? Если это не совпадение, как я подозревал, то в чем же заключалась его игра? Вероятно, он был там, чтобы сделать какой-то ход против меня, но у него был шанс раньше, и он им не воспользовался. А почему нет?\n\nМоя быстрая оценка состояла в том, что по балансу вероятностей я должен продолжать сеанс, что я и сделал. Написав это сейчас, я признаю, что принял неверное решение.\n\nНе поднимая на меня руки, он чуть не испортил мне представление. Я так нервничала, что с трудом могла сосредоточиться. Как только с иллюзией кабинета было покончено, мой враг захлопнул свою ловушку. Он встал из-за стола, оттолкнул плечом беднягу Наджента и опустил жалюзи. Последовало много криков, вызвавших сильное и неконтролируемое горе моего клиента и его детей. Наджент боролся с этим человеком, а Джулия пыталась утешить детей Мистера л.\n\nМужчина в своем безумии схватил Джулию за плечи, оттащил назад, развернул и повалил на пол! Она тяжело упала на не покрытые ковром доски, а я в сильнейшем смятении встал из-за стола, за которым выступал, и попытался дотянуться до нее. Нападавший стоял между нами.\n\nНьюджент снова схватил его, на этот раз удерживая сзади, сцепив руки за спиной.\n\n-Что мне с ним делать, сэр? - Воскликнул Наджент.\n\n\"На улицу с ним\"! - Крикнул я. \"Нет, подожди\"!\n\nСвет из окна падал прямо на его лицо. За его спиной я увидел то, что мне тогда больше всего хотелось увидеть: дражайшая Джулия снова поднималась на ноги. Она быстро дала мне понять, что не пострадала, и я переключил свое внимание на мужчину.\n\n-Кто вы, сэр? - Спросил я его. - Какой у вас интерес к моим делам?\n\n\"Скажи своему человеку, чтобы отпустил меня\"! - пробормотал он. \"Тогда я уйду\".\n\n\"Ты уйдешь, когда я решу\"! Я сказал. Я подошел к нему поближе, потому что теперь узнал. -Вы ведь Борден, не так ли? Борден\"!\n\n\"Это не правильно\"!\n\n- Альфред Борден, в самом деле! Я видел ваши работы! Что ты здесь делаешь?\"\n\n\"Отпусти меня\"!\n\n- Какое у тебя ко мне дело, Борден?\n\nОн ничего не ответил, но яростно вырывался из рук Наджента.\n\n\"Избавься от него\"! - Приказал я. \"Брось его в канаву\"! Наджент выволок несчастного из комнаты и через несколько минут вернулся один.\n\nК этому времени я уже заключил Джулию в объятия и крепко прижимал к себе, пытаясь убедить себя, что она действительно цела и невредима.\n\n-Если он обидел тебя или ребенка - прошептал я.\n\n-Я не ранена, - ответила Джулия. \"Кто он был\"?\n\n- Позже, моя дорогая, - мягко сказала я, потому что слишком хорошо понимала, что мы все еще находимся в хаосе разрушенного сеанса, с разгневанным или униженным клиентом, его несчастными детьми, его четырьмя взрослыми родственниками и друзьями, которые теперь явно потрясены.\n\nЯ сказал им всем со всей серьезностью и достоинством, на которые был способен: \"вы понимаете, что я не могу продолжать\"?\n\nОни выразили свое согласие.\n\nДетей увели, и мы с мистером Л отправились на закрытое совещание.. Он действительно был отзывчивым, умным человеком и сразу предложил нам оставить все дела в том виде, в каком они сейчас стояли, и встретиться снова через день или два, чтобы решить, что делать дальше. Я с благодарностью согласился, и после того, как мы с Наджентом перенесли наш аппарат обратно в тележку, мы отправились домой.\n\nЯ высказал свои подозрения, пока мы ехали в сгущающихся сумерках.\n\n- Это был Альфред Борден, - объяснил я. -Я мало что знаю о нем, кроме того, что он волшебник, едва отличившийся в своем деле. С тех пор как он прервал меня, я пытаюсь вспомнить, откуда я его знаю. Мне кажется, я видел, как он выступал на сцене. Но вряд ли он является крупной фигурой в нашей области\".\n\nЯ пытался понять, почему он так себя вел. Я могла объяснить его нападение на меня только профессиональной ревностью. Какой еще может быть мотив? Мы были практически незнакомы друг другу, и наши пути никогда раньше не пересекались. Однако все его поведение было поведением человека, одержимого жаждой мести.\n\nВскоре мы уже были в Идмистон Виллас, и я сразу же уложил Джулию в постель. Я сидел с ней, пока она не заснула.\n\nЯ уже дважды прерывался, чтобы повидать Джулию, и она мирно спит.\n\n24 ноября 1878 года.\n\nХудший день в моей жизни.\n\n27 ноября 1878 года.\n\nДжулия вернулась из больницы. Сейчас она спит.\n\nДжулия проснулась на рассвете 24-го. Она сильно истекала кровью и мучилась от боли.\n\nЯ тут же оделся, разбудил соседей и попросил Миссис Дженсон встать с постели и посидеть с Джулией, пока я буду искать помощи. Она безропотно согласилась, позволив мне умчаться в ночь. Я наткнулся на извозчика, который, по-видимому, возвращался домой после ночной работы, и умолял его помочь мне. Так он и сделал. Через час Джулия уже была в больнице Святой Марии в Паддингтоне, и хирурги сделали свое дело.\n\nНаш ребенок погиб; я чуть не потерял и Джулию.\n\nОна оставалась в Общественной палате до конца дня и в течение двух последующих дней до сегодняшнего утра, когда мне наконец разрешили забрать ее.\n\nЕсть одно имя, которое теперь неожиданно вошло в мою жизнь, и его я никогда не забуду. Он принадлежит Альфреду Бордену.\n\n31 декабря 1878 года.\n\nОбщий доход от магии за 1878 год: 326 фунтов 19 пенсов 3 пенса. из этого должны быть вычтены расходы, включая наем Ньюджента, покупку и конюшню лошади, покупку костюмов и многое другое.\n\n12 января 1879 года.\n\nМой первый сеанс в новом году, и первый, в котором мне помогала Летиция Суинтон. Летиции еще многое предстоит узнать о магической профессии,но я надеюсь, что она исправится. В конце сеанса я попросил Наджента поторопить меня обратно в Идмистон-Виллас, где я был с Джулией, рассказывая ей о своем дне.\n\nЗдесь меня ждало письмо. Мистер Л решил, что в таком случае он больше не нуждается в сеансе у себя дома, но, тщательно обдумав случившееся, он решил, что мне следует заплатить полный гонорар, как и было условлено. Его оплата была приложена.\n\n15 января 1879 года.\n\nНьюджент, Летиция Суинтон и я провели сеанс сегодня днем. Летиция быстро учится.\n\nВернувшись позже, я попросил Наджента высадить меня в Вест-Энде. Я пошел в театр \"императрица\", где, как я узнал, работал Борден, купил билет и сел в задних партере.\n\nВыступление Бордена было в первой половине программы, и я внимательно следил за тем, что он делал. Он проделал семь трюков разного типа, и из них три были такими, объяснения которым я не знаю. (К завтрашнему вечеру они будут у меня!) Он хороший артист, свои трюки исполняет слаженно, но почему-то обращается к публике с неубедительным французским акцентом. Это заставило меня пожелать, чтобы оскорбить его, как мошенника!\n\nОднако я должен быть терпелив. Я хочу, чтобы моя месть была сладкой.\n\nКогда я вернулся, Джулия была со мной неразговорчива, и даже после того, как я рассказал ей, чем занимался, она оставалась ко мне холодна.\n\nО Юлия! Ты не был таким до того дня!\n\n19 января 1879 года.\n\nВ течение последней недели я прилагал все усилия, чтобы усовершенствовать свою магию, стараясь интенсивным применением восстановить себя в моей предполагаемой профессии. С этой целью я привел в порядок свою мастерскую, выбросил много хлама, починил и перекрасил несколько иллюзий и вообще превратил мастерскую в деловое место, где я мог бы должным образом подготовиться и репетировать.\n\nЯ начал осторожно наводить справки, чтобы со мной работал ingenieur. Мне нужна квалифицированная помощь; в этом нет никаких сомнений.\n\nЯ установил себе график тренировок, которого придерживаюсь абсолютно: два часа каждое утро, два часа каждый день, один час (если позволяет время с Джулией) каждый вечер. Единственные перерывы, которые я себе позволяю, - это когда я действительно работаю.\n\nЯ заказал себе и Летиции новые костюмы, чтобы придать актеру профессиональный лоск.\n\nНаконец, я пообещал себе прекратить сеансы, как только смогу себе это позволить. А пока я беру на себя столько из них, на сколько найдется время, потому что они-мое единственное надежное средство зарабатывать на жизнь. Мои финансовые обязательства огромны. Мне нужно платить за квартиру, за аренду мастерской и конюшни, платить жалованье Нюдженту и Летиции, а вскоре и моему новому ingenieur, а также вести хозяйство и кормить Джулию и себя.\n\n31 декабря 1879 года.\n\nОбщий доход от магии за 1879 год: 637 фунтов 12 пенсов 6 пенсов. До расходов.\n\n31 декабря 1880 года.\n\nОбщий доход от магии за 1880 год: 1142 фунта 7 с 9 пенсов. До расходов.\n\n31 декабря 1881 года.\n\nОбщий доход от магии за 1881 год: 477 фунтов 10 центов. До расходов.\n\n1881 год-последний год, в котором я буду записывать здесь свои доходы. Этот год был достаточно удачным для меня, чтобы купить дом, в котором прежде мы просто снимали квартиру. Теперь мы занимаем все здание, и у нас есть домашний персонал из трех человек. Могу отметить, что я, вероятно, самый популярный иллюзионист в Британии. Мой дневник заказов на следующий год уже полон.\n\n2 февраля 1891 года.\n\nДесять лет назад я отложил свой дневник, намереваясь никогда больше его не открывать, но унизительные события, произошедшие сегодня вечером в театре Сефтона в Ливерпуле, не могут остаться незамеченными.\n\nЯ был во второй части моего выступления, направляясь к тому, что в настоящее время является кульминацией моего выступления. Это подводный побег, эффект, который сочетает в себе физическую силу, определенную долю контролируемого риска и немного магии.\n\nИллюзия начинается с того, что я привязан к металлическому стулу. Для этого я приглашаю на сцену комитет из шести волонтеров; все они-настоящие зрители, ни один из них не посажен, но Эрнест Ньюджент и мой изобретатель Гарри Каттер следят за происходящим.\n\nС комитетом на сцене я вовлекаю их в шутливую беседу, отчасти чтобы успокоить их, отчасти чтобы сбить с толку публику, в то время как Эллен Тремейн (моя нынешняя ассистентка; я уже давно не писал здесь) начинает завязывать веревку Якоби.\n\nОднако сегодня вечером, едва я занял свое место в кресле, как понял, что Альфред Борден-один из членов комитета! Он был шестым! (Мы с Гарри каттером используем коды для идентификации и размещения добровольцев на сцене. На этих подготовительных этапах шестой человек располагается дальше всех от меня и получает задание держать один конец веревки.) Сегодня Борден был шестым, всего в нескольких футах от меня! Зрители смотрели на нас всех! Фокус уже начался!\n\nБорден хорошо сыграл свою роль, двигаясь неуклюже и с хорошо наигранным смущением по поводу своей маленькой роли на сцене. Каттер, явно не понимая, кто он такой, подтолкнул Бордена на свое место. Эллен Тремейн тем временем связывала мне руки и привязывала запястья к подлокотникам кресла. Именно здесь мои приготовления пошли не так, потому что мое внимание было приковано к Бордену.\n\nПод грохот барабанов меня подняли в воздух над стеклянным резервуаром, и я вращался на конце цепи, как беспомощная жертва пыток. По правде говоря, сегодня вечером я так и сделал, но во время обычного представления я бы уже освободил свои запястья и переместил руки в положение, из которого я мог бы их немедленно освободить. (Мое вращение на цепи является эффективным прикрытием для обязательно быстрых движений рук, когда я освобождаюсь.) Сегодня вечером, когда мои руки были неподвижно привязаны к стулу, я могла только в ужасе смотреть вниз на холодную, ожидающую воду.\n\nЧерез несколько мгновений, согласно плану, я погрузился в нее. Когда вода сомкнулась над моей головой, я попытался по выражению лица подать сигнал Каттеру, но он уже был занят опусканием скрывающей завесы вокруг бака.\n\nВ полутьме, полуобвернувшись в кресле, связанный по рукам и ногам, я начал тонуть -\n\nИ все же я пишу это. Очевидно, я сбежал.\n\nВот реконструкция того, что должно было произойти на остальной части сцены, скрытой от меня занавесом.\n\nВ обычном спектакле все, что можно увидеть на сцене, - это комитет из шести человек, застенчиво стоящих вокруг занавеса, который окружает танк. Оркестр играет живую музыку, отчасти чтобы заполнить время, отчасти чтобы замаскировать любые звуки, которые я не могу подавить во время побега. Но время идет, и вскоре и комитет, и зрители начинают чувствовать беспокойство от того, сколько времени прошло.\n\nОркестр тоже отвлекается, и музыка замолкает. Гарри Каттер и Эллен Тремейн с тревогой выбегают на сцену, словно в ответ на чрезвычайную ситуацию, и зрители тревожно шумят. С помощью комитета Каттер и Эллен срывают скрывающий занавес, чтобы показать.\n\nСтул все еще в воде! Веревки все еще обвязаны вокруг него! Но меня там нет!\n\nПока зрители ахают от изумления, я драматически появляюсь. Обычно это происходит из-за кулис, но если у меня есть время, я предпочитаю объявить о себе в середине зала. Я бегу в центр сцены, кланяюсь и убеждаюсь, что все замечают, что моя одежда и волосы совершенно сухие -\n\nСегодня вечером Борден был здесь, чтобы разрушить все это и, возможно, непреднамеренно, спасти меня от безвыходного конца. Задолго до того, как иллюзия должна была закончиться, к счастью, задолго до того, как оркестр заиграл, он покинул место на сцене, куда его поместил Каттер, подошел к занавесу и отдернул его!\n\nПервым моим осознанием этого было то, что на меня обрушился луч яркого света. Я посмотрела вверх с огромной и внезапной надеждой, когда последний воздух из моих легких пузырился вокруг моих глаз! Я почувствовал, что мои молитвы услышаны, что Каттер прервал представление, чтобы спасти мне жизнь. Ничто другое не имело значения в ту секунду, когда вспыхнула надежда. То, что я увидел сквозь ужасные искажения бурлящей воды и укрепленного стекла, было презрительным лицом моего смертельного врага! Он наклонился вперед, торжествующе прижавшись лицом к резервуару.\n\nЯ чувствовал, как во мне поднимается беспамятство, верил, что нахожусь на грани смерти.\n\nТогда возникает разрыв. Следующим моим осознанием было то, что я лежу на твердом деревянном полу, в полутьме, в ледяном холоде, и на меня смотрят лица. Играла музыка, оглушая меня, когда вода большими глотками вытекала из моих ушных проходов. Я чувствовал, как пол ритмично движется вверх и вниз. Я был за кулисами. Когда я поднял голову, то увидел, рассеянный и блуждающий в поле моего зрения, ярко освещенную сцену всего в нескольких футах от меня, где хор шагал по доскам, в то время как корифей маршировал под мелодию из оркестровой ямы. Я застонала от облегчения, закрыла глаза и позволила голове упасть обратно на пол. Каттер оттащил меня в безопасное место, каким-то образом восстановил мое дыхание, положил конец унизительному зрелищу.\n\nВскоре после этого меня перенесли в зеленую комнату, где началось мое выздоровление. Был еще довольно ранний вечер, и я полагал, что у меня есть достаточно времени, чтобы вернуться на сцену и снова попробовать свою иллюзию, прежде чем шоу закончится. Мне не разрешали этого делать. Вместо этого меня проводили на вокзал, где я сел на поезд до Лондона, чтобы повидаться с семьей.\n\nПо иронии судьбы, моя неспособность вести этот дневник была вызвана домашним довольством. Большую часть последнего десятилетия я был не только успешен в своей карьере, но и беспрецедентно счастлив дома.\n\nВ начале 1884 года Джулия снова оказалась беременной и в положенный срок благополучно родила нашего сына Эдварда. Через два года родилась первая из моих дочерей, Лидия, а в прошлом году родилась наша малышка Флоренс.\n\nНа этом фоне вражда с Борденом не имела большого значения. Правда, мы много раз подшучивали друг над другом. Однако до сегодняшнего вечера мы с Борденом не угрожали друг другу напрямую.\n\nКогда-то, много лет назад, Борден был непосредственно ответственен за выкидыш моего первого ребенка. Хотя тогда мой инстинкт был инстинктом мести, по прошествии месяцев мой гнев медленно угас, и я удовлетворилась тем, что поставила его в неловкое положение именно в тот момент, когда он меньше всего наслаждался этим.\n\nВ свою очередь, он несколько раз неожиданно мстил мне.\n\nТо, что произошло сегодня вечером, вынудило нашу вражду выйти на новый уровень. Он пытался убить меня; это совершенно ясно. Он волшебник; он знает, как нужно завязывать веревки, чтобы обеспечить быстрое и безопасное освобождение.\n\nТеперь я снова хочу отомстить. Я надеюсь и молюсь, чтобы время быстро прошло, успокоило мои чувства, принесло мне здравый смысл и спокойствие, чтобы я не действовал так, как сегодня чувствую!",

        "en": "Chapter one. Information Flow is Your Lifeblood.\n\nInformation work is thinking work. When thinking and working together are significantly assisted by computer technology, you have a digital nervous system. It consists of the advanced digital processes that knowledge workers use to make better decisions - to think, act, react, and adapt. Michael Dertouzos of MIT writes that the future \"Information Marketplace\" will require a large amount of special software and complex combinations of human and machine processes - an excellent description of a digital nervous system at work.\n\nDo you view information technology as a way to solve specific problems? Then you're probably only getting a fraction of the benefits that modern computers and software can provide. Instead, you should be creating systems that will deliver information immediately to anyone who can use it - \"digital nervous systems\".\n\nAs the boss of Microsoft, the world's most successful software company, I played a large part in the birth of the Information Age. In this book I explain the idea of a digital nervous system - the use of information technology to satisfy people's needs at work and at home, just as the human nervous system supports the human mind.\n\nLike a living creature, an organization works best if it can rely on a nervous system that sends information immediately to the parts that need it. A digital nervous system can unite all of an organization's systems and processes, releasing rivers of information and allowing businesses to make huge leaps in efficiency, growth, and profits. I have a simple but strong belief: how you gather, manage, and use information will decide whether you win or lose.\n\nThe best way to put distance between your company and the crowd is to do an excellent job with information. There are more competitors today. There is more information available about them and about the market, which is now worldwide. The winners will be the ones who develop a world-class digital nervous system so that information can easily flow through their companies for maximum and constant learning.\n\nI know what you're going to say: no, it's efficient processes! It's quality! It's winning market share and creating brands that are recognized! It's getting close to customers! Success, of course, depends on all of these things. Nobody can help you if your processes aren't efficient, if you don't care about quality, if you don't work hard to build your brand, if your customer service is poor. A bad business plan will fail however good your information is. And bad practice will spoil a good plan. If you do enough things badly, you'll go out of business.\n\nBut whatever else you have on your side today - smart employees, excellent products, loyal customers, cash in the bank - you need a fast flow of good information to make processes efficient, raise quality, and improve the way you put your plan into practice. Most companies have good people working for them. Most companies want to treat their customers well. Good, useful data exists somewhere within most organizations. Information flow is the lifeblood of your company because it enables you to get the most out of your people and to learn from your customers. See if you have the information to answer these questions:\n\n- What do customers think about your products? What problems do they want you to fix? What new features do they want you to add?\n\n- What problems do your partners have as they sell your products or work with you?\n\n- Where are your competitors winning business from you, and why?\n\n- Will customers' changing demands force you to develop new capacities?\n\n- What new markets are appearing that you should enter?\n\nA digital nervous system won't guarantee you the right answers to these questions. But it will free you from the old paper processes so that you'll have the time to think about the questions. It will give you the data to start thinking immediately, and to see the trends coming at you. A digital nervous system will make it possible for facts and ideas to quickly surface from deep in your organization, from the people who have information about these questions and, it's likely, many of the answers. Most important, it will allow you to do all these things fast.\n\nAn old business joke says that if the railroads had understood that they were in the transport business instead of the steel-rail business, we'd all be flying on Union Pacific Airlines. Many businesses have changed their goals in even more basic ways. But it's not always clear where the next growth opportunity is.\n\nMcDonald's has the strongest brand name and market share and a good reputation for quality. But a market analysis recently suggested the company change its business model. McDonald's has occasionally promoted movie-linked toys. The analysis suggested that the company should use its well-known small-profit product to sell the high-profit toys, and not the other way round. Such a change is unlikely, but not unthinkable in today's fast-changing business world.\n\nNo company can assume that its position in the market is safe. A company should constantly be thinking about its options. One company might be hugely successful if it broke into another business. Another company might find that it should stay with what it knows and does best. The most important thing is that a company's managers have the information to understand where they can compete and what their next great market could be.\n\nThis book will help you to use information technology to ask and answer the hard questions about what your business should be and where it should go. Information technology gives you the data that leads to deeper understanding of your business. It enables you to act quickly. It provides solutions to business problems that simply weren't available before. Information technology and business are becoming so tightly linked that you can't talk about one without talking about the other.\n\nThe first step in answering any hard business question is to look at the facts. It's easier to say this than to do it. The principle is illustrated in my favorite business book, My Years with General Motors, by Alfred P Sloan Jr. If you only read one business book, read Sloan's (but don't put this one down to do it). Extraordinary success can follow from positive leadership that's based on information and reason.\n\nDuring Sloan's time as boss, from 1923 to 1956, General Motors became one of the first really complex business organizations in the United States. Sloan understood that a company could not develop a broad business plan or choose the right projects without building on facts and on the understanding of the people in the company. He developed his own understanding of the business by working closely with his staff and by regular personal visits to the company's technical departments. His greatest influence as a manager, however, came from creating working relationships with GM dealers across the country. He constantly gathered information from GM's dealers, and he worked to develop close relationships with them that produced results.\n\nSloan thought that fact-finding trips were very important. So he built an office in a private railroad car and traveled all over the country, visiting dealers. He often saw between five and ten dealers a day. These visits helped Sloan to see that the car business was changing. It was moving from simple selling to trading, as people wanted to trade their old cars when they bought new ones. Sloan saw that GM's relationship with its dealers had to change as well. The manufacturer and the dealers had to become partners. Sloan formed a dealer council to meet regularly with GM's senior executives. He also created a department to handle complaints from the dealers. He paid for economic studies to find the best places for new dealers, and even found a way to lend money to \"capable men\" who did not have the cash to become dealers.\n\nAccurate information about sales was still hard to find. When a dealer's profits went down, GM didn't know why. Without the facts, it was impossible to know what to do. Sloan said he would pay a lot of money so that every dealer \"could know the facts about his business and could intelligently deal with the many details... in an intelligent manner\". This would be \"the best investment General Motors ever made\".\n\nSloan created a standardized system of accounts for the entire GM organization and all its dealers. Every dealer and every employee, at every level of the company, put their numbers into exactly the same categories. By the mid-1930s GM's dealers, its factories, and its offices could all do detailed financial analysis using the same numbers. A dealer, for example, could clearly see how well he was doing and also compare his results to the average across the company.\n\nAn infrastructure that provided accurate information led to a company that responded quickly to events. Other car makers could not compete with GM for decades. This infrastructure - what I call a company's nervous system - helped GM to dominate the car business throughout Sloan's career. It wasn't yet digital, but it was extremely valuable.\n\nOf course, you couldn't get nearly as much information flowing through your company then as you can now. It would have required too many phone calls and too many people moving paper around and looking at the data to find patterns. It would have been very expensive. If you want to run a world-class company today, you have to obtain much more data and do it much faster. To manage with the force of facts - one of Sloan's business principles - requires information technology.\n\nIf information management and quick responses made such a basic difference in a traditional industry seventy years ago, how much more difference will they make when they are powered by information technology? A modern car maker may have a strong brand name and a reputation for quality today but it is facing even greater competition from around the world.\n\nAll car makers use the same steel and the same machines; they have similar manufacturing processes and they have roughly the same transport costs. Today the tests of success are how well they design their products, how intelligently they use information from their customers to improve their products and services, how quickly they can improve their production processes, how cleverly they market their products, and how efficiently they deliver their products and services to customers. All of these processes are rich in information and they benefit from digital technology.\n\nThe value of a digital approach is especially clear in businesses such as banks and insurance companies where information is central to the business. In banking, data about customers is the heart of the business, and banks have always been big users of information technology. Crestar Bank of Richmond, Virginia, offers all its banking services over the Internet. It has bank employees in supermarkets and malls who can offer banking services to customers using digital information flow.\n\nIn the age of the Internet and increasing competition in financial markets, the key to success is the intelligence of a bank's use of data and how well it responds to its customers. It's brains that give one bank or another the advantage. But I don't just mean the individual abilities of bank employees. I mean the overall ability of the bank to make use of the best thinking of all its employees.\n\nAfter the introduction of ENIAC, the first general-purpose computer, during the Second World War, computers quickly proved that they were faster and more accurate than humans at many tasks. Computers were not working at a high level, though. They assisted people but not in an intelligent way. It takes brains to understand the physics of a rocket; it takes a computer to do the sums in seconds.\n\nBusinesses need to do another kind of work, \"information work\". This phrase comes from Michael Dertouzos, director of MIT's laboratory for computer science, and author of What Will Be. We usually think of information-a letter, a picture, or a financial report-as something that doesn't change. But Dertouzos argues that another form of information is active. Information work is the processing of information by human brains or computer programs.\n\nInformation work-designing a building, making a deal, filling in tax forms-is most of the work done in developed countries. Dertouzos estimates that information work contributes 50 to 60 percent of the total value of the goods and services produced by an industrialized country.\n\nDertouzos's idea is important. When computers went from simple number-work to modeling business problems, they began to play a part in information work. Even manufacturing firms have always put more energy into information about the work than into the work itself: information about product design and development; about marketing, sales, and supplies; about payments and finance; about cooperating with sellers; about customer service.\n\nTo do information work, people in the company have to be able to find information easily. Until recently though, we've been told that \"the numbers\" should be reserved for the most senior executives. Sometimes there are good reasons for secrecy, but usually information has been reserved simply because it took time, money, and effort to move information around, so you had to be senior to order the work. On today's computer networks you can find and present data easily and cheaply. You can dive into the data to the lowest level of detail and look at it from different angles. You can exchange information and ideas with other people. You can bring together the ideas and work of many people for a better result.\n\nWe need to stop thinking that getting information and moving information around is difficult and expensive. It's just basic common sense to make all of your company's data easily available to every person who can use it.\n\nAll of a company's employees, not just its high-level executives, need to see business data. It's important for me as a Chief Executive Officer, (CEO), to understand how the company is doing across regions or product lines or different types of customer, and I take pride in staying informed. However, it's the middle managers in every company who need to understand where their profits and losses come from, what marketing programs are working or not, and what expenses are under control or too high. They're the people who need accurate, useful data because they're the ones who need to act. They shouldn't have to wait for upper management to bring information to them. Companies should spend less time protecting financial data from employees and more time teaching them to analyze and act on it.\n\nIn many companies the middle managers can drown in day-to-day problems and not have the information they need to fix them. A sign of a good digital nervous system is that middle managers are made more effective by the flow of accurate, useful information. The systems should tell them about unusual events-for example, if an expense item is too high. Then the managers don't need to look at normal expense activity. Some companies work like this, but I'm constantly surprised by how few companies use information technology to keep their middle managers well-informed and avoid routine review.\n\nI'm amazed by the twisted path that important information often takes through many Fortune 500 companies. At McDonald's, until recently, sales data had to be \"touched\" by hand several times before it made its way to the people who needed it. Today McDonald's is installing a new information system that processes sales at all of its restaurants in real time. As soon as you order two Happy Meals, a McDonald's marketing manager will know. So that manager will have hard facts to analyze sales, not unreliable data.\n\nAs we'll see in the description of Microsoft's reaction to the Internet, another sign of a good digital nervous system is the number of good ideas coming from your middle managers and knowledge workers. When they can analyze real data, people get detailed ideas about how to do things better-and they get excited, too. People like knowing that something they're doing is working and they like being able to show managers that it's working. They enjoy using technology that encourages them to test different theories about what's happening in their markets. People really appreciate information.\n\nA final sign of a good digital nervous system is how effective your face-to-face meetings are. Good meetings are the result of good preparation. Meetings shouldn't be used mainly to present information. It's more efficient to use e-mail so that people can analyze data before the meeting. Then they will be prepared to make suggestions and debate the issues at the meeting itself.\n\nCompanies that are struggling with too many unproductive meetings don't lack energy and brains. The data they need exists somewhere in the company in some form. Digital tools would enable them to get the data immediately, from many sources, and to analyze it from many angles.\n\nGM's Alfred Sloan said that without facts it's impossible to put an effective plan into action. I believe that if you have good facts, you can put an effective plan into action. Sloan did, many times over. At the speed business moves today, we need more than ever to manage with the force of facts.\n\nWhat I'm describing here is a new level of information analysis that enables knowledge workers to turn raw data into active information-what Michael Dertouzos calls knowledge-as-a-verb. A digital nervous system enables a company to do information work with more efficiency, depth, and creativity.\n\nCan your digital nervous system do this?\n\nLike a human being, a company needs an internal communication system, a \"nervous system,\" to organize its actions. All businesses concentrate on a few basic things: customers, products and services, earnings, costs, competitors, delivery, and employees. A company has to carry out the business processes in each area and make sure that they are working together, especially activities that cross departments.\n\nThe sales department needs to find out quickly whether the company can supply a product before promising to deliver a big order. The manufacturing department needs to know what product is selling strongly so that it can change production priorities. Business managers throughout the company need to know about both-and a lot more, too.\n\nAn organization's nervous system has parallels with our human nervous system. Every business has some processes that must continue for the company to survive, just as the human heart must keep beating. The need to be efficient and reliable has driven companies to automate many of these basic operations. But because managers have taken whatever solution was available, the result over time has been a large number of systems that don't always work together. Each independent system may work smoothly on its own, but the data in each is isolated and difficult to combine with the data in the others. Getting data about operational processes and using it has been one of the more difficult problems of business. But today's technology can make basic operations the basis of a much broader, company-wide intelligence.\n\nA company needs to respond quickly and well to any crisis or unplanned event. You might get a call from your best customer saying he's buying from your biggest competitor, or that competitor might introduce a great new product, or you might have a faulty product or an operation that breaks down. Unplanned events can be positive, too. You might get an unexpected opportunity for a major new activity or purchase.\n\nFinally, there's the conscious directing of your company's muscles, whether you're creating teams to develop new products, opening new offices, or sending people out to win new customers. To be carried out well, these planned events need careful thinking and strategic analysis before and after you act.\n\nYou need to think about your company's basic business issues, and develop a long-term business plan to solve problems and take advantage of the opportunities your analysis reveals. Then you need to communicate what you want to do, and the plans behind it, to every person in the company and to partners and other relevant people outside the company.\n\nMore than anything, though, a company has to communicate with its customers and act on what it learns from them. This primary need involves all of a company's capacities: operational efficiency, data gathering, cooperation, strategic planning, and action. The need to communicate with your customers will be emphasized again and again in this book. I'll show how a digital nervous system helps successful companies to do this.\n\nA digital nervous system serves two primary purposes in developing business understanding. It extends the individual's capacity for analysis the way machines extend physical capacities, and it combines the abilities of individuals to create a company intelligence and act as one. To put it all together: A digital nervous system seeks to create company excellence out of individual excellence to serve the customer.\n\nA digital nervous system gives the people working for your company the same kind of data for daily business use that you give to someone you bring in to consult them about a problem. With their years of experience in the industry and their knowledge of business analysis, consultants often come in with new ideas after they have gone through the data. But isn't it crazy that someone outside the company receives more information than you use for yourself? Too often important customer and sales information is pulled together only when a consultant arrives. You should have that information there every day ready to be used by your employees. Your managers should have information of the same quality that the consultant has. As we'll see in the following example, good things happen when they have that information.\n\nAt Microsoft, our sales team calls only on large corporations.\n\nSo every year Jeff Raikes, the man in charge of sales and support, struggles with the problem of how to market to small and medium-sized customers. We usually reach these customers through seminars and marketing with partners. But where are most of these customers? Are they all in the largest cities? Which cities should we choose for marketing?\n\nFrom the Internet, we found the average number of employees per company per city. From outside consultants we got information on the number of personal computers (PCs) per city. From our marketing managers we got information on our seminars and our work with partners. Finally, we included the number of partners per city.\n\nUsing computers, we looked for a match between sales numbers and marketing activity. A Microsoft software program, MS Sales, gave us data in two important areas: last year's sales data, which helped us calculate growth, and income from sales by postal area. We found eighty cities that we thought were likely candidates for a new marketing campaign. But at Microsoft, before we invest money we want to know if the idea will work. We checked the eighty cities again using a marketing program, looking for an eight to one return on investment (ROI). Setting the ROI as high as eight to one would help us take out any cities where the percentage return might be high, but the absolute dollar return would be low. This gave us forty-five cities, later reduced to thirty-eight.\n\nIn each of those thirty-eight cities in which we hadn't done any marketing before, we held two \"Big Day\" events. On each Big Day we showed Microsoft products and made sales offers, with our partners. The ROI was an amazing twenty to one - $30 million return on $1 and half million investment. As the Big Day events happened, we used the MS Sales program to measure our return against figures in similar markets to see if the Big Days were really making a difference. The results: cities in which we did Big Day events showed a 57 percent increase in income against a 16 percent increase in income in a control group of nineteen small cities that did not have Big Days.\n\nToday the program which identified the target cities has been improved, so that anybody in the company can see future sales opportunities not just by area, but by product, too. So instead of a seminar with all Microsoft products, we can find out if one city needs a seminar on Microsoft Office, another on Windows, and a third on Exchange.\n\nAll that was because of the MS Sales program. A paper system could not do that work. The sales data now comes to us in a way that lets us put it into MS Sales immediately. This is inexpensive, and because we share this data with our partners, discussions with them about future marketing plans achieve better results. These discussions are still old fashioned face-to-face meetings, but everybody at those meetings is better prepared because of the data they have seen in advance.\n\nAt Microsoft our information systems have also changed the role of our managers. When MS Sales first came online, one of our managers in Minneapolis checked sales in her area at a level of detail not possible before. She discovered that the excellent total sales figures for her district hid poor sales to large customers. Finding that out came as a shock to the large customer sales team, but it was also the first step toward putting things right. By the end of the year Minneapolis was the fastest growing area for sales to large customers.\n\nIf you're a manager at Microsoft today, you must be more than a good sales team leader. Now you can be a business thinker because you have the data to help you run your business. You can look at sales figures and see where your business is strong and where it is weak, and which products you can sell, in which areas, to which size firms. You can try out new programs and look at the results. You can talk to other managers about what they're doing to get good results. Managers at Microsoft have a much more important role now than they did five years ago because of the easy-to-use computer programs that we've developed.\n\nA digital nervous system gives its users an understanding and an ability to learn things that they would not otherwise have. A good flow of information and good tools for analysis let us see new opportunities for profit among large amounts of data. It makes the best use of the capacities of human brains and reduces human labor.\n\nTo begin creating a digital nervous system, you should first develop an ideal picture of the information you need to run your business and to understand your markets and your competitors. Think hard about the facts you need to know. Develop a list of the most important questions for your business. Then demand that your information systems provide the answers. If your current system won't do this, you need to develop one that will. If you don't, one or more of your competitors will.\n\nYou know you have built an excellent digital nervous system when information flows through your organization as quickly and naturally as thought in a human being, and when you can use technology to organize teams of people as quickly as you can direct an individual. It's business at the speed of thought.\n\nDigital technology can completely change your production processes and your business processes. It can also free workers from slow paper processes. Replacing paper processes with digital processes frees knowledge workers to do more useful work. The all-digital work place is usually called \"the paperless office,\" a phrase that goes back to at least 1973. It's a great vision. No more piles of paper in which you can't find what you need. No more searching through heaps of reports to find marketing information or a sales number. But the paperless office never seems to actually arrive.\n\nThe Xerox Corporation did more to promote the concept than any other company. In 1974-5 it was talking about the \"office of the future\" that would have computers and e-mail with information online. Between 1975 and 1987 several business newspapers promised that the paperless office wasn't far off but in 1988 I told a journalist, \"This vision of a paperless office is still very, very far away\".\n\nToday we have all the pieces in place to achieve the paperless office. Better computers and software make it easy to combine data of various types. Highly capable, networked PCs are everywhere in the office environment. The Internet is connecting PCs around the world. But paper use has continued to double every four years, and 95 percent of all information in the United States remains on paper, compared with just 1 percent stored electronically. Paper is increasing faster than digital technology can reduce it!\n\nIn 1996 I decided to look at ways that Microsoft was still using paper. To my surprise, we had printed 350,000 paper copies of sales reports that year. I asked for a copy of every paper form we used. The thick file that landed on my desk contained hundreds and hundreds of forms. Paper use was only a sign of a bigger problem, though: administrative processes that were too complicated and took too much time.\n\nI looked at the file and wondered, \" Why do we have all these forms? Every person here has a PC. We're connected up. Why aren't we using electronic forms and e-mail\"? As Chief Executive Officer I gave the order to ban all unnecessary forms. In place of all that paper, systems grew up that were more accurate and easier to work with and that freed our people to do more interesting work.\n\nNow, even before we employ a new worker, he or she starts on an electronic journey. We receive career information from 600 to 900 people applying for jobs every day, through the post, by e-mail at resume@microsoft.com. or at the Microsoft website at www.microsoft.com/jobs. Seventy percent of the career information now arrives by e-mail or to the website, up from 6 percent two years ago and rising. All career information from people applying for jobs is matched with open jobs within forty-eight hours, sometimes within twenty-four hours.\n\nA software program sets up job interviews. Every interviewer gets career details of the person applying for the job by e-mail. After the interview each interviewer sends comments on the candidate by e-mail. This sharing of information makes sure that interviewers build on each other's work, not repeat it. If it is obvious that Microsoft wants the candidate, an e-mail signal tells the interviewer to explain to that person why Microsoft would be a good choice for them.\n\nLet's say that someone called Sharon Holloway accepts our job offer. The imaginary Sharon is one of the eighty-five new people we employ each week. We'll say that Sharon is at Redmond, Washington. Before Sharon arrives at Microsoft, an administration assistant in her new department fills out the New Hire form on Microsoft's intranet to request office furniture, and a computer with software, e-mail, and voice mail to be ready for Sharon. The same form makes sure that Sharon's name is added to the company phone list and that she gets a nameplate for her office door and a mailbox in the building's mailroom.\n\nWhen she arrives, Sharon goes online to read the employee handbook (it doesn't exist on paper now) and she downloads any software she needs. Next, Sharon uses a program called MS Market to order office supplies, books, a whiteboard, and business cards. MS Market automatically puts in her name, her e-mail address, and the name of her manager on the order. The suppliers receive her request by e-mail and deliver the supplies to her office. An order above a certain amount of money would automatically go to a manager before it went to the supplier.\n\nSharon's paycheck goes into her account by e-mail and if she wants to she can change her bank online. For travel, Sharon uses a program designed by Microsoft in partnership with American Express, called AXI. It's available online twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nSome people think that \"Microsofties\" have no life outside the company, but actually they do. Sharon gets married and goes on vacation with her new husband. She enters her vacation time online. When she and her husband move into a new house, Sharon enters her new address online once and it is automatically sent to every department that needs her address. She visits our intranet to get information about bus routes and ride sharing in her new neighborhood.\n\nWhen Sharon and her husband have a baby, she goes online to learn about seminars for parents, paid time off work for parents, and day care for children. Microsoft pays a certain amount in benefits to every person the company employs and they can take these benefits in many ways. They can look at different ways of combining benefits online. She can also buy and sell shares online, using the company that buys and sells shares for everybody employed at Microsoft, Saloman Smith Barney. Sharon can buy and sell shares in Microsoft and use her vote as a shareholder online.\n\nUsing our computer network to replace paper forms has produced impressive results for us. As I write this book, we have reduced the number of paper forms from more than 1,000 to a company-wide total of sixty forms. Overall, the savings from using electronic forms have amounted to at least $40 million in our first twelve months of use in 1997-8. The biggest savings came from the reduction in processing costs. Accounting firms put the cost of each paper order - mostly the time of all the people handling the paper - at about $145. Electronic processing at Microsoft costs less than $5 per order.\n\nAs we invented new solutions, our central information-technology budget, which covers these and other major business areas, decreased 3 percent between 1996 and 1999, mostly from standardizing data and reducing the number of information systems we have.\n\nElectronic tools give us benefits beyond reducing costs. For example, our Microsoft Market software asks for authority before it will process a request. This prevents the inappropriate purchases that can easily get through a paper-based system. Delivery information is typed instead of handwritten, so almost nothing is ever sent to the wrong destination. Communication with our suppliers is documented, and we know the costs in advance so there are no surprises. Our suppliers get paid faster, which means they want to deliver quickly. We're always discovering new benefits.\n\nThe move from paper to electronic forms is an essential step in developing a modern organization's nervous system, but you should use the change to improve processes that are central to your business. A digital nervous system is easy to build on. A good network, a good e-mail system, and easy-to-build webpages are everything you need for getting rid of internal paper forms, too. Our internal tools have two goals: to use software to handle routine tasks, so that our knowledge workers don't waste time and energy; and to free people to do more difficult work and handle unusual situations. Our internal developers use the \"sort-boiled egg\" rule: A user must be able to get into and out of most administrative tools within three minutes. This makes sure that we don't create clumsy tools and cause more work overall.\n\nImproving administrative and internal business processes is an important way to improve the overall efficiency of your employees. When you give knowledge workers good internal tools, you also send them an important message: when employees see a company improve efficiency and get rid of time-draining routine administrative tasks, they know that the company values their time and wants them to use it profitably.\n\nIt's easy to measure when you make your factory workers more efficient. It's hard to measure when you make your knowledge workers more effective, but it makes sense that workers who aren't burdened by routine tasks will do better work. The benefit to customers is that your employees spend less time on paperwork and more time on customer needs.\n\nChapter two.\n\nCommerce: The Internet.\n\nChanges Everything.\n\nRide the rocket of change.\n\nNot long ago I gave a talk to the board of directors of a German financial institution. These were experienced businesspeople. The youngest person there was probably fifty-five, and many of them were in their sixties. They'd seen a lot of changes in banking and they'd lived through a lot of technology changes, too. The bank had not yet, though, begun to use the new Internet technologies.\n\nOn the day of my visit they'd heard a series of talks from Microsoft employees about the company. When I walked into the room, they were all sitting there with their arms folded across their chests, looking unhappy.\n\n\"OK,\" I said\". What's the problem\"?\n\nOne of them replied, \"We think that banking is in the process of changing completely, and we're getting technical talks from people here at Microsoft - more technical than we're used to\". He took his glasses off and rubbed his eyes and said, \"This is probably good, although it's making us tired\". After a pause he continued: \"It's good that you're just going to make all of your products better, but what is the overall plan? To view you as a long-term supplier, we need you to give us a vision of the future. What are your organizing principles for development\"?\n\nThe senior Microsoft executive who ends a meeting with customers doesn't usually bring a prepared talk. Instead, the person answers questions and makes a summary of what we'll do in response to any important issues that have come up. So as I stood in front of the German bankers I was thinking, \"Oh boy. We've spent eight hours talking to this bank and we haven't answered the customer's central concerns. Now I've got to do it without notes\"...\n\nBut by that time I'd given my talk on the digital nervous system a couple of dozen times, and I'd been working on this book for almost a year. So I began to write down the major changes that I thought were going to happen with technology in the near future. I was writing down ten changes that I thought would have a significant effect on industries, I told the bankers. These were important changes in customer behavior that were all related to digital technology and were all happening now.\n\n\"I'm going to ask you whether you believe each of them will happen. Don't worry now about how quickly, just tell me whether you believe they're ever going to occur. If you don't believe they will, then you shouldn't change what you're doing with technology. But if you believe they're going to happen, and it's only a matter of time, then you should start to prepare for that change today\".\n\n\"Do you believe that in the future people at work will use computers every day for most of their jobs\"? I asked. \"Today a lot of people use computers occasionally, but many knowledge workers may use their PCs only a few times a day. They may even go a couple of days without using PCs. Do you believe that today's paperwork will be replaced by more efficient digital processes\"? They did.\n\n\"Do you believe that one day most homes will have computers? In the United States today, about half of all homes have PCs. The percentage is a bit higher in some countries but much lower in most others. Do you believe,\" I asked, \"that one day computers will be as common in homes as telephones or TVs\"? They did.\n\n\"Do you believe that one day most businesses and most homes will have high-speed connections to the World Wide Web\"? I asked. They nodded agreement.\n\n\"Do you believe e-mail will become as common a method of communication among people in business and homes as the telephone or paper mail is today? Today not everybody uses e-mail even if they have a computer. Will that situation change\"? They agreed that it would.\n\n\"Now, if most people have computers and use them every day,\" I asked, \"do you believe that most information will start arriving in digital form? Do you think your bills will arrive electronically? Do you think you'll be booking your travel arrangements over the Internet\"? They agreed that these changes were coming.\n\n\"Do you think digital equipment will become common\"? I asked. \"Do you think that all phones, cameras, videos, and TVs will soon be digital? Do you think that other new machines will appear in the home and be connected to the Web\"? It was only a matter of time, they agreed.\n\n\"Do you see a time coming when notebook computers become computer notebooks\"? I described what I meant: a computer notebook is a new machine that enables you to take notes as you do today on paper and lets you carry with you all the personal and professional data you need. This will probably be the last change to occur. \"The great thing about a computer notebook,\" I said, \"is that however much you put into it, it doesn't get bigger or heavier\". They laughed. There was a thirty-second conversation in German before one of them said, \"We thought you said something funny, and then we realized you said something important\".\n\n\"Am I wasting your time\"? I asked. \"Do you believe these changes are ever going to happen\"? By now we were beginning to have a conversation. They had a short talk among themselves in German. The banker who had spoken before said, \"We've been talking about the same things at home and, yes, we believe it's going to happen. When it does, it's going to completely change the nature of banking\".\n\n\"When do you think it is going to happen\"? I asked. They had another, longer conversation in German. Then they said, \"We didn't expect to make this decision here, but we have. We were going to tell you twenty years, but then we decided that within ten years these changes will either have arrived or becoming very soon. Banking will be completely different\".\n\n\"To prepare for that change,\" I told them, \"you need to make digital information flow everywhere in your organization\". I talked briefly about the need to use the digital tools that they already had for their knowledge workers. I talked about digitally linking their knowledge systems with business information systems to create a new infrastructure around the PC and Internet technologies. If they did these things, I told them, they would be prepared for the three basic business changes that will occur as the result of all the technological advances:\n\n1: Most of the contact between business and customers, business and business, and people and government will become digital and self-service.\n\n2: Customer service will become the primary way of adding value in every business. Human involvement in service will shift from routine, low-value tasks to high-value personal service to the customer.\n\n3: The speed of digital operations and the need for more personal attention to customers will encourage companies to adopt digital processes internally if they have not yet adopted them for efficiency reasons. Companies will use a digital nervous system to regularly adapt their internal business processes to an environment that constantly changes because of customer needs and competition.\n\nComplex customer-service and business problems would require powerful computers on both sides of the relationship - customer and employee-I said. The new relationships would be helped by various electronic aids such as voice, video, and interactive use of the same computer screen. We'd see a world in which fairly simple personal-companion computers became common alongside extremely powerful general-purpose PCs that support knowledge work at home or the office.\n\n\"Microsoft's vision,\" I ended by saying, \"is to provide software that links all these digital machines together and enables people to create digital solutions based on the Web lifestyle. It's as simple as that\".\n\nThe German bank board had a final question for me, which is the question on everyone's mind: what should they do personally to get ready for this new digital world? My answer was: use the tools yourselves. Senior executives should use e-mail and other electronic tools to get familiar with the new way of doing things.\n\nThey should see what their competitors' Internet sites look like. They should become Internet users. Buy some books and arrange some travel over the Internet, I told them, and see what it's like. If you're going to lead the digital age, you need to become familiar enough with the Internet to be able to imagine what the Web lifestyle will mean for your industry-even if the change is going to take years.\n\nFor years and years enthusiasts have been saying that the Internet will happen \"tomorrow\". You're going to keep reading predictions that the big change will happen in the next twelve months. This is just garbage. The social changes that have to occur take years, and the infrastructure has to be extended. But when the social and technical changes reach a certain point, the change will be quick and permanent. The point will come where the Web lifestyle really will take off, and I believe that's some time in the next five years. As I said in The Road Ahead, we always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten. Don't let yourself be fooled into doing nothing.\n\nIt's hard to think of a business category in which the Internet won't have an effect or in which there aren't already new Internet companies. Lots of firms now wish they were the first Internet book store or travel agency, winning the first customers, the public enthusiasm, the famous name.\n\nInternet companies are not just learning new ways to do business. They are also rushing to break down the barriers between different areas of business. Amazon.com, which began as an Internet bookseller, has begun to sell CDs. There's no reason for Amazon not to sell other products as well. The initial reason for your company to go onto the Web might be to obtain cost savings and attract new customers. When you have customers interacting with you, you have an amazing ability to build on that relationship to offer a broader set of products.\n\nAn Internet business is not like a bank branch where you can train employees on only a small number of products. The virtual nature of the Internet enables whatever shopping your customers want to do. You'll see more companies like Amazon, that are strong in one online area and then expand their product offerings. The warning to every business is that even if no one in your industry jumps in early, big online companies, trying to cover every commercial area, will move into yours.\n\nLearn about the Internet today. Find some of your customers who are already adopting the Web lifestyle. Use this group to develop models for how you might do business overall. Within a decade most of your other customers will have made the shift, and you'll be prepared.\n\nThe middleman must add value\n\nHere at the start of the twenty-first century, a basic new rule of business is that the Internet changes everything. Internet technologies are altering the way every company, even a small one, deals with its employees, partners, and suppliers.\n\nNot every company needs to use the Internet to interact with its customers right now, but soon a company website where customers can do business with the firm will be as essential as the telephone and a mailing address have been. Already the great majority of Fortune 500 companies have websites. The Internet is reducing costs and changing the relationships of companies with their customers. The Internet produces more competition among sellers and helps sellers to find possible customers.\n\nIn pre-Internet days, the only way customers could get goods from most manufacturers was through layers of middlemen.\n\nToday customers can do business directly with manufacturers eager to offer Internet service. Today any manufacturer can provide the Internet version of a factory store.\n\nBefore the Internet, gathering all the information for financial services, travel options, and other products required lots of time. Huge numbers of service companies made their money by collecting and organizing that kind of information for customers. Today, despite search tools that aren't perfect, customers can go to the Internet to find much more of the information they need. And any company can provide valuable information cheaply on the Internet, without branch offices.\n\nIn 1995, in The Road Ahead, I described how the Internet is helping to create Adam Smith's ideal market, in which buyers and sellers can easily find one another without taking much time or spending much money. The first problem in most markets is finding someone to do business with. The second problem is understanding the nature and quality of the goods and services that are being offered. The Internet makes it easy for a buyer to get background information about a product and to compare prices easily. Buyers can also tell sellers more about what they require, and sellers will be able to target their goods at the people who are most interested in them and sell related products.\n\nThe Internet is a great tool for helping customers to find the best deal they can. It is quite easy for buyers to jump from one website to another to find the best prices on some goods. At least two different services provide price comparisons for customers shopping for goods such as books and CDs. Some travel sites feature automated bargain finders that can find low air fares. At least one company, Priceline.com, reverses the buyer-seller relationship by having buyers bid the price they're willing to pay for a car or a plane ticket and offering that price to various sellers. It is unclear yet how broadly this approach will be used, but it is possible only through the Internet.\n\nOver time, software will automate price comparisons even more, until they become effortlessly electronic. At least one online store already checks other major sites for the prices of commonly purchased items and automatically reduces its prices to make sure that they're always slightly lower. Without stores to pay for, the seller may still make a profit. Customers will be able to join together electronically to get lower prices in ways that have not been easy before. There will even be cases in which software representing the seller negotiates with software representing hundreds or thousands of customers.\n\nFor the majority of products which are available through many stores, customers will benefit most. For unique products and services, sellers will find more possible customers and may charge higher prices. The more customers adopt the Web lifestyle, the closer the economy will move toward Adam Smith's perfect market in all areas of commerce.\n\nCustomers can now deal directly with manufacturers and service providers, so there is little value added in simply transferring goods or information. Various people have predicted \"the death of the middleman\". Certainly the value of some kinds of middleman is quickly falling to zero. Travel agents who simply book air fares will disappear. This kind of high-volume, low-value dealing is perfect for a self-service Internet travel site. In the future travel agents will need to do more than book tickets; they will need to create a total travel adventure. A travel agent who provides highly personalized tours of Italy or the California wine country will still be in great demand.\n\nIf you're a middleman, the Internet's promise of cheaper prices and faster service can end your role of assisting the contact between the producer and the customer. If this is happening to you, one option is to use the Internet to get back into the action. That's what Egghead, a major chain of software stores, did after struggling for several years. Egghead closed all of its physical stores in 1998 and began selling just on the Internet. Egghead now offers a number of new online programs that take advantage of the Internet, such as electronic sales for about fifty different categories of hardware and software, and for used computers. It's not yet clear whether Egghead will succeed and meet the test described in this chapter, which is that the middleman must add value, but the company certainly understands the principle.\n\nEvery store needs to take the Internet into account. The success of the Amazon.com bookstore, which exists only on the Internet, caused Barnes & Noble to combine its successful physical bookstores with a strong online presence, and to start working with Bertelsmann, a leading international media company.\n\nFor service industries, the Internet requires you to be either a high-volume, low-cost provider, or a provider of highly personalized services. For the high-volume, low-cost model, you use Internet technology to create a self-service approach. You make a lot of information available to customers and you drive a lot of traffic through your Internet site by offering the best price. Because only a few companies in any market will be the high-volume players, most companies will have to find ways to use the Internet not just to reduce costs, but also to deliver new services.\n\nE-Trade Securities started low-cost finance services on the Internet in 1992. By 1998 at least seventy companies bought and sold shares for their customers online, and the number was going up. Finance firms that still offer a service face-to-face or over the phone have a problem: most of the data about shares that these companies provide for their customers is available free on the Internet. But if the companies that do not offer an Internet service become electronic traders (e-traders), what can they do that is different to what customers are already offered?\n\nMerrill Lynch, the market-leading finance company, asked itself exactly that question when it looked at the way it did business in 1997. Customers have invested with Merrill Lynch for more than a century. The company has managed their shares by getting large amounts of financial data, analyzing it, and making long-term financial plans. By 1997 customers had more than one trillion dollars invested with Merrill Lynch. But the growth of low-cost trading and then Internet-based trading between 1992 and 1997 showed managers that the company would have to change. As Howard Sorgen of Merrill Lynch said, \"Our customers were changing. The way people got information and made decisions was changing. We would have been foolish to think we didn't have to change, too\".\n\nMerrill Lynch's main assets are its financial consultants, the people who advise clients about their investments. But in 1997 they were spending a lot of their time finding data and not enough time advising clients about their investments. The information systems at that time were expensive and hard to use. All the different categories of data-share prices, product information, the customer database, pricing - were on different systems, and all of them were incompatible and difficult to use. The new information system was built round the financial consultants. It helped them get data and develop the best financial plan for the client as quickly as possible. To save money and development time the company also wanted to use existing products when possible.\n\nMerrill Lynch managers asked their board for a billion dollars to invest in new technology. The board agreed that the best way to compete was to give the company's knowledge workers - the financial consultants-the best knowledge tools. So the managers got permission for what became a five year, $825 million project. This was completed on time in October 1998 for close to the $825 million estimate. Of that cost, about $250 million went on software development. Much of the remaining expense - a system for getting share prices and market news, for example - would have been required whatever software Merrill Lynch used. The actual difference in cost was about $250 million over four years. For slightly more than $60 million a year, approximately $3,500 per financial consultant, Merrill Lynch improved the information system for the 14,700 financial consultants in its 700 US offices and for another 2,000 consultants internationally.\n\nChief Technical Officer Howard Sorgen showed me the Merrill Lynch solution. All systems are now fully compatible. All financial information, from any source, is organized into \"pages\" and then \"books\". The financial consultant can look anywhere in these books - at share prices on NASDAQ, New York, and Tokyo, for example. The financial consultant can see immediately if all the client's shares are doing well or badly and why. Before, this took a lot of time as shares in each company were looked at individually. Now, the financial consultant can even see immediately what would happen if one lot of shares was bought and another sold. Soon clients will be able to see these calculations on their own PC screens. Also, the system behaves like a well-trained assistant to the financial controller. If the controller's client has shares in a company, the system will put background data about the company on the screen without being asked, whenever the controller asks for the share price.\n\nSince the changes in the system at Merrill Lynch, financial consultants have more time to build stronger relationships with clients. Merrill Lynch then decided that giving more information to clients would make the relationship with them stronger, not weaker.\n\nMerrill Lynch Online is a version of the Merrill Lynch system for customers. It gives the customer some background data on which decisions are based, and it also has basic information about the client's account with Merrill Lynch. The company hoped to get 200,000 customers in the first year, an average of about 550 people a day. Instead, 700 to 800 people a day went online with the system. One surprise was the age of the customers who took the system first. Merrill Lynch thought that the younger customers who had grown up with the Internet would try the system first, but the older, wealthier clients were the first customers.\n\nAfter the first success, Merrill Lynch added more to the online service. Today, customers can e-mail their financial consultants, look at the latest share prices, and buy and sell shares. Merrill Lynch now see the Internet as an opportunity, not a threat. It gives the client information, but financial information is not financial knowledge. That is still provided by the financial consultants, who now have more time to concentrate on it. And they provide it to well-informed clients, who ask better questions than badly-informed clients. The aim now is to have the client and the financial consultant looking at the same data on screen at the same time. Then, as Merrill Lynch people like to say, \"the real magic starts\".\n\nTouch your customers.\n\nAs electronic commerce grows, not only middlemen will find creative ways to use the Internet to strengthen their relationships with customers. The businesses that treat e-commerce as more than a way to easy money will do the best. Sales are the final goal, of course, but the sale itself is only one part of the online customer experience. Some companies will use the Internet to interact with their customers in ways that haven't been possible before. They will make the sale part of a series of customer services for which the Internet has unique strengths.\n\nIt's important that customers come away from electronic interactions pleased enough to tell their friends. This is the most powerful means by which any product or company builds a reputation, and the Internet is a medium made for easy communication. If a customer doesn't like a product or the way a trader has treated him, he's likely to e-mail all of his friends. An Internet car site called Autoweb.com asks customers about dealer service by e-mail, and removes dealers from its lists if they fail to improve their service as a result of complaints.\n\nToday, the main competition for online stores is physical stores. Physical stores have much higher sales volumes than online stores. Online sales in 1998 were only 0,5 percent of the total sales in the world's seven largest economies. But that percentage will grow enormously in the next decade. As e-commerce takes off, the main competition for Internet sites will no longer be physical stores but other online stores.\n\nRapidly growing categories for online commerce include finance and insurance, travel, and computer sales. Companies such as Cisco Systems, Dell Computer, and Microsoft are now doing billions of dollars each in business over the Internet every year. Chrysler expects its 1,5 percent online sales volume to jump to 25 percent in four years. Even the most cautious estimates project an annual growth rate of about 45 percent for online sales. The highest estimates were for more than $1,6 trillion in business by the year 2000. I think this is too low.\n\nDell was one of the first big companies to move into e-commerce. The company supplies computers worldwide, selling more than $18 billion worth of products. It began selling its products online in mid-1996. Its online business quickly rose from $1 million a week to $1 million a day. Soon it jumped to $3 million a day and then $5 million. It is still rising. Computer buyers clearly like and find it easy to buy their computers on the Web. At the time of writing, Dell has more than 1,5 million visits a week to its website, and 11 percent of its business is online. Dell hoped that this would grow to 50 percent, maybe as early as 2000.\n\nMichael Dell, who started the company, believes in direct selling and computer-aided commerce. But he knows that the Internet has to be a basic part of the overall business strategy. Dell's entire business is based on online commerce and support. Dell's first site provided product information, let customers buy online, and asked for customer ideas. Dell learned a lot from the suggestions that came in, mainly online. Over time Dell has made hundreds of changes to its website. Customers can do more and more online. They can now see online the progress of the product they have ordered.\n\n\"The Internet doesn't replace people. It makes them more efficient,\" says Michael Dell. \"We had to build an Internet system that was so convenient, customers got more value for their time than they did on the phone\".\n\nHaving more information online for customers didn't reduce the value of Dell's sales team. Like Merrill Lynch, Dell found out that an educated customer is a better customer. Dell's sales team became more like consultants to the customer. And they have more time for consulting because buying and selling online is so much quicker.\n\nOne of Dell's unique approaches to customer support was to create more than 5,000 individually designed pages for its big customers. About 65 percent of Dell's online business is from individuals and small businesses, and the Premier pages are one way that Dell is growing its corporate business. They make large purchases online easier and quicker.\n\nOnly Information Technology (IT) can balance the need to keep enough stock to supply customers quickly with the cost of keeping too much stock. Perfect information about what the customer needs is the answer to the need for zero stock waiting for an order.\n\nMarriott International, the world's largest hotel company, earns more than $10 billion from its 1,500 hotels around the world under ten different brands. The hotels have had an online booking system since 1996, and although Marriott says the system was simple and just an experiment, it did $1 million in business by the end of the year.\n\nMarriott saw that the Internet could do even more, and in early 1997 they created a special Internet team. From the start, the technology team worked closely with the business team. Studies showed that one of the subjects people wanted information about most was travel. \"The Internet is all about service,\" says Marriott's Mike Pusateri, \"providing service to customers in a way that is faster, friendlier, and more personal than they or the company has ever experienced before. And service is Marriott's business\".\n\nMarriott was one of the first companies to build an interactive home page on its website. You can search online for a Marriott hotel by asking for hotels in a certain city, for hotels with certain facilities, and for hotels that have certain features in their rooms. Linked pages show attractions close to the hotel, for example a golf course. Or, if you want to go to a Chinese restaurant, the system will list the six nearest. When you have chosen your hotel, you can find out about prices and book a room. There are also links to other sites that book rooms, like TravelWeb.com and Microsoft Expedia.com. Marriott's site has links to 1,000 other webpages.\n\nBecause each visitor searches for exactly what he or she wants on the Marriott website, each visitor has a different experience. The website is visited by 15,000 people a day, which brought in more than $2 million a month in money from Internet sources in 1997. It's hard for Marriott to know what percentage of this return would have come in anyway, by traditional methods, but it is clear that the Internet is attracting wealthier customers who prefer its more expensive hotels. On average, an online customer spends more with Marriott than the average customer.\n\nMarriott has found, as others have found, that the more interactive a site is, the more business activity it gets from its visitors. For example, instead of floor plans future customers see virtual pictures of the hotel. Soon customers will be able to enter the place they want to stay and the names of other Marriott hotels they have stayed in. The site will then give them the nearest Marriott hotel that is like the hotel they enjoyed before.\n\nMarriott does not cut out middlemen, it makes them part of its customer service. The company provides special places on its website for travel agents and meeting planners. Thousands of meeting planners view the Marriott site because they don't have to visit the hotel before they make a decision on where to have their meeting.\n\nAdopt the Web lifestyle.\n\nIf you asked your friends why they use the phone to communicate with their friends, or why they turn to the television for entertainment or breaking news, they'd look at you in a strange way. If you asked your friends whether they'd adopted \"the electricity lifestyle,\" they'd think you were crazy.\n\nPeople in developed countries don't think much about their electrical products, we just use them. But people who are now in their fifties can remember when just a few families had TVs. Our grandparents can remember when much of rural America was without electricity. It's taken more than a hundred years for the electricity lifestyle to revolutionize civilization.\n\nWhen streets and houses were first wired, the only use for electricity was for lighting. Electricity's capacity to change everyone's lifestyle was hidden. Electric light was cleaner, safer, brighter, and more convenient than natural gas, oil, or candles. When the infrastructure was in place, though, new products were created that took advantage of electricity. Electric refrigerators, record players, and air conditioners applied the new technology to existing needs. The most revolutionary uses of electricity were the phone, the radio, and the TV. These new machines changed our economies and our lifestyles. People hadn't dreamed of these products before the infrastructure was available.\n\nBecause the Internet is a communications infrastructure that depends on electricity, you could say that its popular acceptance is an extension of the electricity lifestyle. But the Internet is enabling a new way of life that I call \"the Web lifestyle\". The Web lifestyle, like the electricity lifestyle, will be characterized by new things happening quickly. The infrastructure for high-speed communications is producing new software and hardware that will change people's lives.\n\nIntelligent machines such as the PC are becoming more powerful and less expensive. Since they are programmable, they can be used for many different tasks. Within a decade most Americans and many other people around the world will be living the Web lifestyle. It will be natural for these people to turn to the Web to get news, to learn, to be entertained, and to communicate. It will be just as normal as picking up the phone to talk to somebody or to order something. The Web will be used to pay your bills, manage your finances, communicate with your doctor, and do any business. Just as naturally, you'll carry one or more small machines using a radio connection to stay constantly in touch and do electronic business wherever you are.\n\nFor a lot of people the Web lifestyle is very close today. By 1998 more than sixty million Americans were using the Web regularly, up from twenty-two million the year before. By 1998 the average user went on the Web eight to nine separate times a month, spending a total of about three and a half hours a month online. It's exciting to see that people living the Web lifestyle are using the Internet to learn and buy in new ways. When the Sojourner landed on Mars in the summer of 1997, NASA's website had forty-seven million hits in four days from people seeking more detail than they could get from the traditional news media.\n\nBusinesses are providing a wide variety of information and services, like real-time stock quotes, sports scores, and city guides. You can buy almost anything on the Web, from paintings to old toys. The Web is an ideal vehicle for helping to build a community, too. There are sites for tracking missing children, for helping people adopt pets, and for every pastime that you can imagine. Sites that involve citizens are getting excellent traffic flow.\n\nA cultural change as significant as a move to the Web lifestyle will depend on the age of users to some degree. The kids growing up with the new technology will show us the full possibilities. Personal computer use, high-speed networks, and online communication are widespread. Universities are getting rid of paper forms and registering students for classes over the Web. Students can look at their grades and even send in work over the Web. Teachers hold online discussion groups. Students e-mail friends and family as naturally as they call them on the phone.\n\nThe adoption of technology for the Web lifestyle is happening faster than the adoption of electricity, cars, TV, and radio. Many people who use PCs at the office install them at home for work, and then use them for much more. A lot of people over fifty-five years old, who wouldn't usually add new technology to their lifestyle, want to use the Internet as a way to stay in touch with their friends and families. Revolutionary new uses of the Internet that none of us can accurately predict today will change the world as completely in the twenty-first century as the unexpected uses of electricity did in the twentieth-and faster.\n\nAs people move rapidly online, one of the most basic changes will be the degree to which customers will manage their finances online. In 1998 only about one million of the fifteen billion total bills in the United States were paid electronically. Little online customer service was available. In fact, though customers can pay some bills online, in almost every case they still receive them on paper. When customers are able to pay online, the US Commerce Department estimates, processing costs will drop more than $20 billion annually. Today you have to calculate on paper what bills you want to pay and how much you want to pay on each. In the future, software will enable you to calculate online the effect of various payments on your bank balance. You'll make your payment exactly when it's due. And bill payment software will communicate with financial management software.\n\nBy late 1998 about half of all American homes had PCs, and about half of those PCs were connected to the Web. The percentages are lower in most other countries. Reducing the cost of high-speed communications so people can remain constantly connected, and making the software easier to use, are essential to making the Web lifestyle common. I believe that by the year 2001 more than 60 percent of US homes will have PCs and that 85 percent of those homes will be online. For other countries to reach these levels of use they will have to invest heavily in communications infrastructure.\n\nPeople don't realize how much the hardware and software will improve. Take just one example: screen technology. I do my electronic mail on a fifty-centimeter flat screen. It's not available at a reasonable price yet, but in two or three years it will be. In five years a hundred-centimeter flat screen will be affordable. Screen quality will have a big effect on how much people will read on the screen instead of on paper.\n\nThe cost of a personal computer is also coming down. Historically, the PC industry has concentrated on creating a more powerful PC at a particular price. Now advances are reducing prices as well. Capable PCs cost much less than $1,000 today, and lower prices are expanding the market. Looking at a ten-year time frame, you're going to have PCs that cost the same as a typical TV. In fact, the difference between a TV and a PC will be small because even the boxes that connect TVs to the cable system will have a processor more powerful than the one we have today in the most expensive PC.\n\nSmaller personal companions will become common. These will include the small PCs on the market today, and new PCs that are the size of a wallet, which will enable electronic operations. The phone, radio, and TV will pick up new capabilities as they go digital. Some machines will be carried with you. Some will be in different rooms in your house. Others will become standard in vehicles.\n\nAny of them will enable you to use e-mail and voice mail, get information from stock reports or other news, and find out the latest weather and news of your flight. These machines will connect through wires or through technologies that don't use wires, such as radio. Though the machines will operate independently, they will exchange data among themselves automatically.\n\nThese machines will become part of ordinary life. When you leave the office for the day, your personal digital companion will download your e-mail, which might include a grocery list from your husband or wife. At the store, you can download a new recipe, and all of the items for the meal will be added to your list. Your digital companion is smart enough to speak to all the machines that need to know your home or work schedule, but only tells the kitchen machines about the recipe. From a computer in the kitchen, you check the house. A video of the front door area shows who called when no one was home.\n\nDigital security cameras connected to a network are becoming cheaper and will be common to reduce theft. Some schools are providing cameras to enable parents to check on their kids while they're at school.\n\nWhile dinner is cooking, you go to a private website for your extended family, and find out that everyone has been in the chat room discussing what to do when the family meets. They used electronic voting to choose half a dozen possible events, and they've asked you to book as many of them as you can. A software agent, which knows you have already booked travel for the trip, suggests several things to do locally, including sailing, which was on your family's list. The agent also tells you about a new, lower air fare to your destination. You digitally book the sailing and the lower fares.\n\nWhen you're ready to watch TV, you might look at the electronic programming guide on screen or use another software agent to see what's on. You've told the agent your viewing tastes and it's tracked your actual viewing patterns, so it recommends several shows among the hundreds available on digital TV. You choose to see a football game. While watching, you use the interactive menu to enter a contest and to vote for the most valuable player. Viewer scores will count for half the final result. You watch a commercial advertising a car. Most viewers see a commercial for a truck, but data that you have volunteered through your TV indicates that you're a better candidate for a family vehicle.\n\nDevelopment of intelligent, interactive TV will come as television moves to digital technology. Digital broadcasts are easy to correct for errors, and allow high-quality video and sound. Digital TV can do a lot more than improve broadcast quality, though. Satellite and cable companies are already using digital TV to deliver more channels. Over time, the biggest effect of digital TV will come from the ability to include other digital data, providing interactivity, intelligent software, targeted advertising and sales offers, and the Web.\n\nBroadcasters will provide greater content such as links to relevant websites or entirely new Web content that adds to the broadcast, or music, or software that can be downloaded for a fee. Many of the new features require a two-way link, which is easy for the new cable TV systems. New technology will make the TV interface easier. Trying to record one or more programs at certain times and days remains annoyingly complex. In the future, taping a show will be as simple as telling the TV exactly what you want to tape. Using speech to interact with the TV, PC, or other personal companions will be common within ten years.\n\nBandwidth, the information-carrying capacity of a digital communications system, remains the biggest barrier to the widespread adoption of the Web lifestyle in all countries. Bandwidth is also the biggest cost. In developed nations businesses can generally afford the bandwidth they need to work digitally because lots of communications companies are wiring business districts. But it will take much longer to get affordable wiring into homes, schools, and libraries, which is critical to achieving a fully connected society. We will only see the benefits of a Web lifestyle when high-bandwidth systems are in place. The most important step for a country to achieve a high-bandwidth infrastructure is to encourage competition in the communications industry.\n\nScientists all over the world are exploring new communications technologies - and old ones. Recently a British engineer developed a way to send high-speed voice and data signals on ordinary electrical current, raising the possibility that Internet service could one day ride into your home over our existing infrastructure of electrical wires. This and other technologies such as satellite broadcasting are exciting because they don't require us to replace the existing wiring that already connects most homes in the developed world. It's a huge task to get the Web infrastructure in place all over the world, but the advances in many areas make it likely that the speed of improvement will surprise everyone in the next decade.\n\nThe social effects of the Web lifestyle will be enormous. A lot of people fear that computers and the Internet will make life less personal, creating a world that's less warm and friendly. Some people were afraid, at first, that the telephone would reduce face-to-face contact, too. Two people might call each other when they would have talked face-to-face without the phone, and two people might e-mail each other when they would have met face- to-face without e-mail.\n\nAny medium can be misused. The development of personal and professional manners for the Web will continue. It's easy enough to say that the Web lifestyle, with everyone in his or her little world, will cause society to fly apart. I believe the opposite is actually true. Just as the phone and e-mail have increased contact between people living in different communities, the PC and the Internet give us another way to communicate. They don't take any away.\n\nIn reality, the ability to use the Internet to move or change the boundaries of our communities is strengthening personal and cultural connections. The city of Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, has Internet discussions about issues like city planning, safety, and drugs. Citizens can connect to the police by e-mail. An Egyptian site for children called the Little Horus website contains more than 300 pages of information and pictures covering Egypt's 7,000 years of civilization. It also has information about Egypt today, including its economic, cultural, and social life. The \"Tour\" section includes tips on popular destinations for children.\n\nThe Web lifestyle is about broadening horizons, not narrowing them. Building communities is going to be one of the biggest growth areas in the next few years on the Web. The Web dramatically increases the number of communities you can join.\n\nIn the past you might have had time to be a part of your neighborhood community and one or two social organizations. In the Web lifestyle you are limited only by your interests.\n\nOne of the most powerful effects of the Web is the way it can connect groups of people independent of geography or time zones. If you want to get together a group of enthusiastic card players or talk about issues with people who share your political views, the Web makes it easy to do. If you want to follow what's happening in your hometown, the Web can help.\n\nHow are we going to find the time to live a Web lifestyle and join more communities? The Web will make things more efficient than they used to be. You can quickly find out how much your used car is worth, plan a trip, or find out anything you need to know when you want to make a major purchase. These things are easy on the Web today. And people will probably trade some of the time they now spend reading the paper or watching TV for the information or entertainment they'll find on the Web. A British study in 1998 showed that about 25 percent of the British adults who used the Internet watched less television than they did before.\n\nMuch of this book is about having all the information we want at the tips of our fingers. Most people want to find the best price for a product or to be up-to-date on the important issues affecting their local or national communities. We have managed without this information because obtaining it has simply been too difficult. The Web lifestyle isn't about changing human nature or the basics of how people live. Instead the Web lifestyle gives more people a chance to pursue their interests in a better way.\n\nThe Web lifestyle will change the way people shop. With the Web as the world's biggest collection of shopping malls, customers will have choices they didn't have before. They'll be able to find all the choices for goods they want and, in many cases, have them specially made. They can have the final product delivered directly to their doors. Because customers are demanding faster and more personal service, and stronger relationships, the Web lifestyle will drive companies to develop a digital nervous system in order to stay with their competitors.\n\nThe Web connects workers, friends, and families in new ways. Communities based on shared interests are forming with members from all over the world. Governments have the chance to involve citizens more than ever before. By enabling people to shop, get news, meet one another, be entertained, and gossip in ways we're only now beginning to understand, the Internet is becoming the town square for the village that the world will be tomorrow.\n\nWith a Web lifestyle, people can overcome many of the barriers that have existed for so long that we almost take them for granted. The Web lifestyle is not about adding complexity to already busy lives. As people become accustomed to the Web lifestyle, they'll eventually accept it unthinkingly, just as they do the electricity lifestyle they live today.\n\nChange the boundaries of business\n\nA flow of digital information changes the way people, organizations, and businesses work. Internet technologies will also change the boundaries of organizations of all sizes. In changing the boundaries, the \"Web workstyle\" of using digital tools and processes enables both organizations and individuals to change their roles. A corporation can use the Internet to work smoothly with professionals such as lawyers and accountants who remain \"outside\" the company walls. An important reengineering principle is that companies should concentrate on their basic skills and outsource everything else. The Internet allows a company to do this to a greater extent than ever before by changing which employees work within the walls and which work outside in a different role.\n\nOur basic skills at Microsoft are creating high-volume software products, working with other software companies, and providing customer service and support. We outsource a number of functions that don't fall into those categories, from help-desk technical support for our employees to the physical production of our software packages. The Web workstyle makes it possible to deal better with unpredictable demand. Because you have a great need for a skill, and then you don't, for some areas you want to be able to hire staff for a short time to deal with peaks and valleys. The Internet means that more companies can take a \"studio\" approach to running major parts of their businesses. Big Hollywood studios have full-time employees to handle finance, marketing, and other continuous projects, but the creative side of the business, the full-time movie-making staff, isn't very big at all. When a movie concept is agreed upon, a director brings together a large group of people to create the film. When they're finished, they move on to other projects.\n\nWeb technology makes it possible for many different kinds of projects to be structured as studio-type work. A project owner who wants to hire a team can go online, describe the project, and find out who's available. People and organizations with the right skills can declare their interest, and the project owner can build a team quickly. People looking for work will find more opportunities for employment that meets their particular interests and needs-if they have highly specialized skills, for example, or if they want to work only certain hours.\n\nDespite these changes, big firms won't break themselves down into project-by-project production companies. Big companies will continue to balance the load of their work as they always have - they'll just use technology to do it more efficiently. Every company will experiment to find its most efficient size and organizational structure, though the trend will be toward smaller companies. Medium-size and small companies can take advantage of the boundary-changing possibilities of the Web to act much bigger than they are, without adding employees or offices. A small company with the right skills can bid on and lead a movie production, a construction job, or an advertising project. By joining with other companies and professionals quickly, it can act as a virtual large company to work on the project until its profitable end. Because the team can be broken up at the end of the project, the company can manage labor resources without the administrative burden of a large full-time staff.\n\nSome employees in companies of any size are naturally nervous about the effects of the Web workstyle. They assume that if their company chooses to build itself around Web technologies, their jobs may disappear. They won't - unless \"restructuring\" is just a fancy term to hide sackings. When a company downsizes, jobs are lost. When a company outsources, jobs move. The goal is not to get rid of work, but to move the responsibility to specialists outside. It's much more efficient for many companies, including Microsoft, to have an outside company handle installation and support for small computers, for example, because companies that specialize in such work can develop world-best skills and because we can ask for competitive bids for the job.\n\nEmployees who react to the possibility of outsourcing with fear are assuming that work belongs \"in\" the company and not \"out\". As companies change, some people will have difficulties. Despite the understandable anxiety, employees should also look at the changes as opportunities to define their jobs the way they want them, and to work for an organization of the size and personality they prefer. They can even use this revolution as a chance to start their own business. Not long ago, one person who had been a writer watched Microsoft outsource writing work and recognized an opportunity. Today this person has a fine business managing a dozen or more writers, and Microsoft staff spend their time defining the work to be done instead of trying to manage the writing process for a bunch of different people. Overall the changes in organizational structure will be good for good employees.\n\nThe Web workstyle is particularly well-suited to lawyers, doctors, accountants, and engineers, who usually work independently or in small teams. One of the reasons professionals have traditionally organized themselves into firms is to deal with the rises and falls of customer demand. Now, instead of joining together to make sure the workload is shared, they'll also have the choice of working on their own and using the Internet to find customers.\n\nNot everyone will choose this approach. A lot of people want to work for bigger firms. They like the idea of belonging to one company, working on long-term projects, and being part of the community and culture of a particular workplace. They invest in their career, and the company invests in them. A lot of the most interesting jobs, such as software design at my company, are central areas that won't be outsourced. Most companies, including Microsoft, work hard to make it attractive for good employees to stay long-term. Developers join Microsoft because they see the chance to design software or develop technologies that will be used by millions of people. Like many artists, they want their work to reach the largest possible audience.\n\nPeople who want to work for a big company will work for one, and people who don't want to will have interesting alternatives. A Web workstyle also makes it easier for people who have good skills but who can't, or choose not to, work full time. Because they can find more work over the Internet, and do more work from home, those people will have new opportunities. Society will benefit by making better use of this huge pool of talent.\n\nAs a business manager, you need to take a hard look at your basic skills. Look again at the areas of your company that aren't directly involved in that work, and consider whether Web technologies can enable you to outsource those tasks. Let another company take over the management responsibilities for that work and use modern communications technology to work closely with the people - now partners instead of employees-doing the work. Also, consider the employees who have good skills and experience, but decide they don't want to work full time. Better communication tools may allow you to continue using these people. The competition to hire the best people will increase in the years ahead. Companies that give extra freedom to their employees will have the advantage in this key area.\n\nGet to market first\n\nCustomers want high-quality products at low prices, and they want them now. Every business, whether it's a producer of products and services or a supplier to that producer, has to react quickly while keeping quality high and price low. Information technology has become a major contributor to the faster responses, the higher quality, and the lower price rises that have defined business in the last decade.\n\nFew industries illustrate the two main pressures of shrinking time and improving quality better than the car industry. Japanese car designs in the 1980s appeared fresher and their quality improvements more frequent than in American cars because Japanese car makers could take a car from concept to mass production in three years. American car makers typically took four to six years, and their costs were higher.\n\nAmerican companies responded by breaking down the organizational barriers that had divided design, manufacturing, and sales divisions from one another. They also improved communications with their external partners. Designers, engineers, suppliers, and manufacturing personnel began to work in tight teams that communicated electronically, cutting the time from product design to salesroom floor by half.\n\nOther process improvements in the car industry have been significantly helped by technology, including the computer-aided design (CAD) of cars. The 3-D modeling capacities of CAD programs enable engineers to design a vehicle without having to build a model by hand first. The designers can see whether parts will fit together and can change part designs without building special tools. Electronic links between car manufacturers and suppliers have already reduced the error rate in parts delivered by 72 percent, and saved up to eight hours per week per car in labor costs.\n\nCustomers have benefited from better cars, produced more quickly. Ford's achievements in production are representative of the entire car industry. In 1990 the company took five or more years to take a car from concept to customer, and it experienced 150 faults for every 100 cars, or 1,5 faults per car. By 1998 Ford had cut its cycle time by more than half, to less than twenty-four months. Its fault rate had gone down from 150 to 81 faults per 100 cars.\n\nIn some industries the issue is getting to market fast when change is more and more complex. Intel, for example, has always had a ninety-day production cycle for its chips, which power most PCs. Intel expects to maintain this ninety-day production rate, although the processor is getting more and more complex. The number of transistors in the chip increased from 29,000 in the 8086 chip to 7,5 million in the Pentium in 1998, and what the processor is capable of grew by 10,000 in the same twenty years. By 2011 Intel expects to deliver chips that have one billion transistors. Moore's law says that the power of the chips doubles every eighteen to twenty-four months. If cars and cereal went the same way, then by Moore's law a car would cost twenty-seven dollars and a box of cereal would cost a penny.\n\nIntel uses a variety of management, production, and digital methods to maintain efficiency while putting more and more transistors onto a chip the size of a thumbnail. Each time the production process changes, new factories are built that cost more than a billion dollars each.\n\nIn 1998 Intel introduced a \"copy exactly\" strategy to maintain the same level of efficiency and quality across all its chip factories. A program called D2000 made sure that every design engineer got the benefit of best practice across the organization. Intel discovered that more than 60 percent of the problems the designers faced had already been solved by another design team. It's very likely that any large company using manual processes would find a similar amount of repeated work. D2000 has helped Intel to almost double the speed of new product production since 1994, and it has helped Intel toward its goal of volume production from the first design of a chip, without having to go through several versions of a design to get it right.\n\nAlthough banks have always been big users of information technology, they have not had a reputation for fast time to market with new products or services, except for Banco Bradesco, the largest bank in Brazil. With nearly 2,200 branches and twenty million customers, Banco Bradesco has $68,7 billion in assets and serves three million people a day. It was the first Brazilian bank to use computers in 1962, and it was the first bank to offer automated cash machines, in 1982. Banco Bradesco uses technology to stay ahead of the competition. Even six months is too long to bring an idea to the market; the usual development cycle is weeks or, at most, a few months. The bank also aims to bring a new product or service to its entire customer base at the same time.\n\nFor one small-business customer, Bradesco developed software to assist with money going into and out of the business. Now about 4,100 businesses are using this program. For another customer, Bradesco developed a salary card that employees could use in a Bradesco cash machine, even if they did not have an account with the bank. The card is now in use at about 1,300 companies and will soon be in use at 2,000 companies with one million employees. In each case, Bradesco was the first bank to offer the service.\n\nIn 1996, Banco Bradesco became the first bank in Brazil, and only the fifth in the world, to use the Internet to offer banking services. By 1998 the number of online customers was growing at 12 percent per month. Online banking is more popular in Brazil than in any other country. The bank's website, BradescoNet, offers a full range of financial services. By being the first important commercial Internet site in Brazil, the bank has the opportunity to become the site that Brazilians go through to get to other sites. What better way to keep customers loyal to your company?\n\nBut the bank recognizes that it needs to use its digital nervous system even better in the future. The bank wants to collect more information about each customer so that it can sell new financial products targeted at the right people. For example, if a program finds a customer paying car insurance, the bank could offer a loan to buy a new car, even if the customer financed his present car at another bank. Customer data is one of the bank's best assets. It will take Bradesco several years to put together all the information they have, but when they do they can offer many more financial services targeted at the right people.\n\nTime to market has got faster in the PC industry than anywhere else. In this situation a better flow of digital information does not just improve the company, it is essential for the company's success.\n\nIn just a few years the product cycle for Compaq computers dropped from eighteen months to twelve months. By late 1998 it dropped to six to nine months for business products and to four months for consumer products. But with its older information systems, Compaq needed forty-five days to collect its worldwide sales information and reduce it to the single set of numbers needed for product planning. By the time it could communicate its manufacturing needs to its suppliers, the company would be halfway through the four-month product lifecycle for important products.\n\nCompaq started an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. All its factories now use the same software, so all the data that goes into ERP is compatible. The forty-five day planning cycle has now come down to a week. Although a week's sales are necessary to see long-term sales trends, in the future it will have data on sales per day.\n\nCompaq is also using real-time systems which help it to react to unplanned changes in demand. Using the same data that goes into ERP, Compaq wants to look at its supply and order position three times a night, eight hours apart in the United States, Europe, and Asia. With real-time data instead of data that is a week or even a day old, Compaq wants to be able to see and react to, for example, an unplanned order for 7,000 PCs, and work with suppliers to see immediately if the company can deliver the order in time.\n\nTo be able to move as quickly as possible as a company, Compaq has moved all its data systems onto the Internet. An e-commerce system means that when an order comes in, the supplier sees this at the same time as the Compaq planner. But all this has to be done while production is still going on. John White, Chief Information Officer of Compaq in 1998, said it was like changing the wings and engine of a jet while it was still flying.\n\nAnother software decision is: do you get all the ERP software from one company or do you get the best from a lot of different companies? Because compatibility is so important, most companies are going to a single company for all their ERP needs. But Microsoft is interested in making ERP work either across versions or with one set of software. Compaq's solutions are a good example of how technology and business depend on each other, and help each other.\n\nDigital processes make it possible for every company to dramatically shorten its time to market, although some amount of time and energy will always be required to deliver physical goods. MIT's Nicholas Negroponte describes the difference between physical products and information products in the digital age as the difference between moving atoms around (physical products such as cars and computers) and moving bits around (electronic products such as financial analyses and news broadcasts). Producers of bits can use the Internet to reduce their delivery times to almost zero. Producers of atoms still can't do this, but they can use bit-speed-digital organization of all kinds-to bring reaction time down dramatically. Almost all the time involved in producing an item is in the organization of the work, not in the actual production.\n\nGood information systems can remove most of that waiting time. And makers of physical products will find that online service will become as much a part of their \"product\" and customer experience as the physical goods they deliver. The speed of delivery and the interaction with the customer made possible by the Internet effectively shifts products into services. Product companies today need to compare themselves not with the best of their competitors, but with the best of all service companies.\n\nIn the end, the most important speed issue for companies is cultural. It's changing what everybody assumes about how rapidly they must move. Everybody must realize that if you don't satisfy customer demand quickly enough, without lowering quality, a competitor will. When people accept the need for action, digital technology enables a fast response.\n\nChapter three.\n\nManage Knowledge to Improve.\n\nStrategic Thought.\n\nBad news must travel fast.\n\nI have a natural ability to find bad news. If it's out there, I want to know about it. The people who work for me have realized this and keep me informed.\n\nA lot goes wrong in any organization, even a good one. A product fails. You're surprised by a customer who suddenly switches to another company. A competitor brings out a product that appeals to a broad new market. Losing market share is the kind of bad news that every organization can understand. Other bad news may be about what's going on inside the company. Maybe a product is going to be late, or it's not going to do what you expected it to do, or you haven't been able to hire enough of the right kinds of people to carry out your plans. An essential quality of a good manager is the desire to seek bad news rather than deny it. An effective manager wants to hear about what's going wrong before he or she hears about what's going right. You can't react appropriately to disappointing news if it doesn't reach you soon enough.\n\nYou concentrate on bad news in order to get started on the solution quickly. As soon as you're aware of a problem, everybody in your organization must go into action. You can judge a company by how quickly it organizes all of its brain-power to deal with a serious problem. An important measure of a company's digital nervous system is how quickly people in the company find out about bad news and respond to it. Digital technology speeds business response time in any emergency.\n\nIn the old days, every company's response to bad news was slow. Business leaders often learned about problems only after they became serious, since the only quick way to pass information was to interrupt them with a phone call. Before handling a problem, people had to find information in paper files or go down the hall to find somebody who knew something about the situation. When people had some information, they spoke on the phone or sent papers to one another. Every step in the process took a lot of time. Today the dawn of the Information Age means we can send information fast, but even now most companies don't gather the key information about customer issues in one place. By contrast, a well-designed digital nervous system operates as an early-warning system.\n\nThe Internet was not always Microsoft's top priority. Its arrival changed our business and became the biggest surprise we've ever had to respond to. In fact, in 1995 various experts said that the Internet would put Microsoft out of business. This was bad news on a huge scale. We used our digital nervous system to respond to that crisis.\n\nOn August 24, 1995, we introduced Windows 95, the most ambitious software product ever to reach the general customer. This was big news, and hundreds of stories appeared in the months before the release. Windows magazine said, \"This year- for better or worse - Microsoft wins the war\". A Time magazine story said that Microsoft was \"the center of the computer universe\". The introduction of Windows 95 itself was featured on major TV news broadcasts. Within a couple of months, though, the news stories were all taking the opposite view. The Internet had burst into the public's consciousness, and people believed that Microsoft hadn't been invited to the new party. Now stories in the press said we didn't understand the Internet. Smaller, quicker competitors would put Microsoft out of business.\n\nOn December 7, 1995, we held our first Internet Day, where for the first time we publicly displayed the range of technologies we were developing to build Internet support into our products. Within a year of this we had \"Internet-enabled\" our major products and delivered a number of new ones that concentrated on the Internet. Now we lead in several major Internet areas. No one company will dominate the Internet, but Microsoft has come back to play an important role.\n\nHow, our customers and the press often ask me, did we turn the ship around so fast? First, we were never so unaware of the Internet as we might have seemed to outside observers. It wasn't as if somebody said \"Internet\" and we didn't know how to spell it. We had several Internet technologies on our list of things to do. But let's also be clear. In 1993 we were not concentrating on the Internet. It was a fifth or sixth priority. At this time, we didn't have an overall Internet plan for the company. We didn't see that the Internet, a network for scientists and engineers, would grow into the worldwide commercial network it is today. The Internet, had such a limited capacity to carry digital information then that we saw it as a minor stop along the way. The Internet's sudden growth in popularity changed all the rules. People knew the Internet had faults, but it made vast amounts of information available and enabled easy communication. In 1993 alone Internet use doubled to more than twenty-five million people.\n\nThe driving force behind Microsoft's response to the Internet didn't come from me or other senior executives. It came from a small number of enthusiastic employees who saw what was happening. Through our electronic systems they were able to get everybody to join them. Their story is an example of our practice, from day one, that smart people anywhere in the company should have the power to change things. It's an obvious way for Information Age companies to work: all knowledge workers should be part of creating the plan. But we couldn't make it work without the technology we use. For years everybody at Microsoft has had a PC with e-mail. It's a famous part of our company culture, and it's shaped the way we think and act.\n\nWe reached most of the important decisions during this crisis in face-to-face talk. But our decisions were all informed by exchanges taking place over e-mail. Working together electronically cannot replace face-to-face meetings. It's a way to make sure that more work gets done before meetings so that the meetings in person will be more useful. Meeting time is so valuable that you want to be sure you're dealing with facts and good ideas based on solid analysis. You want to be sure that meetings produce plans, that you don't just sit around talking philosophy. E-mail helps turn managers from middlemen into \"doers\". It encourages people to speak up. It encourages managers to listen. That's why, when customers ask what's the first thing they can do to get more value out of their information systems, I always answer, \"e-mail\".\n\nHow fast a company can respond in an emergency is a good measure of how well it responds to events. People in the organization will feel threatened by bad news, but that's OK if they feel it as a group. As a leader, I created a sense of crisis about the Internet in 1994 and 1995. Not to leave people unhappy or unable to work, but to excite them to action. The leader needs to create an environment in which people can analyze the situation and develop a good response.\n\nI like good news as much as the next person, but it also makes me suspicious. I wonder what bad news I'm not hearing. When somebody sends me an e-mail about an account we've won, I always think, \"There are a lot of accounts nobody has sent mail about. Does that mean we've lost all of those\"?\n\nThis reaction may seem unnecessary, but I've found there's a psychological need in people to send good news when bad news is coming. It's as if they want to lessen the shock. A good e-mail system makes sure that bad news can travel fast, but your people have to be willing to send you the news. You must always be open to bad news, and then you have to act on it. Sometimes I think my most important job as a boss is to listen for bad news. If you don't act on it, your people will eventually stop bringing bad news to your attention. And that's the beginning of the end.\n\nIn three years every product my company makes will be out of date. The only question is whether we will replace them or someone else will. In the next ten years, if Microsoft remains a leader, we'll have to cope with at least three major crises. That's why we've always got to do better. I insist that we keep up with events, as well as pursue longer-term projects, and that we use \"bad news\" to drive us to put new features into our products. One day, somebody will catch us asleep. One day, a new firm will put Microsoft out of business. I just hope it's fifty years from now, not two or five.\n\nChange bad news to good.\n\nIf you treat unpleasant news not as a negative, but as evidence of a need for change, you aren't defeated by it. You're learning from it. Learning from failures and constantly improving products is a key to success in all companies. Listening to customers is a big part of that effort. You have to study what customers say about their problems with your products and be constantly aware of what they want.\n\nBut it is surprisingly hard to get bad news from customers passed all the way to the product design groups. Most companies don't have an efficient chain of people and paper between customers and the people who can make major improvements. When the customer data finally reaches the product design group, it often isn't easy for the team to give it the right priority. All of the delays mean that improvements don't happen as fast as they should.\n\nI recommend the following approach to bringing customer complaints and wish lists into the process of product and service development:\n\n1. Concentrate on your most unhappy customers.\n\n2. Use technology to gather rich information on their unhappy experiences with your product and to find out what they want you to put into the product.\n\n3. Use technology to pass the news to the right people in a hurry.\n\nIf you do these three things, you'll turn those bad news experiences into an exciting process of improving your product or service. Unhappy customers are always a concern. They're also your greatest opportunity. Listening and learning rather than being defensive can make customer complaints your best source of significant quality improvements. Adopting the right technology will give you the power to capture and change complaints into better products and services fast.\n\nFor example, any employee of Promus Hotels, based in Memphis, Tennessee, can give customers their money back if they are not satisfied. A no-questions-asked money-back guarantee from a service company like Promus means something. The company has a good reason to fix the problem right away. And because every employee can act on the guarantee, employees watch for quality. So how does Promus stop customers using the guarantee for a free stay and complaining when nothing was really wrong? Technology. All complaints are dealt with by the same main computer. It can quickly identify anyone who goes from hotel to hotel claiming poor service and getting money back. Promus then sends a nice letter, regretting that the hotels could not meet the customer's standards and inviting him to stay in a competitor's hotels.\n\nIf your customers can contact you electronically with their problems, you need to be prepared to answer quickly. When a customer mails a letter to a company, he or she doesn't expect a reply for a week, but the customer knows that the e-mail arrives in a few minutes, if not seconds. It's usual for businesses to respond to e-mail within a few hours or overnight. A few days is \"slow\". If you take weeks to reply, customers will take their business elsewhere. Because e-mail is so much easier to send than paper mail, you're likely to get many more responses, too. So when you ask for electronic responses, make sure you have the staff and the internal systems in place to handle them quickly.\n\nListen to your customers and take their bad news as an opportunity to turn your failures into the improvements they want. Companies that invest early in digital nervous systems to capture, analyze, and build on customer opinion will stand out from the competition. You should examine customer complaints more often than company finances. And your digital systems should help you change bad news into improved products and services.\n\nKnow your numbers.\n\nJiffy Lube was the world's number one servicer of cars, but it was unprofitable when the Pennzoil Company bought it in 1991. By 1997 Jiffy Lube earned $25 million, the highest earnings in its history and an increase of 14 percent over 1996 earnings. Jiffy Lube serviced 21 million cars, an increase of 1,2 million over 1996. Driving this new success was a daily flow of information from each store to headquarters and back. Customer service information from all 1,600 Jiffy Lube outlets is sent to headquarters at Houston every night. Headquarters does immediate analysis on the figures. Beginning as early as 5 AM, up-to-date data is available to each Jiffy Lube outlet. For example, if people in one neighborhood are not using their Jiffy Lube outlet as much as expected the manager of that outlet will know about it.\n\n\"Know your numbers\" is a basic business principle. You need to gather your business' data at every step of the way and in every interaction with your customers - and with your partners, too. Then you need to understand what the data means. The numbers shouldn't be your only concern but you should objectively understand everything possible about your business. If you're considering exchanging short-term profits for long-term gains, for example, you need to know as closely as possible the cost of that trade. Companies can use the data they collect to improve the efficiency of their businesses, strengthen their relationships with both customers and partners, extend their businesses in new ways, and develop better service and new products.\n\nThere are two ways to use customer data. The first is to gather the numbers that show trends and patterns on which to base analysis, planning, and decisions. The second is to collect detailed information on the individual customer so that you can provide personal service. By creating a digital flow of information from start to finish, businesses are able to create tight links between knowledge management, commerce, and business operations. At Microsoft we showed big improvements as soon as we started using MOET (Microsoft Order Entry Tool) to take customer orders, and MOET is now an advanced website for electronic commerce worldwide.\n\nTo use information well, you need to capture it digitally from the start and analyze it in digital form at every stage of your business processes. \"Every stage\" includes not just what happens within your company walls, but also what happens with both your customers and your suppliers. Knowing your numbers can produce big changes in all of your business relationships and give you a significant competitive advantage.\n\nThe business side of any company starts and ends with deep analysis of its numbers. Whatever else you do, if you don't understand what's happening in your business factually, and you're making decisions based on soft data or emotion, you'll eventually pay a big price. Numbers give you the factual basis for the directions in which you take your products. They tell you objectively what customers like and don't like. They help you identify your highest priorities so that you can take fast action. Nothing else can take the place of understanding your numbers at a working level. Sometimes my friend Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's president, surprises the members of a product group by knowing their pricing structures and sales numbers - and the competitors' - better than the people presenting a plan to him. He has a way of marching into a room and immediately asking the one question the team doesn't have an answer to. He's done the work, and he's thought hard about the issues that come out of the numbers. He sets a high priority on decisions that are based on facts.\n\nThe middle managers at a company are the people who should be analyzing the numbers. Other groups can help, but the people who deal with customers and competitive problems need to look at their business in every way possible every day. The analysis should support action and not just more analysis. Analysis should lead you step by step to a decision and to action. You have to think, act, judge, adapt.\n\nStarting with digital numbers doesn't just prevent unnecessary effort and errors. It also sets in motion the best ways to process the data afterward. Being digital from the start drives efficiency in manufacturing, shipping, billing, and other operational processes. Getting the data digitally is also the only way to make sure that you get information quickly enough to respond to customer needs before your competitor does.\n\nThis need for good information to drive employees to quick action is one reason that \"paper numbers\" bother me as much as paper forms do. A printed sales figure or a printed number on customer trends is fixed. You don't have the ability to get in and analyze the detail behind the number, or to e-mail it to somebody to talk about it. With a paper number that looks wrong, you have to get hold of somebody and say, \"I'm looking at this report, and this number surprises me\". A lot of the time there's an easy explanation: a customer has put in a big order or has canceled one. There's nothing you need to do, but you still want to know quickly why the month's results look strange. If you notice a trend in a paper report, it's hard to send the paper around and get people to analyze it. Over time you stop paying attention because it's so hard to investigate. When figures are in digital form, knowledge workers can study them, attach notes to them, look at them in any amount of detail or in any view they want, and pass them around to get help. A number in digital form is the start of thought and action.\n\nDigital technology also enables a company to create a network of partners that serves its customers better. You can create a virtual company in which everyone is joined together by commerce, knowledge management, and operational systems. Your partners are better connected to you, benefit more from your success, and naturally respond to the same patterns of customer behavior that you do.\n\nWhen your information systems are designed to create a flow of information to and from your customers, the business processes of the entire supply system will become more efficient. Just-in-time delivery can be a reality for any industry.\n\nDigital information flow makes it possible to create an organization without limits, but it takes a new company culture to turn suppliers from \"them\" into \"us\". Traditionally companies have not thought of suppliers as a true part of the overall business process needed to serve customers. Today's approach is that of a \"value network,\" a network of partners enabled by digital information flow. Everyone who touches the product must add value, and communications go forward as well as back. Companies in the value network aren't restricted by heavy chains of process, but can interact and do business with many different sellers as they need to.\n\nIf the benefits of knowing your numbers and creating a value network are so persuasive, why don't more companies do it? Why don't more companies create a digital information flow to observe trends? Why don't they follow customer history? The main reason is that too few companies start with digital information. Existing paper systems cause people to assume that data is hard to get and work with. They have to work with piles of papers that they can't organize or analyze. They can't find patterns in their data. They can't turn their paper information into action. Because so few companies are using digital tools internally or with partners today, those firms that act quickly to create a digital nervous system have the opportunity to jump ahead of their competitors.\n\nTo make the change to a more efficient virtual company, you need to look first at all of the paper on the desks of knowledge workers and ask: How could digital systems get rid of these piles of papers? As part of this inquiry, think of your business processes as extending far beyond your walls to include the entire network of your partners and customers. You need to develop business processes supported by a fast, reliable flow of information that will enable the customer to drive your responses and the responses of all your sellers as if you were a single unit.\n\nMove people into thinking work.\n\nThe inevitable result of better computer systems is a smarter use of people's time. With intelligent software continuously searching through its sales data, following trends, and noticing what's selling and what's not, the British chain store Marks & Spencer can use its 500 to 600 buyers much more efficiently.\n\nInstead of working through fat paper reports from the previous day to try to find out whether sales are going well, the buyers can use their time more efficiently, using what the latest data is telling them. If sales are going well, no human action is needed, but the system checks sales data and notices any items whose sales are higher or lower than expected. Reports on these items are created automatically and they are all that buyers must deal with.\n\nUsing software to handle routine data tasks gives you the opportunity to provide the human touch where it really matters. There's a dramatic difference between getting a note that was clearly written by a person rather than a computer. It's enormously valuable to have a person working with any customer who is unhappy about something really important, or who has special needs. In a hotel, for instance, smart software can dramatically shorten the check-in and check-out time. Staff can then help customers rather than filling in forms, and guests will enjoy their stays more as a result.\n\nElectronic commerce, though, brings new challenges. In a physical store a sales person can use clues such as the customer's questions, dress style, and body language to assess his or her interests. However, at a Web store no one sees the customer, and the goal is to let the customer do as much shopping as possible for himself or herself. Web store owners then have some interesting information to find out. Based on customer behavior, how do you construct a model of who the shopper is? It requires smart data analysis.\n\nDigital tools for analysis are changing the nature of work. Knowledge workers can concentrate on unusual events rather than on the routine. Of course, people don't like allowing machines to take their decisions for them. But when a database gets big enough and complex enough, the computer can do the initial searching and sorting far better than a human being. We're simply not able to recognize patterns in large amounts of data. And the available data - in databases, file systems, message systems, and websites - is growing all the time. The only way we can get the full value of all this data is to use computer tools to find the useful information.\n\nHarperCollins, the publishing company, uses a PC-based system to follow book sales so that it can print just enough books to meet demand. That way it won't be caught with large stocks of unsold books in stores, which publishers have to take back. After only a year in operation the new system has helped HarperCollins reduce returns of unsold copies of its most popular books from over 30 percent to about 10 percent. Each percentage point represents millions of dollars in savings.\n\nUsing software to find useful patterns in large amounts of data is called data mining. It can help to predict whether customers are likely to buy an item because of their age, sex, hometown, and other characteristics. It can also identify customers with similar shopping behavior, and customers with specific tastes, in order to provide improved individual service. An Australian health-care company used data mining to follow buying patterns and discovered a $10 million fraud.\n\nThe most common use of data mining is for database marketing, in which companies analyze data to discover customer tastes and then make offers to specific sets of people. For example, American Airlines uses information about the twenty-six million members of its frequent flier program - such as the car rental companies, hotels, and restaurants they use - to develop targeted marketing efforts that have saved more than $100 million in costs.\n\nData mining is part of customer relationship management (CRM), in which information technology helps companies manage customer relationships individually instead of all together. With the patterns revealed by data mining, you can present your products to a customer in a way that's most likely to increase your value to the customer, and his or her value to you. Cost savings come from having more exact models of customers and so the amount of mailings is reduced. A direct marketing campaign for something like credit cards, for example, would normally get a return of about 2 percent. Mellon Bank USA in 1997 had a target of 200,000 new customers, which would normally mean a mailing to 10 million people. Instead, the bank used data mining to produce models of the most likely new customers. The bank was then able to meet its target of 200,000 new customers with a mailing of 2 million, not 10 million. In addition to reducing costs, each new customer was three times more profitable than usual because data mining had targeted the customers whose needs best matched Mellon Bank's services.\n\nThis personalization will deeply affect all forms of advertising. As digital TV becomes more popular and electronic books become the preferred way to read magazines and newspapers, almost all advertising will move away from mass advertising to personalized advertising. The commercials that appear on screen will differ according to who is looking at them; different neighborhoods or even different homes in the same area could see different commercials. Big companies can become more efficient with their advertising, and small companies can consider TV and magazine advertisements for the first time. Today many types of advertisement are too expensive for any except true mass-market products. Soon even the neighborhood grocer might be able to afford commercials for people living near the store.\n\nTargeted advertisements should make customers happy. They're more likely to see advertisements that are relevant to them. Some people may be worried that advertisers have too much information about them, but software will make it possible for people to reveal only the information they want to reveal. For example, most people wouldn't mind if advertisers were given viewing patterns. Most regular readers of specialized magazines - whether the topic is sports, food, science, gardening, or cars - look at the advertisements as carefully as the articles. If you watch TV in the same way, mainly for one or two interests, you probably wouldn't object to seeing commercials that concentrate on those interests.\n\nToday most data mining systems are quite expensive, ranging from $25,000 to $150,000 for a small or medium-size business to millions of dollars for a big customer like Wal-Mart. One insurance company spent $10 million for a data mining system five years ago. The boss said he knew he could get the same results for a lot less money with today's technology, but the benefits had been worth the investment.\n\nThat remark indicates the value of data mining, but these high prices reflect the old days of complex software, in which only the largest organizations, using a lot of staff or hiring specialists, could make good use of data. With the growth of competition in our information-based economy, customer data has become an increasingly important asset. Every company and everyknowledge worker must try to get the most out of the company's data assets. These new users can't afford big database budgets or specialized database experts.\n\nFortunately, as data mining systems become available for PCs, you'll see prices drop dramatically and the use of data mining explode in companies and departments of all sizes. Soon every company will be able to do the kind of analysis that used to be reserved for the richest organizations.\n\nThe greatest value of data mining will be to help companies decide the right products to build and the right way to price them. Companies will be able to look at a variety of packaging options and prices to see which are most attractive to customers and profitable to themselves. These possibilities are of special interest to companies that sell information products. Unlike a car or a chair, products such as insurance, financial services, and books cost much more to develop than to produce and have a value fixed more by the customer than by the physical cost of goods. The secret of success with information products is understanding the characteristics and buying habits of your most likely customers.\n\nThe power of data mining will help companies to work out how to acquire new customers, whom to market to, how to price their products, and how to attract individual customers. Human creativity and skill are needed to use this information to create new packaging and pricing ideas, to see new products in the patterns of the computer results, and to develop exciting new offers. The better the tool, the more creative they can be.\n\nManagers need to invest in advanced tools that help people work. You should budget 3 to 4 percent of the salary of your knowledge workers to make sure they have the best tools, which free people to use their energy for creative responses to the patterns and trends identified by the computer. Using information to develop new products and services, and to work together more closely with partners and customers, will always remain a uniquely human task.\n\nRaise your corporate IQ.\n\nLike reengineering before it, \"knowledge management\" has been given so many meanings that it sometimes seems to mean whatever someone wants it to mean. News articles on the topic appear regularly. Consulting companies and websites specialize in knowledge management, and a \"knowledge management\" magazine started in 1998. If reporters talk to a database company, they find that knowledge management is the newest thing in databases. If reporters talk to a network company, they find that knowledge management means the future of networking. But as a general concept - to gather and organize information, pass the information on to the people who need it, and constantly improve the information through analysis and teamwork - knowledge management is useful.\n\nSo let's be clear on a couple of things first. Knowledge management, as I use the phrase here, is not a software product or a software category. Knowledge management doesn't even start with technology. It starts with business goals and processes and an understanding of the need to share information. Knowledge management is nothing more than managing information flow, getting the right information to the people who need it so that they can act on it quickly. And knowledge management is a means, not an end.\n\nThe aim is to increase corporate IQ. In today's fast-moving markets, a company needs high corporate IQ to succeed. By corporate IQ I don't just mean having a lot of smart people at your company - though it helps to start with smart people.\n\nCorporate IQ is a measure of how easily your company can share information broadly and of how well people within your organization can build on each other's ideas. Corporate IQ involves sharing both history and current knowledge. The workers in a company with a high corporate IQ work together efficiently so that all of the key people on a project are well-informed and full of energy. The final goal is to have a team develop the best ideas from throughout an organization, and then act with the same purpose and concentration that a single, enthusiastic person would bring to a situation. Digital information flow can help groups to function like individuals.\n\nA company's high-level executives need to believe in knowledge sharing, or even a major effort in sharing will fail. Leaders must also show that they themselves are not locked away in a palace, isolated from everyone else, but are willing to engage with employees. Jacques (Jac) Nasser, operations president at Ford, sends an e-mail every Friday afternoon to 89,000 Ford employees all around the world, sharing the week's news - the good and the bad - with everybody. No one checks the e-mail. He talks straight to the employees. He also reads the hundreds of responses he gets each month and assigns a member of his team to reply to any that need an answer.\n\nI don't send out weekly reports, but I do e-mail employees around the world on major topics. Like Jac Nasser, I read all the e-mail that employees send me, and I pass items on to people for action. I find the e-mail that people send me an amazingly good way to stay aware of the attitudes and issues affecting the many people who work at Microsoft.\n\nWhen business leaders have created an atmosphere that encourages teamwork and knowledge sharing, they need to set up specific knowledge-sharing projects across the organization and make knowledge sharing a key part of the work itself - not an extra that can safely be ignored. Then leaders need to make sure that the people who share knowledge are rewarded. The old saying \"Knowledge is power\" sometimes makes people keep knowledge to themselves. They believe that this makes them more valuable to the company. Power comes not from knowledge kept, but from knowledge shared. A company's values and reward system should reflect that idea.\n\nKnowledge management can help any business in four major areas: planning, customer service, training, and teamwork on projects. If you haven't done any work on knowledge management in your company yet, consider picking one or two areas in which to begin knowledge management projects. You can use the success of your projects in those areas to encourage knowledge management projects in your other business areas. Within a few years all leading companies will have achieved high levels of digitally aided knowledge sharing.\n\nKnowledge sharing can help brand planning across countries. Coca-Cola set up worldwide communication with its own e-mail system in the 1980s but it saw IT as an expense to be controlled rather than a tool to help better business. When this changed, all systems and functions were made compatible worldwide and the biggest user of technology was marketing, not finance. The marketing tool Inform (Information for Marketing) looks at data about consumer preferences in every country. From sales data, it can tell you what types of people in a small town in South Africa drink Sprite every day and how much they drank last March.\n\nKnowledge management can be used to make response to customers faster. Yamanouchi Pharmaceuticals, at $3,9 billion, is the third largest drugs company in Japan. They and Microsoft have made Web-based information systems an important part of improving quality and speed of answers to customers' technical questions. Product support at Yamanouchi can immediately answer about half the questions that come in from doctors. To find answers to more difficult questions they use Yamanouchi's Web-based PRoduct INformation CEnter Supporting System or PRINCESS. This uses electronic searches by product and by word. Answers are put into the system for use next time. In 1998, PRINCESS was made available to the sales team. The next step could be to make it available to doctors themselves.\n\nOnline training is another area where knowledge management can make things faster and better. US Web trains people to use technology in business. It has developed SiteCast for interactive seminars. Online training has been really popular at Microsoft. In 1998 twice as many people were training online as in class.\n\nDigital information flow can help in product development, too. Nabisco has some of the most popular foods in the world. About a third of its new products are worldwide successes, a third do OK, and another third underperform. These results are better than average, but with competition increasing Nabisco decided to use information technology more in the product development process. Nabisco didn't need a new product development process. The technology was needed to help the product development team communicate with each other better and faster. A system called Journey now organizes the information that used to be anywhere on any desk in the office. All of the people involved in the development of any new product need only to click on the product to find all the information about it. For example, Nabisco developed a new product and something in the product was changed. The people writing the description of the product on the label saw the change online and changed the label immediately.\n\nKnowledge management is a fancy term for a simple idea. You're managing data, documents, and people's efforts. Your aim should be to improve the way people work together, share ideas, sometimes argue, and build on one another's ideas-and then act together for a common purpose. The boss's role in raising a company's corporate IQ is to create an atmosphere that promotes knowledge sharing and teamwork, to make a priority of those areas in which knowledge sharing is most valuable, to provide the digital tools that make knowledge sharing possible, and to reward people for contributing to a full flow of information.\n\nBig wins require big risks.\n\nTo be a market leader, you have to have big goals. You can't just look at the past or the current state of the market. You also have to look at where it's likely to go, and where it might go under certain circumstances, and then direct your company according to your best predictions. To win big, sometimes you have to take big risks. Big bets mean big failures as well as successes. Today, looking back, it's easy to believe that Microsoft's current success was inevitable. But at the time we made our big bets - including starting the company as the first personal computer software firm - most people thought we would fail.\n\nMany leading companies hesitated to move to new technologies for fear of ruining the success of their existing technologies. They learned a hard lesson. If you don't take risks early, you'll decline in the market later. If you bet big, though, only a few of these risks have to succeed to provide for your future. Microsoft's current goals include improving the PC's performance beyond all existing systems, developing computers that \"see, listen, and learn,\" and creating software to power the new personal companion computers. These plans are Microsoft's response to the future, in which all machines will use digital technology and need to work with one another. Whether or not these plans succeed, one fact is clear: we have to take these risks in order to have a long-term future.\n\nRisk taking is natural in a new industry. The computer industry is about as far into its development as cars were in the 1910s and planes were in the 1930s. Those industries went through revolutionary, and often messy, technical and business change before they became stable, and the same thing is happening in the computer industry.\n\nDevelop processes that give people power.\n\nA business has processes that are similar to the basic biological processes that keep us alive. One of these processes is the function that defines the company's reason for existing - its manufacturing process, for example. This function has to be as efficient and reliable as the beating of a heart.\n\nA second kind of automatic process in business is administrative - the process of receiving payments, paying bills and salaries, for example. The administrative processes are as essential to a business as breathing. If the basic operational processes of your business fail, your company fails.\n\nBecause the basic operational processes are so important - and so expensive - most big companies began to invest heavily in automating them years ago. But too often the automated processes were isolated from one another. Overall efficiency wasn't nearly as good as it could be. Until recently, for example, in the manufacture of some aircraft parts only 10 percent of the original metal was actually used in an aircraft. The manufacturing process had been improved at many individual stages along the way rather than as a whole. There was an enormous amount of waste.\n\nI have talked about business operations such as financial and other administrative systems in other sections. In this section I concentrate on production processes. An automated production process is necessary, but not enough on its own to make a company competitive today. A good digital nervous system can help you develop your employees into knowledge workers, changing your company's basic production processes into a competitive advantage.\n\nFirst, you need to use information technology to understand the inner workings of the process itself better in order to make it both more efficient and more responsive to changing circumstances. Entergy Corporation of New Orleans has increased the efficiency of its power plants with a new process-control system. This allows plant operators to adjust plant efficiency and analyze performance trends as they occur. Operators can actually look inside the plant systems in order to understand exactly how the machines are functioning and to work out whether a minor change or a repair might save an expensive repair later.\n\nAn intelligent PC-based system makes sure that the highest-priority items are repaired first. The process-control system actually shows operators the cost of reduced efficiency if the temperature is ten degrees lower than it should be, for example. By attaching a dollar figure to operational decisions, Entergy is turning its operators into business people, giving them the information they need to run their units efficiently, and making them a lot more responsible for their decisions. And because production costs for Entergy's plants are available to senior staff electronically on a minute-by-minute basis, the company can improve its profits by moving power production constantly to those units that are delivering the most cost-efficient energy.\n\nThen you need to be able to get data from your production process to inform other business systems. The Stepan Company, which produces cleaning chemicals, has developed a process-control system that has raised the plant's output by 300 percent and saved the company millions of dollars through more efficient use of its equipment. But the efficiency gains are not as valuable to Stepan as the way that its process-control system can deal with changing customer demands.\n\nFinally, and most important, you need to feed the data from your production process to your production workers so that they can improve the quality of the product itself. If you provide the right technology to help production workers do fast analysis, they'll turn data into information that will help you improve design and reduce faults. Developing a digital nervous system allows you to give more power to as many of your workers as possible.\n\nIn the new organization the worker is no longer a part of a machine but is an intelligent part of the overall process. Some metal workers now have to know mathematics to work out angles from computerized designs. Water-treatment companies train production-line workers how to do computerized measurement and math. New digital copiers require the service personnel to have an understanding of computers and the Internet, not just skill with a screwdriver.\n\nHuman beings remain essential in operational processes that have to constantly improve and adapt to changing circumstances. An efficient production line needs people-well-informed, responsible people. As we organize tasks into processes, we give workers more responsibility. Computers will take over some jobs, but they will mean that many other jobs are no longer boring.\n\nWhen people can concentrate on whole processes, their work is more interesting and challenging. Simple tasks will disappear, or be automated or built into a bigger process. Work that involves repeating the same task over and over again is exactly what computers and other machines are best at - and what human workers are poorly suited to and almost always hate. Managing a process instead of performing a task makes someone a knowledge worker, and good digital information flow enables knowledge workers to play their unique roles.\n\nMost companies have been willing to give information tools to their high-paid office staff whose job is information work. Entergy and Stepan are proving that building systems around information flow and giving information tools to line workers can also provide enormous value. Entergy is changing all of its key business processes and pushing information and decision-making down to the operational level. Stepan is using information to manage its plants as a whole to adapt to changing customer needs. Both of these companies are applying knowledge management to business operations to analyze and improve production, quality, and failure rates. Digital tools bring more intelligence to their business operations.\n\nGive your workers better jobs with better tools, and you'll discover that your employees will become more responsible and bring more intelligence to their work. In the digital age you need to make knowledge workers out of every employee that you can.\n\nChapter four.\n\nSpecial Projects.\n\nNo health-care system is an island.\n\nA few years ago, a new Microsoft employee was called back to his home state because his mother had suffered a mild stroke. When she was well enough to leave the hospital, Mrs Jones (not her real name) stayed with her sister while her son completed plans to move her near him. Mrs Jones largely recovered but was never able to live on her own again, and her periods of good health were interrupted by hospital stays to treat more and more serious problems.\n\nThe medical events of the last two years of Mrs Jones's life show the best and the worst of the American health-care system. She received good care, including a number of very new treatments, from three different hospitals and more than a dozen doctors in two different states. As her physical abilities declined, her middle-class family was able to find good facilities providing greater degrees of care. Medicare and her own private insurance paid most of the bills; she and her family paid the rest. Her many doctors, nurses, and other care givers were professional and kind.\n\nBut the system was far from perfect. When Mrs Jones left the first hospital for her sister's hometown fifty kilometers away, a communication failure between doctors meant that her medicine was kept at full strength when Mrs Jones should have been on a declining dose. By the time she arrived in the North West, side effects of the high dose meant that she had to go into hospital immediately. Because her records didn't come with her, a number of expensive tests had to be repeated.\n\nThe same thing happened when she changed hospitals a year later. Her final three-week hospital stay, which did not involve any surgery, still cost $25,000. At one point, a doctor confused her with another patient and told her next doctor that her recent hospital stays were \"an abuse of the system\". This was less than a week before Mrs Jones died.\n\nThese and other problems went on even though Mrs Jones had her family to help her work through the confusing medical and social services options. Her son and daughter-in-law took turns spending many hours standing in line at one agency or on the phone with another. And it took a year before they could persuade one hospital to stop billing them for services that had been paid for in full.\n\nBecause of the many hospitals, doctors, care facilities, and public and private agencies involved, the amount of paperwork was enormous. Consider the number of people this paperwork represented. For every doctor and nurse who treated Mrs Jones, there must have been a dozen billing people in several different organizations. It was like an old-fashioned military operation. For every soldier in the field, you had twenty people behind the lines handling administration.\n\nMost experts estimate that 20 to 30 percent of the annual trillion-dollar cost of the US health-care system is spent on paperwork. In hospitals that number could be as high as 40 to 40 percent. A single week's stay can create as many as a hundred pieces of paper. And, making things worse, about 13 percent of the one to two billion claims each year in the United States are returned for errors.\n\nPaperwork and complexity have risen even as the US health-care industry has shifted to \"managed care\" in an effort to reduce costs, prevent fraud, and provide appropriate care. With managed care, an organization will contract with a group of doctors to provide medical services toward managed results, and for fixed fees. More than 160 million people in the United States were in managed-care plans at the beginning of 1997, the last year for which figures are available.\n\nDoctors understand the need to control costs but feel buried in rules and layers of management. They're afraid that their medical options may be limited and that the care of patients may suffer. They have also made the situation more complicated by treating patient files as business records and often hesitating to share them with competing doctors. And they've largely been opposed to computers, although that's mainly because early medical systems were clumsy and expensive. Oddly, the managed care that many doctors love to hate may become the primary force that extends information systems into patient care and returns control of patient care to doctors. When you put enough clinically helpful information in front of doctors, they see the benefits and ask for more.\n\nPatients, meanwhile, are recognizing how much more information is available to them on the Web and how this information gives them a sense of control and responsibility in maintaining their own health.\n\nClinical benefits have also encouraged health-care bosses to push for better information systems. Until now, health care has applied only 2 to 3 percent of its earnings to information technology, compared with the banking industry's 15 percent. Although health care is a high-technology field, the technology has been applied to individual treatment systems, not to information flow. Often the information software that is used is not designed to work with other information software, despite all the health-care areas that should share data: the laboratory, the blood bank, charting, billing systems, and the machines that watch over patients.\n\nOrganizations have had to build special interfaces between the different software programs. A typical health-care organization can have hundreds of these interfaces. One organization currently manages 1,800 different interfaces. This complexity is one reason it has typically taken two years for a health-care organization to buy a new system and another two years to install it - too slow by any standard.\n\nToday the situation is more encouraging. The US government has passed laws that require a standard to be defined for electronic finance and administrative dealings, including computer-based patient records. Better information handling in medical organizations will be a requirement in the future. Some health organizations, recognizing that their patients' needs can't wait, are showing strong leadership. They're proving that a digital nervous system can be enormously valuable in all areas of patient care: from emergency services through hospital treatment, keeping in touch with patients, and long-term trend analysis.\n\nImagine you had a health-care system in your local community built from digital parts. An intelligent emergency system gets you to the hospital quickly, and all the important information on your medical history and current medical condition feeds immediately into the hospital's computers. A doctor uses a touch screen, keyboard, or pen to order your treatment. Digital instructions are sent off to the laboratories. Computers supply laboratory results electronically. These and other reports are online for easy review by any doctor, on site or off. The system will tell doctors about any possible problems with the treatment or differences from the approved clinical path. Billing is handled automatically. Systems that process computer deals uncover fraud or unusual use.\n\nInstead of spending half their time on paperwork, doctors and nurses spend almost all their time treating you and their other patients. Test results and bills reach you in simple, understandable language. All the information about your treatment and medicine is assessed automatically over the longer term to help prevent problems.\n\nYour care after hospital is also scheduled automatically. You find medical information on the Internet and so your meetings with health workers are more informed, whether you communicate with them over the Internet, by e-mail, or you meet in person. You use e-mail to ask routine questions of your doctor and to be reminded about continuing health programs.\n\nWhen you change health plans, all your medical history goes with you instead of being lost or following after you several months later. Doctors use your history to identify trends in blood pressure, weight, and other patterns that might reveal a serious developing problem. Systematic medical analysis of the whole community makes the authorities aware of any worrying public health trends much sooner and more accurately than has been possible before.\n\nIf health-care communities take an approach based on PC and Web technologies, abilities like these do not have to cost a fortune. PCs enable a step-by-step approach using standardized software. PCs are also now being used to control specialized machines such as blood and tissue analyzers, reducing their costs and enabling their data to be shared.\n\nPCs are powerful enough to handle hundreds of thousands of claims or inquiries per hour. All together, the technologies described in this chapter would cost less than $5 million for a typical health-care organization. This is not a small amount of money, but it is minor compared with the amount most health organizations spend on paper-based work and stand-alone computer systems today. With paperwork making up 20 to 30 percent of the $1 trillion-plus per year earnings of the US health-care system, the current cost is $200 billion to $300 billion annually - more than the entire earnings of many countries.\n\nToday the lack of information systems in doctors' offices is the biggest barrier to improving patient care. Only about 5 percent of offices in the United States use computer systems in their clinical work. Computerizing a doctor's office will cost from $10,000 to $50,000 for each one, but doctors can quickly recover the costs. A five-doctor office in Hammond, Louisiana, invested about $50,000 in PC patient systems that made it easy for doctors to enter data; the office saved $60,000 the first year in typing costs alone.\n\nIt will take a big effort from health-care providers to improve health care through digital information. The technology is available today. An investment in a shared infrastructure and tools will enable not just a huge reduction in costs, but better health treatment for everyone. Change will be driven by two groups: patients who insist on being better informed and more involved in their own health, and health professionals who use these new tools to provide better care. Together they'll use a digital nervous system to turn the islands of health care into a single continent.\n\nTake government to the people.\n\nGovernment, maybe more than any other organization, can benefit from the efficiency and improved service that flow from digital processes. Developed nations will lead the way in creating paperless processes to reduce administration. Developing nations will be able to provide new services without ever having to deal with clumsy paper methods.\n\nBut most governments are far behind business in using the tools of the digital age. Businesses going digital are stuck with many paper forms because governments are not yet online. The reason for this delay is a lack of organizational purpose. Because government processes use a lot of paper and people, in the past making them more \"efficient\" often meant a reduction in service. It's common for governments to forbid agencies to close any offices, which simply forces them to struggle to do more with less.\n\nAt the same time, there are few pressures to provide better service. Citizens can't take their business to another tax agency or vehicle-license office. Government agencies tend to concentrate on their own internal organizational needs rather than the broad needs of citizens and businesses. As an example, consider the paperwork involved in hiring a child-care provider in the United States. The employer has to know that there are five agencies involved, each with its own set of forms. This complication, rather than a desire to avoid paying the taxes, explains why so few people follow the rules. In this and many other cases, to the average citizen government remains a threatening knot of separate agencies and rules.\n\nBut digital processes and the Web lifestyle give government the opportunity to change so that it is organized around citizens rather than administration. Governments can take five major steps to help make the digital age a reality in their countries. The first two involve improving government services; the last three involve creating an infrastructure so that a country's businesses can compete in the digital age:\n\n1 Put government employees on e-mail and get rid of paper filing. Make sure that all information inside government is digital.\n\n2 Put government services online with an interface designed for the user. Publish everything on the Internet.\n\n3 Attract investment by technology companies and encourage electronic commerce, sometimes with financial help, but more often with joint projects. Create a standard for the electronic identification of businesses and citizens.\n\n4 Remove the rules that stop the communications industry from working efficiently. Encourage major investments in the communications infrastructure.\n\n5 Improve the skills of citizens by using technology as part of education and training systems at all levels.\n\nGovernment, like businesses, can make better use of software tools and e-mail to get far more benefits from technology investments. In developed nations many government employees and public officials already have PCs on their desks, and developing nations can put in a PC infrastructure for a small cost. The use of e-mail alone promotes cooperation between agencies and enables public officials to respond better to inquiries. Some US politicians are beginning to use e-mail to stay in touch with citizens, and Australia's national parliament is using digital work flow to make sure that inquiries are followed up.\n\nGovernments need to make the decision to use digital information flow instead of paper. Internet publishing should be standard. Printed documents should be rare. The savings would be immense. The US government alone spends one billion dollars annually printing documents that are already available on the Web. Most copies of these documents are for public officials whose offices are already online. Most of the printed copies end up in the trash in the nation's capital. Web publishing of all government documents can reduce costs and make information far easier to find. Digital systems are also better for complex documents. The government description of a transport plane, which companies need if they want to bid to build it, weighs more than a house in printed form, but the data would easily fit on a couple of CDs.\n\nAn online approach does more than simply reduce paper expenses. Web technology makes it possible for governments to provide a single point of contact for the public, a single online \"face\" to structure information according to what is important to the citizen.\n\nIn several Swedish cities, for example, webpages organize a variety of services from various levels of government. Citizens can quickly find passport offices, tax authorities, and national insurance offices. They can get reports from public meetings and other public documents. They can even get real-time reports on public transport, based on electronic information from the vehicles, either using the Internet or kiosks. A kiosk is just a PC designed for public use.\n\nAs the Internet provides the best way to interact with government, all citizens need to use it, even if they don't have PCs themselves. If electronic kiosks that work like bank cash machines are placed in post offices, libraries, schools, and other public buildings, they can help governments improve services while reducing the cost of delivery.\n\nOnline systems are most useful for citizens and most efficient for government when they have more than one purpose. Governments should review all their dealings with citizens that require them to stand in line or fill out forms. Government should bring together all the agencies involved to develop a single system for handling all contact with citizens.\n\nThe Irish government, using An Post, the Irish postal service, has done this best. An Post kiosks process bill payments, issue passports, issue licenses for vehicles, pay benefits, offer savings and investment plans-even sell stamps. Each kiosk is a tiny city hall, covering the work of half a dozen agencies. With many of the 1,000 An Post sites in small towns with fewer than 2,000 residents, the kiosks serve 1,26 million people each week-half the Irish population - and handle more than $9 billion each year. Changing or adding new operations is very easy.\n\nFor government dealings like these, as well as for all commercial deals, security is essential. Security has two elements: protection of personal data while it's moving over the network and identifying the person carrying out the operation. Today there is encryption technology that is strong enough to protect the security of any electronic movement on a network, but US export controls on encryption technology restrict US firms from building it into their products. Since this does not keep encryption technology out of the hands of criminals, the software industry is working to change the US government's mind on this issue. In practice, the encryption that can be used is strong enough that in most cases the security of data in a network is not the weak link. Electronic data is as safe as data in other forms.\n\nIdentifying the user is equally important. You don't want someone else getting into your government records or your bank account. Smart cards are a solution to identity problems, as with the cards for bank cash machines. In Spain a new kiosk system will let anyone find out general information about social benefits by going through a touch-screen menu, but the person needs a smart card to find any personal information.\n\nThough such cards are just like the bank cards used around the world, some people are worried that the government might collect too much information about citizens. Some nations have privacy laws that prevent a single card or database from containing all information about a citizen, so in some nations there will be two cards: one for financial operations with business or government and another for health care.\n\nWidely available information and the ability to put a lot of information on smart cards will cause societies to look again at the question of how information can be used. Should any employer be able to see a job candidate's police record? Or just organizations such as schools, which hire people who work closely with children? In the end these are political questions rather than technological issues. Each country will have to decide on the kinds of personal information that will be allowed on smart cards. Even if their use is restricted to identity only, the efficiency gains and the prevention of fraud are worth the investment. In London, 200 trial kiosks of a system like An Post's reduced benefit payment fraud by 750,000 pounds in the first year. When installed at all 1,500 post offices, the kiosks are expected to save 150 pounds million per year.\n\nLess developed countries may assume that a digital approach to government is out of reach, but countries without systems can start fresh with new technology, which will be less expensive than manual approaches. Developed countries have older systems that often must be joined together.\n\nExamples from around the world make it clear that many of the advances are happening in smaller governments - smaller nations and cities, counties and provinces, and the state levels of larger nations. Smaller governments are less complex and they can experiment and work out solutions on a smaller scale. For larger governments, the lesson is to start with smaller projects to develop the necessary skills and see how citizens respond. Concentrate at first on projects that directly touch citizens and particularly ones that get rid of organizational complications for the public.\n\nKing County in my home state of Washington is probably ahead of many governments in the amount of information it publishes online, but the county does not yet package information or operations simply. To get a building permit in rural King County, you must obtain information from many sources: the phone book, phone calls to the county office, two or three printed documents, and the department's website. A single well-structured website, with all the information and links involving all steps in the building permit process, would remove most of the complications, and could automate some of the steps.\n\nSavings from new digital systems would represent a significant portion of every government's budget. The US military recently found that it was spending more money to process and approve travel permits, $2,3 billion, than it was spending on travel itself, $2 billion. The US government budget is $27 billion for food stamps, $25 billion for social benefits, and $13 billion for public housing. These programs all have enormously expensive paper-based administrative systems that eat up 30 percent of the money. Good digital systems could push this below 10 percent.\n\nCitizens are becoming more aware of the power of the Web and they are no longer willing to accept the idea that government service should be slow or confusing. No customer would stand in line for two hours to get service from a private business. Why should a worker stand in line for two hours at a government office and lose two hours of pay, when by using the Internet he could get his license or pay his fees and be at work on time?\n\nGovernment alone, by building key services around the Internet, will provide a big reason for citizens to move to a Web lifestyle. If the government, usually the largest \"business\" in any country, is a leader in the use of technology, it will automatically lift the country's technical skills and drive the move to an information market. Building an information economy will make all the companies in the country more competitive. The Information Age benefits from having more people involved. As more and more countries join in, the importance increases for all countries. World trade will be done digitally.\n\nNo government can put a fully digital approach in place immediately, but every government can begin now with strong first steps that benefit citizens and make them feel that the government is working for them. The main principle should be that citizens should never again have to fill out lots of forms or go to lots of places to get information.\n\nAs one government official said in conversation about his new website, which lets people download a hundred years of county records online, \"People can tell when you're trying to help. They know the difference between a government agency trying to help them and one that's just getting in the way\".\n\nCreate connected learning communities.\n\nPCs can give more power to teachers and students than any other group of knowledge workers. Students are pure \"knowledge workers,\" since learning is all about acquiring knowledge. Teachers will be able to use the Internet to share with each other and to allow students to explore a subject in new ways. With a solid infrastructure in place, some schools are already benefiting from PCs in the classroom. Many schools struggle to find the resources for these new tools, but clever programs have shown that there are rewards for the effort.\n\nThe success of PCs as educational tools requires teacher involvement. Without teacher training and making PCs central to the teaching program, they will not have a big effect. Many PCs have gone into computer \"laboratories\" where they sit, seldom used. Schools need to shift from treating the PC as a subject - teaching about technology -to including it in all areas of the teaching program: teaching with technology. More and more schools are now showing that PCs used as learning tools can have a strong influence.\n\nIn the Western Heights Independent School District, just west of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, teachers were enthusiastic when the district provided training the summer before it introduced PCs. More than 200 of its 230 teachers signed up. Most teachers have a great love of learning and they'll get excited about anything that will help kids learn. What teachers don't want is to be thrown into something they have not had the opportunity to learn about and become comfortable with.\n\nWestern Heights is a small, seven-school district with a moderate industrial tax base. The student population contains a mix of cultures. About 65 percent of the kids qualify for free or reduced-cost school lunches because they come from homes with lower incomes. This is not the school district that you might expect to lead the advance into the Information Age. But in the past three years the district has voted three times to spend a total of more than $6,8 million in local funds to create maybe the leading technology - based teaching program in the country. The community sees the investment as the only way to break the cycle of poverty that could trap these children if they go unprepared into the digital world.\n\nA PC can be a powerful new teaching tool for teachers. They find they can make kids more interested in lessons by including photos, films, and links to Internet pages. One teacher at Western Heights starts his class each day with fresh news from the Internet. PCs are part of each teacher's life in class at Western Heights. Teachers also use e-mail to communicate with one another about common issues. They don't have to wait for the district meetings that occur a couple of times a year. They can reach out to fellow teachers with questions and get answers back quickly.\n\n\"People may not realize how alone teachers are in the classroom,\" Joe Kitchens of the Schools Department at Western Heights says. \"Most teachers remain behind closed doors all day. They have little time for sharing experiences or interacting with other teachers. There are only a few times a year when they can gather together. E-mail stops them being isolated\". Kitchens also jokes that teachers are able to complain to him more than before. They expect him to answer their questions immediately over e-mail.\n\nAn important way to take advantage of investing in technology is to use the school infrastructure to benefit the entire community. Basic computer skills are one type of education that can be applied in any job. In most countries, one out of every ten information technology (IT) jobs is not filled. The United States and Europe each need more than half a million new trained IT professionals in the next several years. Rapidly developing areas such as India and Latin America may have greater shortages.\n\nHighdown School in Reading, England, is paying for the infrastructure it needs through a mix of private and public money. Highdown School expects the community to contribute. Adults can get online technical training either at the Reading schools, which open on evenings and weekends for that purpose, or at home. Fees for this service go toward maintaining and expanding the IT system.\n\nMost knowledge workers in the United States have their own PC, but even at the best of schools there are usually more than seven students for every PC. It's expensive for schools to buy PCs for every student, especially when PCs become out-of-date every three years or so. For this reason there's a fear that the gap between the \"haves\" - those families that can afford PCs at home-and the \"have-nots\"-those that cannot afford PCs at home - will create a major gap in opportunities. Creative approaches in providing PCs to every student are beginning to help solve this problem.\n\nOne project started in the early 1990s in Melbourne, Australia, where Bruce Dixon, a teacher interested in technology, saw significant differences in teaching results when he could use half a dozen computers for his classes instead of just one. He realized that, for the best results, students had to use PCs as a tool for all their work - in all their classes and at home as well as at school.\n\nOut of many meetings came the idea of having all the students finance their own machines. Dixon, by then a technology advisor, worked out a financial plan. For a monthly fee, students get a machine and software. The seller provides service, and when the student graduates the family keeps the machine. It's still difficult for all families to afford the fees. Families that are wealthier can afford the typical forty-dollar monthly fee over a three-year period. Many families can afford to pay a small amount. Business and community organizations can make up the difference. Whatever the amount, the family contribution is basic to this program, as it gives the students and their parents a sense of owning and being responsible for the computer and for its role in the students' education.\n\nPrograms like this have spread to schools all over the world. The effects have been impressive. A recent report shows that students who regularly use computers gain many skills. They write more often and better; they have better analysis skills; they express themselves more creatively; they work more independently, and they are better at problem solving and critical thinking.\n\nOne of the most forward-looking ideas is to use PCs to offer a variety of ways to learn. About fifty different major theories attempt to describe individual learning styles. Most of the theories identify similar qualities. In the simplest terms, some people learn better by reading, some by listening, some by watching someone else do a task, some by doing the task. Most of us learn by a mix of all of these methods. And all people have different levels of ability and different personalities and life experiences that affect how well they learn. New software is helping students learn, whatever their learning style or ability. Software can present information in many different forms that can be adapted to the individual student much more easily than paper methods.\n\nPCs can help change the learning experience from the traditional approach - a teacher talking at the front of a classroom, with reading tasks - to a more hands-on approach that takes advantage of the natural curiosity of students of all ages. PCs enable students to explore information at their own speed, to learn from sound and pictures as well as from text, to do experiments, and to work together with other students.\n\nPCs are the primary tools for working and communicating in the digital age. The PC and the Internet change one thing completely: they provide every student in every school and community with information and ways of working that, before now, were not available even to students at the best schools. Educators will take advantage of that to help their communities. PCs are a new teaching and learning tool, and educators who use them will be the agents of change.\n\nChapter five.\n\nExpect the Unexpected.\n\nPrepare for the digital future.\n\nCustomers are the main people who benefit from the increased efficiency of information technology, and the benefits will increase as the economy becomes more digital. The other people who benefit are business people who take advantage of digital methods faster than their competitors. The solutions I have talked about in this book are the result of the vision and leadership of business people who used IT to serve their customers better.\n\nBusiness leaders who succeed will take advantage of a new way of doing business, a way based on the increasing speed of information. The new way is not to apply technology for its own sake, but to use it to change how companies act. To get the full benefit of technology, business leaders will make their processes and their organizations simpler and more modern. The goal is to make business responses nearly immediate, and to make strategic thought a process that goes on all the time - not something that's done every twelve to eighteen months, separate from the daily flow of business.\n\nNew technology should provide better information to every worker who might possibly use it. Knowledge workers are the brains of the company. If they're disconnected from the company's important data, how can they work, how can they take responsibility? You can give people tasks and authority, but without information they can't do anything. Knowledge is the best power tool. If important information about production systems, product problems, customer crises and opportunities, lost sales, and other important business news gets through the organization in minutes instead of days, and if the right people can be working on the issues within hours instead of days, a business obtains a huge advantage. This change in the structure of processes is more important than any other change since mass production.\n\nEvery company can choose whether to lead or follow the digital trends. The Internet is changing the basis of industries in real time. Winning is not easy. Digital information flow and giving power to employees is part of achieving and maintaining competitive advantage. A belief in giving people power is the key to getting the most out of a digital nervous system. Knowledge workers and business managers benefit from more and better information, not just senior management. When employees get a couple of good tools that deliver better results, they demand more. It's a positive cycle.\n\nHowever you organize your company, one thing is clear: it is impossible to manage a company totally from the center. It is impossible for a single person or group of people to stay on top of every issue in every area of a business. Leaders need to provide planning and direction and to give employees tools that enable them to gather information and understanding from around the world. Companies that try to direct every action from the center will simply not be able to move fast enough to cope with the speed of the new economy.\n\nIn business the argument between central authority and the individual is the difference between the old-style way of thinking, which saw workers as lazy people who needed to be controlled, and the theory that workers are creative and should be given responsibility. Digital processes support the idea that workers can - and will - do more if allowed, enabled, and encouraged to think and act.\n\nThis argument about the center and the individual is not just academic. The choice affects the design of companies and systems. The design of the first manned space ship shocked the original pilots years ago. There were no manual flight controls. Don't worry, said the scientists. The system would fly the ship. The pilots, like the monkeys before them, were just there for the ride. The pilots resisted. They all had experience of \"advanced\" systems that failed when things got difficult. The pilots won, and on several flights the pilots' skill brought them home safely when the central, programmed system failed. The issue is not whether computers can fly better than pilots. Today planes and space ships use large amounts of computer technology to extend the human ability to fly. The issue is whether someone \"at the center,\" away from the real circumstances, can possibly predict all of the things that can change or go wrong - whether in space or in a business office.\n\nMany parts of business can be improved through digital systems, but it will take a number of years to improve every single part. Every bit of data in a company should be in digital form, and easy to find, including every file, every record, every piece of e-mail, every webpage. Every internal process should be digital and connected to every other process. Every operation with partners and customers should be digital. You should allow partners and customers to have all the data that is appropriate to them, and they should do the same for you.\n\nHuman beings are not the biggest animals, the strongest or fastest, or the sharpest in sight or smell. We survived and grew successful because of our brains. We learned how to use tools, to build shelter, to invent agriculture, to keep farm animals, to develop civilization and culture, to cure and prevent disease. Our tools and technologies have helped us to shape the environment around us.\n\nI'm a positive person. I believe in progress. I'd much rather be alive today than at any time in history - and not just because in an earlier age my skills wouldn't have been as valuable and I'd have been a good candidate for an animal's dinner. The tools of the Industrial Age extended the capacities of our muscles. The tools of the digital age extend the capacities of our minds. I'm even happier for my children, who will grow up in this new world.\n\nBy joining the digital age enthusiastically, we can accelerate the positive effects and do better with the challenges, such as privacy and the problem of \"haves\" and \"have-nots\". If we sit back and wait for the digital age to come to us on terms defined by others, we won't be able to do either. The Web lifestyle can increase the involvement of citizens in government. Many of the decisions that need to be made are political and social, not technical. These include how we make sure that everyone can get on the Web and how we protect children. Citizens in every culture must join in the discussion about the effects of digital technology, to make sure that the new digital age reflects the society they want to create.\n\nThe digital world certainly makes it tough and uncertain for business, but we will all benefit. We're going to get improved products and services, better responses to complaints, lower costs, and more choices. We're going to get better government and social services that cost a lot less. This world is coming. A big part of it comes through businesses using a digital nervous system to improve their processes. A digital nervous system can help business define itself and its role in the future, but success or failure depends on business leaders. Only you can prepare your organization and invest in ways that take advantage of the rapidly dawning digital age.\n\nDigital tools extend the abilities that make us unique in the world: the ability to think, the ability to express our thoughts, the ability to work together to act on those thoughts. I strongly believe that if companies give their employees the power to solve problems, and give them powerful tools to do this with, they will always be amazed at how much creative and independent thinking will appear.\n\n",
        "ru": "Глава первая. Информационный поток - это ваша жизненная сила.\n\nИнформационная работа - это работа мышления. Когда мышлению и совместной работе значительно помогают компьютерные технологии, у вас есть цифровая нервная система. Он состоит из передовых цифровых процессов, которые работники умственного труда используют для принятия лучших решений - думать, действовать, реагировать и адаптироваться. Майкл Дертузос из Массачусетского технологического института пишет, что будущий \"информационный рынок\" потребует большого количества специального программного обеспечения и сложных комбинаций человеческих и машинных процессов - отличное описание работы цифровой нервной системы.\n\nРассматриваете ли вы информационные технологии как способ решения конкретных проблем? Тогда вы, вероятно, получаете только часть преимуществ, которые могут предоставить современные компьютеры и программное обеспечение. Вместо этого вы должны создавать системы, которые будут немедленно доставлять информацию любому, кто может ее использовать, - \"цифровые нервные системы\".\n\nКак руководитель Microsoft, самой успешной в мире компании по разработке программного обеспечения, я сыграл большую роль в рождении информационной эры. В этой книге я объясняю идею цифровой нервной системы-использование информационных технологий для удовлетворения потребностей людей на работе и дома, так же как человеческая нервная система поддерживает человеческий разум.\n\nКак и живое существо, организация работает лучше всего, если она может полагаться на нервную систему, которая немедленно посылает информацию тем частям, которые в ней нуждаются. Цифровая нервная система может объединить все системы и процессы организации, высвобождая потоки информации и позволяя бизнесу совершать огромные скачки в эффективности, росте и прибыли. У меня есть простое, но сильное убеждение: то, как вы собираете, управляете и используете информацию, решит, выиграете вы или проиграете.\n\nЛучший способ установить дистанцию между вашей компанией и толпой-это отлично работать с информацией. Сегодня конкурентов стало больше. Существует больше информации о них и о рынке, который сейчас находится во всем мире. Победителями станут те, кто разработает цифровую нервную систему мирового уровня, чтобы информация могла легко проходить через их компании для максимального и постоянного обучения.\n\nЯ знаю, что вы скажете: нет, это эффективные процессы! Это качество! Это завоевание доли рынка и создание узнаваемых брендов! Он приближается к клиентам! Успех, конечно, зависит от всего этого. Никто не сможет помочь вам, если ваши процессы неэффективны, если вы не заботитесь о качестве, если вы не усердно работаете над созданием своего бренда, если ваше обслуживание клиентов плохое. Плохой бизнес-план потерпит неудачу, как бы хороша ни была ваша информация. А плохая практика испортит хороший план. Если вы сделаете достаточно плохих вещей, вы выйдете из бизнеса.\n\nНо что бы ни было на вашей стороне сегодня-умные сотрудники, отличные продукты, лояльные клиенты, наличные деньги в банке - вам нужен быстрый поток хорошей информации, чтобы сделать процессы эффективными, повысить качество и улучшить то, как вы реализуете свой план на практике. В большинстве компаний работают хорошие люди. Большинство компаний хотят хорошо относиться к своим клиентам. Хорошие, полезные данные существуют где-то внутри большинства организаций. Информационный поток-это жизненная сила вашей компании, потому что он позволяет вам получать максимальную отдачу от ваших сотрудников и учиться у ваших клиентов. Посмотрите, есть ли у вас информация, чтобы ответить на эти вопросы:\n\n- Что клиенты думают о вашей продукции? Какие проблемы они хотят, чтобы вы исправили? Какие новые функции они хотят, чтобы вы добавили?\n\n- Какие проблемы возникают у ваших партнеров, когда они продают вашу продукцию или работают с вами?\n\n- Где ваши конкуренты выигрывают бизнес у вас и почему?\n\n- Изменяющиеся требования клиентов заставят вас развивать новые мощности?\n\n- Какие новые рынки появляются, на которые вы должны выйти?\n\nЦифровая нервная система не гарантирует вам правильных ответов на эти вопросы. Но это освободит вас от старых бумажных процессов, так что у вас будет время подумать над вопросами. Это даст вам данные, чтобы начать думать немедленно,и увидеть тенденции, идущие на вас. Цифровая нервная система позволит фактам и идеям быстро всплыть из глубин вашей организации, от людей, у которых есть информация об этих вопросах и, вероятно, многие ответы. Самое главное, это позволит вам делать все эти вещи быстро.\n\nСтарая деловая шутка гласит, что если бы железные дороги понимали, что они занимаются транспортным бизнесом, а не сталелитейным, мы бы все летали на \"Юнион Пасифик Эйрлайнз\". Многие компании изменили свои цели еще более фундаментальными способами. Но не всегда ясно, где находится следующая возможность роста.\n\nMcdonald'S имеет самый сильный бренд и долю рынка, а также хорошую репутацию за качество. Но недавно проведенный анализ рынка предложил компании изменить свою бизнес-модель. Mcdonald's время от времени продвигал игрушки, связанные с фильмами. Анализ показал, что компания должна использовать свой хорошо известный мелкодоходный продукт для продажи высокодоходных игрушек, а не наоборот. Такое изменение маловероятно, но не немыслимо в современном быстро меняющемся деловом мире.\n\nНи одна компания не может считать, что ее положение на рынке безопасно. Компания должна постоянно думать о своих возможностях. Одна компания может быть чрезвычайно успешной, если она ворвется в другой бизнес. Другая компания может обнаружить, что ей следует придерживаться того, что она знает и делает лучше всего. Самое главное, что менеджеры компании имеют информацию, чтобы понять, где они могут конкурировать и каким может быть их следующий большой рынок.\n\nЭта книга поможет вам использовать информационные технологии, чтобы задать и ответить на трудные вопросы о том, каким должен быть ваш бизнес и куда он должен идти. Информационные технологии дают вам данные, которые ведут к более глубокому пониманию вашего бизнеса. Это позволяет вам действовать быстро. Он предоставляет решения бизнес-задач, которые просто не были доступны раньше. Информационные технологии и бизнес становятся настолько тесно связанными, что вы не можете говорить об одном, не говоря о другом.\n\nПервый шаг в ответе на любой трудный деловой вопрос-взглянуть на факты. Это легче сказать, чем сделать. Этот принцип проиллюстрирован в моей любимой бизнес-книге \"Мои годы в General Motors\" Альфреда Слоуна-младшего. Если Вы читаете только одну деловую книгу, прочтите книгу Слоана (но не откладывайте ее, чтобы сделать это). Экстраординарный успех может быть достигнут благодаря позитивному лидерству, основанному на информации и разуме.\n\nВо время пребывания Слоуна на посту босса, с 1923 по 1956 год, General Motors стала одной из первых действительно сложных бизнес-организаций в Соединенных Штатах. Слоан понимал, что компания не может разработать широкий бизнес-план или выбрать правильные проекты, не опираясь на факты и понимание людей в компании. Он развил собственное понимание бизнеса, работая в тесном контакте со своими сотрудниками и регулярно посещая технические отделы компании. Однако наибольшее влияние на него как менеджера оказали рабочие отношения с дилерами GM по всей стране. Он постоянно собирал информацию от дилеров GM и работал над тем, чтобы наладить с ними тесные отношения, которые давали результаты.\n\nСлоан считала, что ознакомительные поездки очень важны. Поэтому он построил офис в частном железнодорожном вагоне и путешествовал по всей стране, посещая дилеров. Он часто видел от пяти до десяти дилеров в день. Эти визиты помогли Слоану увидеть, что автомобильный бизнес меняется. Он перешел от простой продажи к торговле, поскольку люди хотели обменять свои старые автомобили, когда они покупали новые. Слоан понимал, что отношения GM с дилерами тоже должны измениться. Производитель и дилеры должны были стать партнерами. Слоан сформировал дилерский совет, чтобы регулярно встречаться с высшими руководителями GM. Он также создал отдел для рассмотрения жалоб от дилеров. Он платил за экономические исследования, чтобы найти лучшие места для новых дилеров, и даже нашел способ одалживать деньги \"способным людям\", у которых не было денег, чтобы стать дилерами.\n\nТочную информацию о продажах по-прежнему было трудно найти. Когда прибыль дилера падала, GM не знала почему. Без фактов невозможно было понять, что делать. Слоан сказал, что заплатит много денег, чтобы каждый дилер \" знал факты о своем бизнесе и мог разумно разобраться со многими деталями... в интеллигентной манере\". Это будет \"лучшая инвестиция, которую когда-либо делал General Motors\".\n\nСлоан создал стандартизированную систему счетов для всей организации GM и всех ее дилеров. Каждый дилер и каждый сотрудник, на каждом уровне компании, помещают свои номера в точно такие же категории. К середине 1930-х годов дилеры GM, ее заводы и офисы могли проводить детальный финансовый анализ, используя одни и те же цифры. Дилер, например, мог четко видеть, насколько хорошо он работает, а также сравнивать свои результаты со средними показателями по всей компании.\n\nИнфраструктура, предоставляющая точную информацию, привела к тому, что компания быстро реагировала на события. Другие автопроизводители десятилетиями не могли конкурировать с GM. Эта инфраструктура - то, что я называю нервной системой компании, - помогала GM доминировать в автомобильном бизнесе на протяжении всей карьеры Слоана. Он еще не был цифровым, но был чрезвычайно ценным.\n\nКонечно, тогда вы не могли получить почти столько же информации, проходящей через вашу компанию, сколько сейчас. Потребовалось бы слишком много телефонных звонков и слишком много людей, перемещающих бумагу и просматривающих данные, чтобы найти закономерности. Это было бы очень дорого. Если вы хотите управлять компанией мирового класса сегодня, вам нужно получить гораздо больше данных и сделать это гораздо быстрее. Чтобы управлять силой фактов - один из бизнес-принципов Слоуна-требуются информационные технологии.\n\nЕсли семьдесят лет назад управление информацией и быстрое реагирование имели такое фундаментальное значение в традиционной отрасли, то насколько большее значение они будут иметь, когда будут питаться информационными технологиями? Современный автопроизводитель может сегодня иметь сильную марку и репутацию качества, но он сталкивается с еще большей конкуренцией со всего мира.\n\nВсе автопроизводители используют одну и ту же сталь и одни и те же машины; у них схожие производственные процессы и примерно одинаковые транспортные расходы. Сегодня критерием успеха является то, насколько хорошо они разрабатывают свои продукты, насколько разумно они используют информацию от своих клиентов для улучшения своих продуктов и услуг, насколько быстро они могут улучшить свои производственные процессы, насколько умно они продают свои продукты и насколько эффективно они поставляют свои продукты и услуги клиентам. Все эти процессы богаты информацией, и они извлекают выгоду из цифровых технологий.\n\nЦенность цифрового подхода особенно очевидна в таких компаниях, как банки и страховые компании, где информация занимает центральное место в бизнесе. В банковском деле данные о клиентах - это сердце бизнеса, и банки всегда были большими пользователями информационных технологий. Crestar Bank of Richmond, штат Вирджиния, предлагает все свои банковские услуги через Интернет. У него есть банковские служащие в супермаркетах и торговых центрах, которые могут предлагать банковские услуги клиентам, используя цифровой информационный поток.\n\nВ эпоху интернета и растущей конкуренции на финансовых рынках ключом к успеху является разумность использования банком данных и то, насколько хорошо он реагирует на своих клиентов. Именно мозги дают преимущество тому или иному банку. Но я имею в виду не только индивидуальные способности банковских служащих. Я имею в виду общую способность банка использовать лучшее мышление всех своих сотрудников.\n\nПосле появления ENIAC, первого компьютера общего назначения, во время Второй мировой войны компьютеры быстро доказали, что они быстрее и точнее людей во многих задачах. Однако компьютеры работали не на высоком уровне. Они помогали людям, но не разумно. Требуется мозг, чтобы понять физику ракеты; требуется компьютер, чтобы сделать вычисления за секунды.\n\nБизнесу нужна другая работа - \"информационная\". Эта фраза принадлежит Майклу Дертузосу, директору лаборатории компьютерных наук Массачусетского технологического института и автору книги \"Что будет\". Обычно мы воспринимаем информацию-письмо, фотографию или финансовый отчет-как нечто неизменное. Но Дертузос утверждает, что активна и другая форма информации. Информационная работа - это обработка информации человеческим мозгом или компьютерными программами.\n\nИнформационная работа-проектирование здания, заключение сделки, заполнение налоговых форм-это большая часть работы, выполняемой в развитых странах. По оценкам дертузоса, информационная работа составляет от 50 до 60 процентов от общей стоимости товаров и услуг, производимых промышленно развитой страной.\n\nИдея Dertouzos важно. Когда компьютеры перешли от простой работы с числами к моделированию бизнес-задач, они начали играть определенную роль в информационной работе. Даже производственные фирмы всегда вкладывали больше энергии в информацию о работе, чем в саму работу: информацию о дизайне и разработке продукта; о маркетинге, продажах и поставках; о платежах и финансах; о сотрудничестве с продавцами; об обслуживании клиентов.\n\nЧтобы заниматься информационной работой, люди в компании должны уметь легко находить информацию. Однако до недавнего времени нам говорили, что \"номера\" должны быть зарезервированы для самых старших руководителей. Иногда есть веские причины для секретности, но обычно информация была зарезервирована просто потому, что для перемещения информации требовалось время, деньги и усилия, поэтому вы должны были быть старшим, чтобы заказать работу. В современных компьютерных сетях можно легко и дешево найти и представить данные. Вы можете погрузиться в данные до самого низкого уровня детализации и посмотреть на них с разных сторон. Вы можете обмениваться информацией и идеями с другими людьми. Вы можете объединить идеи и работу многих людей для лучшего результата.\n\nНам нужно перестать думать, что получение информации и перемещение информации-это сложно и дорого. Это просто элементарный здравый смысл, чтобы сделать все данные вашей компании легко доступными для каждого человека, который может их использовать.\n\nВсе сотрудники компании, а не только ее высокопоставленные руководители, должны видеть бизнес-данные. Для меня, как для главного исполнительного директора, важно понимать, как работает компания в разных регионах, продуктовых линейках или различных типах клиентов, и я горжусь тем, что всегда в курсе событий. Однако именно менеджеры среднего звена в каждой компании должны понимать, откуда берутся их прибыли и убытки, какие маркетинговые программы работают или нет, а какие расходы находятся под контролем или слишком высоки. Это люди, которым нужны точные, полезные данные, потому что именно они должны действовать. Они не должны ждать, пока высшее руководство принесет им информацию. Компании должны тратить меньше времени на защиту финансовых данных от сотрудников и больше времени на обучение их анализу и действиям.\n\nВо многих компаниях менеджеры среднего звена могут утонуть в повседневных проблемах и не иметь информации, необходимой для их решения. Признаком хорошей цифровой нервной системы является то, что менеджеры среднего звена становятся более эффективными благодаря потоку точной, полезной информации. Системы должны сообщать им о необычных событиях-например, если статья расходов слишком высока. Тогда менеджерам не нужно смотреть на нормальную расходную деятельность. Некоторые компании работают подобным образом, но я постоянно удивляюсь тому, как мало компаний используют информационные технологии, чтобы держать своих менеджеров среднего звена в курсе и избегать рутинной проверки.\n\nМеня поражает извилистый путь, по которому важная информация часто проходит через многие компании из списка Fortune 500. В Mcdonald'S до недавнего времени данные о продажах приходилось \"трогать\" вручную несколько раз, прежде чем они попадали к людям, которые в них нуждались. Сегодня Mcdonald's устанавливает новую информационную систему, которая обрабатывает продажи во всех своих ресторанах в режиме реального времени. Как только вы закажете два Happy Meals, менеджер по маркетингу Mcdonald's узнает об этом. Так что у менеджера будут твердые факты для анализа продаж, а не ненадежные данные.\n\nКак мы увидим в описании реакции Microsoft на интернет, еще одним признаком хорошей цифровой нервной системы является количество хороших идей, исходящих от ваших менеджеров среднего звена и работников умственного труда. Когда они могут анализировать реальные данные, люди получают подробные идеи о том, как сделать вещи лучше-и они тоже возбуждаются. Людям нравится знать, что то, что они делают, работает, и им нравится показывать менеджерам, что это работает. Им нравится использовать технологии, которые побуждают их проверять различные теории о том, что происходит на их рынках. Люди действительно ценят информацию.\n\nПоследний признак хорошей цифровой нервной системы - насколько эффективны ваши личные встречи. Хорошие встречи - это результат хорошей подготовки. Встречи не должны использоваться главным образом для представления информации. Более эффективно использовать электронную почту, чтобы люди могли анализировать данные перед встречей. Затем они будут готовы внести свои предложения и обсудить вопросы на самой встрече.\n\nКомпании, которые борются со слишком большим количеством непродуктивных встреч, не испытывают недостатка в энергии и мозгах. Данные, которые им нужны, существуют где-то в компании в той или иной форме. Цифровые инструменты позволят им получать данные немедленно, из многих источников,и анализировать их под разными углами.\n\nАльфред Слоун из GM сказал, что без фактов невозможно реализовать эффективный план. Я считаю, что если у вас есть хорошие факты, вы можете привести в действие эффективный план. Слоан так и сделала, много раз. При той скорости, с которой сегодня движется бизнес, нам как никогда необходимо управлять силой фактов.\n\nТо, что я описываю здесь,-это новый уровень анализа информации, который позволяет работникам умственного труда превращать необработанные данные в активную информацию-то, что Майкл Дертузос называет знанием как глаголом. Цифровая нервная система позволяет компании выполнять информационную работу с большей эффективностью, глубиной и креативностью.\n\nМожет ли ваша цифровая нервная система сделать это?\n\nКак и человеку, компании нужна внутренняя коммуникационная система, \"нервная система\", чтобы организовать свои действия. Все предприятия концентрируются на нескольких основных вещах: клиенты, продукты и услуги, доходы, затраты, конкуренты, доставка и сотрудники. Компания должна выполнять бизнес-процессы в каждой области и следить за тем, чтобы они работали вместе, особенно в тех видах деятельности, которые пересекают отделы.\n\nОтдел продаж должен быстро выяснить, может ли компания поставлять продукт, прежде чем обещать доставить большой заказ. Производственный отдел должен знать, какой продукт сильно продается, чтобы он мог изменить приоритеты производства. Бизнес-менеджеры всей компании должны знать и о том, и о другом-и о многом другом.\n\nНервная система организации имеет параллели с нашей человеческой нервной системой. У каждого бизнеса есть определенные процессы, которые должны продолжаться, чтобы компания выжила, точно так же, как человеческое сердце должно продолжать биться. Необходимость быть эффективными и надежными побудила компании автоматизировать многие из этих основных операций. Но из-за того, что менеджеры принимали любые доступные решения, результатом со временем стало большое количество систем, которые не всегда работают вместе. Каждая независимая система может работать безотказно сама по себе, но данные в каждой изолированы и их трудно объединить с данными в других. Получение данных об операционных процессах и их использование - одна из самых сложных задач бизнеса. Но современные технологии могут сделать базовые операции основой гораздо более широкого, общекорпоративного интеллекта.\n\nКомпания должна быстро и хорошо реагировать на любой кризис или незапланированное событие. Возможно, Вам позвонит ваш лучший клиент и скажет, что он покупает у вашего крупнейшего конкурента, или этот конкурент может представить отличный новый продукт, или у вас может быть неисправный продукт или сломанная операция. Незапланированные события тоже могут быть позитивными. Вы можете получить неожиданную возможность для новой крупной деятельности или покупки.\n\nНаконец, существует сознательное управление мускулами вашей компании, независимо от того, создаете ли Вы команды для разработки новых продуктов, открываете новые офисы или посылаете людей, чтобы завоевать новых клиентов. Для успешного проведения этих запланированных мероприятий требуется тщательное обдумывание и стратегический анализ до и после того, как вы начнете действовать.\n\nВам нужно подумать об основных бизнес-проблемах вашей компании и разработать долгосрочный бизнес-план для решения проблем и использования возможностей, которые открывает ваш анализ. Затем вам нужно сообщить о том, что вы хотите сделать, и о планах, стоящих за этим, каждому человеку в компании, а также партнерам и другим соответствующим людям за пределами компании.\n\nОднако больше всего компания должна общаться со своими клиентами и действовать в соответствии с тем, что она узнает от них. Эта первичная потребность включает в себя все возможности компании: оперативную эффективность, сбор данных, сотрудничество, стратегическое планирование и действия. Необходимость общения с клиентами будет вновь и вновь подчеркиваться в этой книге. Я покажу, как цифровая нервная система помогает успешным компаниям делать это.\n\nЦифровая нервная система служит двум основным целям в развитии понимания бизнеса. Он расширяет способность индивида к анализу так же, как машины расширяют физические возможности, и он объединяет способности индивидов создавать интеллект компании и действовать как единое целое. Цифровая нервная система стремится создать совершенство компании из индивидуального совершенства, чтобы служить клиенту.\n\nЦифровая нервная система дает людям, работающим в вашей компании, те же самые данные для ежедневного использования в бизнесе, которые вы даете кому-то, кого вы привлекаете, чтобы проконсультироваться с ними о проблеме. С их многолетним опытом работы в отрасли и знаниями бизнес-анализа консультанты часто приходят с новыми идеями после того, как они изучили данные. Но разве это не безумие, что кто-то за пределами компании получает больше информации, чем вы используете для себя? Слишком часто важная информация о клиентах и продажах сводится воедино только тогда, когда приходит консультант. Вы должны иметь эту информацию там каждый день, готовую к использованию вашими сотрудниками. Ваши менеджеры должны иметь информацию того же качества, что и консультант. Как мы увидим в следующем примере, хорошие вещи случаются, когда у них есть эта информация.\n\nВ Microsoft наша команда продаж обращается только к крупным корпорациям.\n\nПоэтому каждый год Джефф Рейкс, человек, отвечающий за продажи и поддержку, борется с проблемой того, как выйти на рынок для мелких и средних клиентов. Мы обычно достигаем этих клиентов через семинары и маркетинг с партнерами. Но где же большинство этих клиентов? Все ли они в крупнейших городах? Какие города мы должны выбрать для маркетинга?\n\nИз интернета мы нашли среднее количество сотрудников на одну компанию в каждом городе. От сторонних консультантов мы получили информацию о количестве персональных компьютеров (ПК) в каждом городе. От наших менеджеров по маркетингу мы получили информацию о наших семинарах и работе с партнерами. Наконец, мы включили количество партнеров в каждом городе.\n\nИспользуя компьютеры, мы искали соответствие между цифрами продаж и маркетинговой активностью. Программа Microsoft, MS Sales, дала нам данные в двух важных областях: данные о продажах за прошлый год, которые помогли нам рассчитать рост, и доход от продаж по почтовым районам. Мы нашли восемьдесят городов, которые, по нашему мнению, были вероятными кандидатами для новой маркетинговой кампании. Но в Microsoft, прежде чем вкладывать деньги, мы хотим знать, сработает ли эта идея. Мы снова проверили восемьдесят городов с помощью маркетинговой программы, ища восемь к одному рентабельности инвестиций (ROI). Установив ROI на уровне восемь к одному, мы могли бы исключить любые города, где процентная доходность может быть высокой, но абсолютная доходность в долларах будет низкой. Это дало нам сорок пять городов, позже уменьшенных до тридцати восьми.\n\nВ каждом из этих тридцати восьми городов, в которых мы раньше не занимались маркетингом, мы провели два \"больших дня\". В каждый большой день мы показывали продукты Microsoft и делали предложения по продажам вместе с нашими партнерами. Рентабельность инвестиций была удивительной-двадцать к одному-30 миллионов долларов прибыли на 1,5 миллиона долларов инвестиций. По мере того, как происходили события большого дня, мы использовали программу MS Sales для измерения нашей доходности по сравнению с цифрами на аналогичных рынках, чтобы увидеть, действительно ли большие дни имели значение. Результаты: города, в которых мы проводили мероприятия большого дня, показали 57-процентное увеличение дохода против 16-процентного увеличения дохода в контрольной группе из девятнадцати небольших городов, в которых не было больших дней.\n\nСегодня программа, которая определила целевые города, была усовершенствована, так что каждый в компании может видеть будущие возможности продаж не только по площади, но и по продукту. Поэтому вместо семинара со всеми продуктами Microsoft мы можем узнать, нужен ли одному городу семинар по Microsoft Office, другому-по Windows, а третьему-по Exchange.\n\nВсе это из-за программы продаж MS. Бумажная система не могла бы выполнить эту работу. Данные о продажах теперь поступают к нам таким образом, что мы можем сразу же поместить их в MS Sales. Это недорого, и поскольку мы делимся этими данными с нашими партнерами, обсуждение с ними будущих маркетинговых планов дает лучшие результаты. Эти обсуждения все еще являются старомодными очными встречами, но все на этих встречах лучше подготовлены из-за данных, которые они видели заранее.\n\nВ Microsoft наши информационные системы также изменили роль наших менеджеров. Когда MS Sales впервые вышла в интернет, один из наших менеджеров в Миннеаполисе проверил продажи в ее районе на уровне деталей, который раньше был невозможен. Она обнаружила, что отличные общие показатели продаж в ее районе скрывают плохие продажи крупным клиентам. Выяснение этого стало шоком для большой команды по продажам клиентов, но это также был первый шаг к тому, чтобы все исправить. К концу года Миннеаполис стал самым быстрорастущим районом для продаж крупным клиентам.\n\nЕсли вы сегодня менеджер в Microsoft, вы должны быть не просто хорошим руководителем отдела продаж. Теперь вы можете быть бизнес-мыслителем, потому что у вас есть данные, которые помогут вам управлять вашим бизнесом. Вы можете посмотреть на показатели продаж и увидеть, где ваш бизнес силен, а где слаб, и какие продукты вы можете продавать, в каких областях, в каких фирмах. Вы можете попробовать новые программы и посмотреть на результаты. Вы можете поговорить с другими менеджерами о том, что они делают, чтобы получить хорошие результаты. Менеджеры в Microsoft играют сейчас гораздо более важную роль, чем пять лет назад, благодаря разработанным нами простым в использовании компьютерным программам.\n\nЦифровая нервная система дает своим пользователям понимание и способность узнавать вещи, которые они иначе не имели бы. Хороший поток информации и хорошие инструменты для анализа позволяют нам видеть новые возможности для получения прибыли среди больших объемов данных. Она наилучшим образом использует возможности человеческого мозга и сокращает человеческий труд.\n\nЧтобы начать создавать цифровую нервную систему, вы должны сначала составить идеальную картину информации, необходимой для ведения бизнеса и понимания рынков и конкурентов. Подумайте хорошенько о фактах, которые вам нужно знать. Составьте список наиболее важных вопросов для вашего бизнеса. Затем потребуйте, чтобы ваши информационные системы предоставили ответы. Если ваша нынешняя система не будет этого делать, вам нужно разработать такую, которая будет. Если вы этого не сделаете, это сделает один или несколько ваших конкурентов.\n\nВы знаете, что создали отличную цифровую нервную систему, когда информация течет через вашу организацию так же быстро и естественно, как мысль в человеческом существе, и когда вы можете использовать технологию для организации команд людей так же быстро, как вы можете управлять человеком. Это бизнес со скоростью мысли.\n\nЦифровые технологии могут полностью изменить ваши производственные процессы и бизнес-процессы. Он также может освободить работников от медленных бумажных процессов. Замена бумажных процессов цифровыми позволяет работникам умственного труда выполнять более полезную работу. Полностью цифровое рабочее место обычно называют \"безбумажным офисом\", фраза, которая восходит по крайней мере к 1973 году. Это великое видение. Больше никаких стопок бумаги, в которых вы не можете найти то, что вам нужно. Больше никаких поисков в кучах отчетов, чтобы найти маркетинговую информацию или номер продаж. Но безбумажный офис, похоже, так и не появился.\n\nКорпорация Xerox сделала для продвижения этой концепции больше, чем любая другая компания. В 1974-5 годах речь шла о \"офисе будущего\", который будет иметь компьютеры и электронную почту с информацией онлайн. Между 1975 и 1987 годами несколько деловых газет обещали, что безбумажный офис не за горами, но в 1988 году я сказал журналисту: \"это видение безбумажного офиса все еще очень, очень далеко\".\n\nСегодня у нас есть все необходимое для создания безбумажного офиса. Более совершенные компьютеры и программное обеспечение позволяют легко комбинировать данные различных типов. Высокоэффективные сетевые компьютеры есть везде в офисной среде. Интернет соединяет компьютеры по всему миру. Но использование бумаги продолжает удваиваться каждые четыре года, и 95 процентов всей информации в Соединенных Штатах остается на бумаге, по сравнению с только 1 процентом, хранящимся в электронном виде. Бумага растет быстрее, чем цифровые технологии могут ее уменьшить!\n\nВ 1996 году я решил посмотреть, как Microsoft все еще использует бумагу. К моему удивлению, в тот год мы напечатали 350 000 бумажных копий отчетов о продажах. Я попросил копию каждой бумажной формы, которую мы использовали. Толстая папка, лежавшая на моем столе, содержала сотни и сотни бланков. Использование бумаги было лишь признаком более серьезной проблемы: административные процессы были слишком сложными и занимали слишком много времени.\n\nЯ посмотрел на папку и подумал: \"Зачем нам все эти бланки? У каждого здесь есть компьютер. Мы связаны. Почему мы не используем электронные формы и электронную почту\"? Как главный исполнительный директор я отдал приказ запретить все ненужные формы. Вместо всей этой бумаги выросли системы, которые были более точными и простыми в работе и которые освободили наших людей для более интересной работы.\n\nТеперь, еще до того, как мы нанимаем нового работника, он или она начинает электронное путешествие. Мы получаем информацию о карьере от 600 до 900 человек, претендующих на работу каждый день, через почту, по электронной почте по адресу resume@microsoft.com. или на веб-сайте Microsoft по адресу www.microsoft.com/jobs. Семьдесят процентов информации о карьере теперь поступает по электронной почте или на веб-сайт, по сравнению с 6 процентами два года назад. Вся информация о карьере от людей, претендующих на работу, сопоставляется с открытыми рабочими местами в течение сорока восьми часов, иногда в течение двадцати четырех часов.\n\nПрограммное обеспечение настраивает собеседования. Каждый интервьюер получает информацию о карьере человека, претендующего на эту работу, по электронной почте. После собеседования каждый интервьюер присылает свои комментарии кандидату по электронной почте. Такой обмен информацией гарантирует, что интервьюеры будут опираться на работу друг друга,а не повторять ее. Если очевидно, что Microsoft хочет кандидата, сигнал электронной почты говорит интервьюеру объяснить этому человеку, почему Microsoft будет хорошим выбором для него.\n\nДопустим, некто по имени Шэрон Холлоуэй принимает наше предложение о работе. Воображаемая Шарон-одна из восьмидесяти пяти новых сотрудников, которых мы нанимаем каждую неделю. Скажем, что Шарон в Редмонде, штат Вашингтон. Прежде чем Шарон приходит в Microsoft, помощник по администрированию в ее новом отделе заполняет новую форму найма в интранете Microsoft, чтобы запросить офисную мебель и компьютер с программным обеспечением, электронную почту и голосовую почту, чтобы быть готовым для Шарон. Та же форма гарантирует, что имя Шарон будет добавлено в список телефонов компании, и что она получит табличку для двери своего офиса и почтовый ящик в почтовом отделении здания.\n\nКогда она приезжает, Шэрон выходит в интернет, чтобы прочитать руководство для сотрудников (сейчас его нет на бумаге), и она загружает любое программное обеспечение, которое ей нужно. Затем Шарон использует программу под названием MS Market для заказа канцелярских принадлежностей, книг, доски и визитных карточек. Мисс Маркет автоматически вписывает в заказ свое имя, адрес электронной почты и имя менеджера. Поставщики получают ее запрос по электронной почте и доставляют материалы в ее офис. Заказ, превышающий определенную сумму денег, будет автоматически отправлен менеджеру, прежде чем он отправится поставщику.\n\nЗарплата Шарон поступает на ее счет по электронной почте, и если она хочет, то может поменять свой банк онлайн. Для путешествий Шарон использует программу, разработанную Microsoft в партнерстве с American Express, под названием AXI. Он доступен в интернете двадцать четыре часа в сутки, семь дней в неделю.\n\nНекоторые люди думают, что у\" Микрософтов \" нет жизни вне компании, но на самом деле это так. Шэрон выходит замуж и отправляется в отпуск со своим новым мужем. Она вводит свое отпускное время онлайн. Когда они с мужем переезжают в новый дом, Шарон вводит свой новый адрес в интернете один раз, и он автоматически отправляется в каждый отдел, которому нужен ее адрес. Она посещает наш интранет, чтобы получить информацию о автобусных маршрутах и совместном использовании поездок в своем новом районе.\n\nКогда у Шарон и ее мужа рождается ребенок, она выходит в интернет, чтобы узнать о семинарах для родителей, оплачиваемом отпуске для родителей и дневном уходе за детьми. Microsoft платит определенную сумму в виде льгот каждому сотруднику компании, и они могут воспользоваться этими преимуществами многими способами. Они могут посмотреть на различные способы объединения преимуществ в интернете. Она также может покупать и продавать акции онлайн, используя компанию, которая покупает и продает акции для всех, кто работает в Microsoft, Saloman Smith Barney. Шарон может покупать и продавать акции Microsoft и использовать свой голос в качестве акционера онлайн.\n\nИспользование нашей компьютерной сети для замены бумажных бланков дало нам впечатляющие результаты. Пока я пишу эту книгу, мы сократили количество бумажных бланков с более чем 1000 до шестидесяти. В целом экономия от использования электронных форм составила не менее 40 миллионов долларов за первые двенадцать месяцев использования в 1997-8 годах. Наибольшая экономия была получена за счет снижения затрат на переработку. Бухгалтерские фирмы оценивают стоимость каждого бумажного заказа-в основном время всех людей, обрабатывающих бумагу, - примерно в 145 долларов. Электронная обработка в Microsoft стоит менее 5 долларов за заказ.\n\nПо мере того как мы изобретали новые решения, наш центральный бюджет информационных технологий, который охватывает эти и другие основные сферы бизнеса, сократился на 3 процента в период с 1996 по 1999 год, в основном из-за стандартизации данных и сокращения количества информационных систем, которыми мы располагаем.\n\nЭлектронные инструменты дают нам преимущества помимо снижения затрат. Например, наше программное обеспечение Microsoft Market запрашивает полномочия, прежде чем обработать запрос. Это предотвращает неуместные покупки, которые могут легко пройти через бумажную систему. Информация о доставке печатается на машинке, а не пишется от руки, поэтому почти ничего не отправляется в неправильное место назначения. Связь с нашими поставщиками документирована, и мы заранее знаем затраты, так что никаких сюрпризов нет. Нашим поставщикам платят быстрее, а это значит, что они хотят доставить товар быстро. Мы всегда открываем для себя новые преимущества.\n\nПереход от бумажных форм к электронным является важным шагом в развитии нервной системы современной организации, но вы должны использовать это изменение для улучшения процессов, которые являются центральными для вашего бизнеса. Цифровую нервную систему легко построить. Хорошая сеть, хорошая система электронной почты и простые в построении веб-страницы-это все, что вам нужно для избавления от внутренних бумажных форм. Наши внутренние инструменты преследуют две цели: использовать программное обеспечение для решения рутинных задач, чтобы наши работники умственного труда не тратили время и энергию; и освободить людей для выполнения более сложной работы и решения необычных ситуаций. Наши внутренние разработчики используют правило\" сорт-вареное яйцо\": пользователь должен иметь возможность входить и выходить из большинства административных инструментов в течение трех минут. Это гарантирует, что мы не создаем неуклюжие инструменты и не вызываем больше работы в целом.\n\nСовершенствование административных и внутренних бизнес-процессов является важным способом повышения общей эффективности работы ваших сотрудников. Когда вы даете работникам умственного труда хорошие внутренние инструменты, вы также посылаете им важное сообщение: когда сотрудники видят, что компания повышает эффективность и избавляется от рутинных административных задач, отнимающих много времени, они знают, что компания ценит их время и хочет, чтобы они использовали его с пользой.\n\nЭто легко измерить, когда вы делаете своих заводских рабочих более эффективными. Трудно измерить, когда вы делаете своих работников умственного труда более эффективными, но вполне логично, что работники, которые не обременены рутинными задачами, будут работать лучше. Преимущество для клиентов заключается в том, что ваши сотрудники тратят меньше времени на бумажную работу и больше времени на потребности клиентов.\n\nГлава вторая.\n\nКоммерция: Интернет.\n\nВсе Меняется.\n\nОседлай ракету перемен.\n\nНе так давно я выступал перед советом директоров одного немецкого финансового учреждения. Это были опытные бизнесмены. Самому молодому из них было, вероятно, пятьдесят пять, и многим из них было за шестьдесят. Они видели много изменений в банковском деле и пережили много технологических изменений. Однако банк еще не начал использовать новые интернет-технологии.\n\nВ день моего визита они услышали серию разговоров от сотрудников Microsoft о компании. Когда я вошел в комнату, все они сидели там, скрестив руки на груди, и выглядели несчастными.\n\n- Ладно, - сказал я. В чем проблема\"?\n\nОдин из них ответил: \"Мы думаем, что банковское дело находится в процессе полного изменения, и мы получаем технические переговоры от людей здесь, в Microsoft - более технические, чем мы привыкли\". Он снял очки, протер глаза и сказал: \"Это, наверное, хорошо, хотя и утомляет\". Помолчав, он продолжил: \"Это хорошо, что вы просто собираетесь сделать все ваши продукты лучше, но каков общий план? Чтобы рассматривать вас как долгосрочного поставщика, нам нужно, чтобы вы дали нам видение будущего. Каковы ваши организационные принципы развития\"?\n\nСтарший руководитель Microsoft, который заканчивает встречу с клиентами, обычно не приносит подготовленную речь. Вместо этого человек отвечает на вопросы и делает резюме того, что мы будем делать в ответ на любые важные вопросы, которые возникли. Поэтому, стоя перед немецкими банкирами, я думал: \"о боже. Мы провели восемь часов, разговаривая с этим банком, и не ответили на основные вопросы клиента. Теперь мне придется делать это без записок\"...\n\nНо к тому времени я уже пару десятков раз выступал с докладом о цифровой нервной системе и работал над этой книгой почти год. Поэтому я начал записывать основные изменения, которые, как я думал, произойдут с технологией в ближайшем будущем. Я записал десять изменений, которые, как я думал, окажут значительное влияние на отрасли, сказал я банкирам. Это были важные изменения в поведении клиентов, которые были связаны с цифровыми технологиями и происходили сейчас.\n\n-Я хочу спросить вас, верите ли вы, что каждый из них произойдет. Не беспокойтесь сейчас о том, как быстро, просто скажите мне, верите ли вы, что они когда-нибудь произойдут. Если вы не верите, что они будут, то вы не должны менять то, что вы делаете с технологией. Но если вы верите, что они произойдут, и это только вопрос времени, то вы должны начать готовиться к этим изменениям уже сегодня\".\n\n\"Вы верите, что в будущем люди на работе будут использовать компьютеры каждый день для большинства своих рабочих мест?\" - Спросил я. \"Сегодня многие люди используют компьютеры время от времени, но многие работники умственного труда могут использовать свои компьютеры только несколько раз в день. Они могут даже пару дней обходиться без использования ПК. Верите ли вы, что сегодняшняя бумажная работа будет заменена более эффективными цифровыми процессами\"? Они так и сделали.\n\n- Ты веришь, что когда-нибудь в большинстве домов появятся компьютеры? В Соединенных Штатах сегодня около половины всех домов имеют компьютеры. В некоторых странах этот процент немного выше, но в большинстве других он значительно ниже. Вы верите, - спросил я, - что в один прекрасный день компьютеры будут так же распространены в домах, как телефоны или телевизоры? Они так и сделали.\n\n\"Верите ли вы, что когда-нибудь большинство предприятий и большинство домов будут иметь высокоскоростное подключение к всемирной паутине?\" - Спросил я. Они согласно кивнули.\n\n\"Вы верите, что электронная почта станет таким же распространенным способом общения между людьми в бизнесе и дома, как телефон или бумажная почта сегодня?\n\nСегодня не все пользуются электронной почтой, даже если у них есть компьютер. Изменится ли эта ситуация\"? Они согласились, что так и будет.\n\n- Итак, если большинство людей имеют компьютеры и пользуются ими каждый день, - спросил я, - вы верите, что большая часть информации начнет поступать в цифровом виде? Как вы думаете, ваши счета будут поступать в электронном виде? Как вы думаете, вы будете заказывать свои поездки через Интернет?\" Они согласились, что эти перемены грядут.\n\n\"Как вы думаете, цифровое оборудование станет обычным?\" - Спросил я. \"Вы думаете, что все телефоны, камеры, видео и телевизоры скоро станут цифровыми? Как вы думаете, появятся ли в доме другие новые машины и будут ли они подключены к сети?\" Они согласились, что это лишь вопрос времени.\n\n\"Видите ли вы, что придет время, когда ноутбуки станут компьютерными ноутбуками\"? Я описал, что имел в виду: компьютерный Блокнот-это новая машина, которая позволяет вам делать заметки, как вы делаете это сегодня на бумаге, и позволяет вам носить с собой все личные и профессиональные данные, которые вам нужны. Вероятно,это будет последнее изменение. \"Самое замечательное в компьютерном ноутбуке, - сказал я, - это то, что сколько бы вы в него ни вкладывали, он не становится больше или тяжелее\". Они рассмеялись. После тридцатисекундного разговора по-немецки один из них сказал:\"Мы подумали, что вы сказали что-то смешное, а потом поняли, что вы сказали что-то важное\".\n\n\"Я зря трачу ваше время\"? - Спросил я. - Ты веришь, что эти перемены когда-нибудь произойдут? К этому времени мы уже начали разговаривать. Они коротко переговорили между собой по-немецки. Банкир, который говорил до этого, сказал: \"Мы говорили о том же самом дома, и да, мы верим, что это произойдет. Когда это произойдет, это полностью изменит природу банковского дела\".\n\n-Как ты думаешь, когда это произойдет? - Спросил я. У них был другой, долгий разговор на немецком языке. Затем они сказали: \"Мы не ожидали, что примем это решение здесь, но мы приняли. Мы собирались рассказать вам о двадцати годах, но потом решили, что в течение десяти лет эти изменения либо наступят, либо станут очень скоро. Банковское дело будет совершенно другим\".\n\n\"Чтобы подготовиться к этим изменениям, - сказал я им, - вам нужно сделать цифровой поток информации повсюду в вашей организации\". Я вкратце рассказал о необходимости использования цифровых инструментов, которые они уже имели для своих работников умственного труда. Я говорил о цифровом соединении их систем знаний с бизнес-информационными системами для создания новой инфраструктуры вокруг ПК и интернет-технологий. Если они сделают это, сказал я им, они будут готовы к трем основным изменениям в бизнесе, которые произойдут в результате всех технологических достижений:\n\n1: большая часть контактов между бизнесом и клиентами, бизнесом и бизнесом, людьми и правительством станет цифровой и самообслуживаемой.\n\n2: обслуживание клиентов станет основным способом повышения ценности в каждом бизнесе. Участие человека в обслуживании будет смещаться от рутинных, малоценных задач к высокоценному личному обслуживанию клиента.\n\n3: скорость цифровых операций и потребность в более личном внимании к клиентам побудят компании внедрять цифровые процессы внутри компании, если они еще не внедрили их по соображениям эффективности. Компании будут использовать цифровую нервную систему для регулярной адаптации своих внутренних бизнес-процессов к среде, которая постоянно меняется из-за потребностей клиентов и конкуренции.\n\nСложные проблемы обслуживания клиентов и бизнеса потребуют мощных компьютеров с обеих сторон отношений-клиента и сотрудника,-сказал я. Новым отношениям будут способствовать различные электронные средства, такие как голос, видео и Интерактивное использование одного и того же экрана компьютера. Мы увидим мир, в котором довольно простые персональные компьютеры-компаньоны стали обычным явлением наряду с чрезвычайно мощными универсальными компьютерами, поддерживающими интеллектуальную работу дома или в офисе.\n\n\"Видение Microsoft, - закончил Я, - состоит в том, чтобы предоставить программное обеспечение, которое связывает все эти цифровые машины вместе и позволяет людям создавать цифровые решения, основанные на веб-образе жизни. Все очень просто\".\n\nУ правления немецкого банка был для меня последний вопрос, который волнует всех: что они должны сделать лично, чтобы подготовиться к этому новому цифровому миру? Мой ответ был таков: используйте инструменты сами. Высшие руководители должны использовать электронную почту и другие электронные инструменты, чтобы ознакомиться с новым способом ведения дел.\n\nОни должны видеть, как выглядят интернет-сайты их конкурентов. Они должны стать пользователями Интернета. Купите несколько книг и организуйте путешествие по Интернету, сказал я им, и посмотрите, на что это похоже. Если вы собираетесь возглавить цифровую эру, вам нужно достаточно хорошо познакомиться с Интернетом, чтобы иметь возможность представить, что веб-образ жизни будет означать для вашей отрасли-даже если изменение займет годы.\n\nВ течение многих лет энтузиасты говорили, что интернет появится \"завтра\". Вы будете продолжать читать предсказания о том, что большие перемены произойдут в ближайшие двенадцать месяцев. Это просто мусор. Социальные изменения, которые должны произойти, занимают годы, и инфраструктура должна быть расширена. Но когда социальные и технические изменения достигнут определенной точки, изменения будут быстрыми и постоянными. Наступит момент, когда веб-стиль жизни действительно взлетит, и я думаю, что это произойдет в ближайшие пять лет. Как я уже говорил, мы всегда переоцениваем изменения, которые произойдут в ближайшие два года, и недооцениваем изменения, которые произойдут в ближайшие десять. Не позволяйте себя одурачить и заставить ничего не делать.\n\nТрудно представить себе бизнес-категорию, в которой Интернет не будет иметь эффекта или в которой уже нет новых интернет-компаний. Многие фирмы сейчас мечтают стать первым интернет - книжным магазином или туристическим агентством, завоевав первых клиентов, общественный энтузиазм, известное имя.\n\nИнтернет-компании не просто изучают новые способы ведения бизнеса. Они также спешат сломать барьеры между различными сферами бизнеса. Amazon.com, которая начинала как интернет-книготорговец, начала продавать компакт-диски. У Amazon нет причин не продавать и другие продукты. Первоначальная причина выхода вашей компании в Интернет может заключаться в том, чтобы получить экономию средств и привлечь новых клиентов. Когда у вас есть клиенты, взаимодействующие с вами, у вас есть удивительная способность строить эти отношения, чтобы предложить более широкий набор продуктов.\n\nИнтернет-бизнес не похож на отделение банка, где можно обучить сотрудников лишь небольшому количеству продуктов. Виртуальная природа интернета позволяет делать любые покупки, которые хотят делать ваши клиенты. Вы увидите больше компаний, таких как Amazon, которые сильны в одной онлайн-области, а затем расширяют свои продуктовые предложения. Предостережение для каждого бизнеса состоит в том, что даже если никто в вашей отрасли не вскочит рано, крупные онлайн-компании, пытающиеся охватить каждую коммерческую область, перейдут в вашу.\n\nУзнайте об Интернете сегодня. Найдите некоторых из ваших клиентов, которые уже принимают веб-стиль жизни. Используйте эту группу для разработки моделей ведения бизнеса в целом. Не пройдет и десяти лет, как большинство ваших клиентов сменят вас, и вы будете готовы.\n\nПосредник должен добавить ценность\n\nЗдесь, в начале двадцать первого века, основным новым правилом бизнеса является то, что интернет меняет все. Интернет-технологии меняют то, как каждая компания, даже небольшая, имеет дело со своими сотрудниками, партнерами и поставщиками.\n\nНе каждая компания должна использовать Интернет для взаимодействия со своими клиентами прямо сейчас, но вскоре веб-сайт компании, где клиенты могут вести бизнес с фирмой, станет таким же важным, как телефон и почтовый адрес. У подавляющего большинства компаний из списка Fortune 500 уже есть веб-сайты. Интернет сокращает издержки и меняет отношения компаний со своими клиентами. Интернет создает большую конкуренцию среди продавцов и помогает продавцам найти возможных покупателей.\n\nВ доинтернетовские времена покупатели могли получать товары от большинства производителей только через посреднические структуры.\n\nСегодня клиенты могут вести бизнес непосредственно с производителями, стремящимися предложить интернет-услуги. Сегодня любой производитель может предоставить интернет-версию Заводского магазина.\n\nДо появления Интернета сбор всей информации о финансовых услугах, вариантах путешествий и других продуктах требовал много времени. Огромное количество сервисных компаний зарабатывали свои деньги, собирая и организуя такого рода информацию для клиентов. Сегодня, несмотря на несовершенные инструменты поиска, клиенты могут выйти в Интернет, чтобы найти гораздо больше нужной им информации. И любая компания может предоставить ценную информацию дешево в интернете, без филиалов.\n\nВ 1995 году в книге \"Дорога вперед\" я описал, как Интернет помогает создать идеальный рынок Адама Смита, на котором покупатели и продавцы могут легко найти друг друга, не тратя много времени и денег. Первая проблема на большинстве рынков-найти кого-то, с кем можно вести бизнес. Вторая проблема-это понимание природы и качества предлагаемых товаров и услуг. Интернет позволяет покупателю легко получить справочную информацию о товаре и легко сравнить цены. Покупатели также могут рассказать продавцам больше о том, что им нужно, и продавцы смогут ориентировать свои товары на людей, которые больше всего в них заинтересованы, и продавать сопутствующие товары.\n\nИнтернет-это отличный инструмент, помогающий клиентам найти лучшее предложение. Покупателям довольно легко переходить с одного сайта на другой, чтобы найти лучшие цены на некоторые товары. По крайней мере, две различные службы обеспечивают сравнение цен для клиентов, покупающих такие товары, как книги и компакт-диски. На некоторых туристических сайтах есть автоматические поисковики выгодных предложений, которые могут найти низкие тарифы на авиабилеты. По крайней мере, одна компания, Priceline.com, меняет отношения между покупателем и продавцом, предлагая покупателям цену, которую они готовы заплатить за автомобиль или билет на самолет, и предлагая эту цену различным продавцам. Пока неясно, насколько широко будет использоваться этот подход, но это возможно только через Интернет.\n\nСо временем программное обеспечение будет автоматизировать сравнение цен еще больше, пока они не станут легко электронными. По крайней мере, один интернет-магазин уже проверяет другие крупные сайты на предмет цен на часто покупаемые товары и автоматически снижает свои цены, чтобы убедиться, что они всегда немного ниже. Без магазинов, за которые нужно платить, продавец все равно может получить прибыль. Клиенты смогут объединиться в электронном виде, чтобы получить более низкие цены способами, которые раньше были непростыми. Будут даже случаи, когда программное обеспечение, представляющее продавца, ведет переговоры с программным обеспечением, представляющим сотни или тысячи клиентов.\n\nДля большинства продуктов, которые доступны во многих магазинах, клиенты получат наибольшую выгоду. Для уникальных товаров и услуг продавцы найдут больше потенциальных клиентов и могут взимать более высокие цены. Чем больше клиентов принимают веб-стиль жизни, тем ближе экономика будет двигаться к идеальному рынку Адама Смита во всех областях торговли.\n\nТеперь клиенты могут напрямую обращаться к производителям и поставщикам услуг, поэтому простая передача товаров или информации приносит мало пользы. Разные люди предсказывали \"смерть посредника\". Конечно, ценность некоторых видов посредников быстро падает до нуля. Турагенты, которые просто бронируют авиабилеты, исчезнут. Этот вид крупномасштабной, малоценной сделки идеально подходит для сайта путешествий в интернете с самообслуживанием. В будущем турагентам придется делать больше, чем просто заказывать билеты; им нужно будет создать полное приключение путешествия. Турагент, который предоставляет высоко персонализированные туры в Италию или калифорнийскую винодельческую страну, по-прежнему будет пользоваться большим спросом.\n\nЕсли вы являетесь посредником, интернет-обещание более дешевых цен и более быстрого обслуживания может положить конец вашей роли содействия контакту между производителем и потребителем. Если это происходит с вами, один из вариантов-использовать Интернет, чтобы вернуться в действие. Это то, что Egghead, крупная сеть магазинов программного обеспечения, сделала после нескольких лет борьбы. Egghead закрыл все свои физические магазины в 1998 году и начал продавать только в Интернете. Egghead теперь предлагает ряд новых онлайн-программ, которые используют преимущества Интернета, таких как электронные продажи примерно пятидесяти различных категорий оборудования и программного обеспечения, а также подержанных компьютеров. Пока неясно, удастся ли Яйцеголовому пройти тест, описанный в этой главе, который заключается в том, что посредник должен увеличивать стоимость, но компания, безусловно, понимает этот принцип.\n\nКаждый магазин должен учитывать интернет. Успех проекта Amazon.com книжный магазин, который существует только в интернете, заставил Barnes & Noble объединить свои успешные физические книжные магазины с сильным онлайн-присутствием и начать работать с Bertelsmann, ведущей международной медиа-компанией.\n\nДля сферы услуг Интернет требует, чтобы Вы были либо крупным, недорогим поставщиком, либо поставщиком высоко персонализированных услуг. Для модели с большим объемом и низкой стоимостью вы используете интернет-технологию для создания подхода самообслуживания. Вы делаете много информации доступной для клиентов, и вы управляете большим трафиком через ваш интернет-сайт, предлагая лучшую цену. Поскольку только несколько компаний на любом рынке будут крупными игроками, большинству компаний придется искать способы использования Интернета не только для снижения затрат, но и для предоставления новых услуг.\n\nЭлектронная торговля ценными бумагами начала предоставлять недорогие финансовые услуги в Интернете в 1992 году. К 1998 году по меньшей мере семьдесят компаний покупали и продавали акции для своих клиентов в интернете, и это число росло. Финансовые фирмы, которые все еще предлагают услугу лицом к лицу или по телефону, сталкиваются с проблемой: большая часть данных об акциях, которые эти компании предоставляют своим клиентам, доступна бесплатно в Интернете. Но если компании, которые не предлагают интернет-услуги, становятся электронными трейдерами( e-traders), что они могут сделать, что отличается от того, что уже предлагают клиентам?\n\nMerrill Lynch, ведущая на рынке финансовая компания, задавала себе именно этот вопрос, когда смотрела на то, как она вела бизнес в 1997 году. Клиенты инвестируют в Merrill Lynch уже более ста лет. Компания управляла своими акциями, получая большие объемы финансовых данных, анализируя их и составляя долгосрочные финансовые планы. К 1997 году клиенты вложили в Merrill Lynch более одного триллиона долларов. Но рост дешевой торговли, а затем интернет-торговли между 1992 и 1997 годами показал менеджерам, что компании придется меняться. Как сказал Говард Сорген из Merrill Lynch :\" наши клиенты менялись. Менялся способ получения информации и принятия решений. Было бы глупо думать, что нам тоже не придется меняться\".\n\nОсновными активами Merrill Lynch являются ее финансовые консультанты, люди, которые консультируют клиентов по поводу их инвестиций. Но в 1997 году они тратили много времени на поиск данных и недостаточно времени на консультирование клиентов по поводу их инвестиций. Информационные системы в то время были дорогими и трудными в использовании. Все различные категории данных-цены акций, информация о продукте, база данных клиентов, цены - находились в разных системах, и все они были несовместимы и трудны в использовании. Новая информационная система была построена вокруг финансовых консультантов. Это помогло им получить данные и разработать лучший финансовый план для клиента как можно быстрее. Чтобы сэкономить деньги и время на разработку, компания также хотела использовать существующие продукты, когда это было возможно.\n\nМенеджеры Merrill Lynch попросили у своего совета директоров миллиард долларов для инвестиций в новые технологии. Совет директоров согласился с тем, что лучший способ конкурировать - предоставить работникам умственного труда компании-финансовым консультантам-лучшие инструменты знаний. Таким образом, менеджеры получили разрешение на то, что стало пятилетним проектом стоимостью 825 миллионов долларов. Эта работа была завершена в срок в октябре 1998 года и обошлась почти в 825 миллионов долларов. Из этой суммы около 250 миллионов долларов ушло на разработку программного обеспечения. Большая часть оставшихся расходов - например, система получения цен на акции и рыночных новостей - потребовалась бы независимо от того, какое программное обеспечение использовала Merrill Lynch. Фактическая разница в стоимости составила около 250 миллионов долларов за четыре года. За чуть более 60 миллионов долларов в год, примерно 3500 долларов на одного финансового консультанта, Merrill Lynch улучшила информационную систему для 14 700 финансовых консультантов в своих 700 американских офисах и еще для 2000 консультантов на международном уровне.\n\nГлавный технический директор Говард Зорген показал мне решение Merrill Lynch. Все системы теперь полностью совместимы. Вся финансовая информация, из любого источника, организована в \"страницы\", а затем в\"книги\". Финансовый консультант может заглянуть в любую книгу-например, в котировки акций на бирже NASDAQ, в Нью-Йорке и Токио. Финансовый консультант может сразу увидеть, все ли акции клиента идут хорошо или плохо и почему. Раньше это занимало много времени, так как акции каждой компании рассматривались индивидуально. Теперь финансовый консультант может даже сразу увидеть, что произойдет, если одна партия акций будет куплена, а другая продана. Вскоре клиенты смогут увидеть эти расчеты на своих экранах ПК. Кроме того, система ведет себя как хорошо обученный помощник финансового контролера. Если у клиента контролера есть акции компании, система будет выводить фоновые данные о компании на экран без запроса, всякий раз, когда контролер запрашивает цену акций.\n\nПосле изменений в системе Merrill Lynch у финансовых консультантов появилось больше времени для построения более прочных отношений с клиентами. Затем Merrill Lynch решила, что предоставление клиентам большего количества информации сделает их отношения более прочными, а не более слабыми.\n\nMerrill Lynch Online - это версия системы Merrill Lynch для клиентов. Он дает клиенту некоторые исходные данные, на которых основываются решения, а также основную информацию о счете клиента в Merrill Lynch. Компания надеялась получить 200 000 клиентов в первый год, в среднем около 550 человек в день. Вместо этого от 700 до 800 человек в день выходили в интернет с помощью этой системы. Одним из сюрпризов стал возраст клиентов, которые первыми приняли систему. Merrill Lynch полагала, что молодые клиенты, выросшие с Интернетом, сначала попробуют эту систему, но первыми покупателями были более пожилые и богатые клиенты.\n\nПосле первого успеха Merrill Lynch добавила еще больше в онлайн-сервис. Сегодня клиенты могут отправлять электронные письма своим финансовым консультантам, просматривать последние цены акций, покупать и продавать акции. Merrill Lynch теперь видит в Интернете возможность, а не угрозу. Он дает клиенту информацию, но финансовая информация не является финансовым знанием. Это все еще обеспечивается финансовыми консультантами, у которых теперь есть больше времени, чтобы сосредоточиться на этом. И они предоставляют его хорошо информированным клиентам, которые задают лучшие вопросы, чем плохо информированные клиенты. Теперь цель состоит в том, чтобы клиент и финансовый консультант одновременно смотрели на одни и те же данные на экране. Затем, как любят говорить люди из Merrill Lynch,\"начинается настоящее волшебство\".\n\nВзаимодействовать со своими клиентами.\n\nПо мере роста электронной коммерции не только посредники будут находить творческие способы использования Интернета для укрепления своих отношений с клиентами. Компании, которые относятся к электронной коммерции как к чему-то большему, чем просто способ заработать легкие деньги, сделают это лучше всего. Конечно, продажи-это конечная цель, но сама продажа-это только одна часть онлайн-взаимодействия с клиентами. Некоторые компании будут использовать Интернет для взаимодействия со своими клиентами таким образом, который раньше был невозможен. Они сделают продажу частью серии услуг для клиентов, для которых Интернет обладает уникальными преимуществами.\n\nВажно, чтобы клиенты уходили от электронных взаимодействий достаточно довольными, чтобы рассказать об этом своим друзьям. Это самое мощное средство, с помощью которого любой продукт или компания строит репутацию, а интернет-это средство, созданное для легкого общения. Если клиенту не нравится товар или то, как с ним обошелся трейдер, он, скорее всего, отправит электронное письмо всем своим друзьям. Интернет-автомобильный сайт под названием Autoweb.com запрашивает клиентов о дилерском обслуживании по электронной почте и удаляет дилеров из своих списков, если они не улучшают свой сервис в результате жалоб.\n\nСегодня основной конкуренцией для интернет-магазинов являются физические магазины. Физические магазины имеют гораздо более высокие объемы продаж, чем интернет-магазины. Онлайн-продажи в 1998 году составляли всего 0,5% от общего объема продаж в семи крупнейших экономиках мира. Но в следующем десятилетии этот процент значительно возрастет. По мере развития электронной коммерции основной конкуренцией за интернет-сайты будут уже не физические магазины, а другие интернет-магазины.\n\nБыстро растущие категории онлайн-торговли включают финансы и страхование, путешествия и продажи компьютеров. Такие компании, как Cisco Systems, Dell Computer и Microsoft, в настоящее время делают миллиарды долларов каждый в бизнесе через Интернет каждый год. Chrysler ожидает, что ее 1,5-процентный объем онлайн-продаж подскочит до 25 процентов через четыре года. Даже самые осторожные оценки прогнозируют ежегодный рост онлайн-продаж примерно на 45 процентов. По самым высоким оценкам, к 2000 году объем бизнеса превысил 1,6 триллиона долларов. Я думаю, что это слишком низко.\n\nDell была одной из первых крупных компаний, которые перешли на электронную коммерцию. Компания поставляет компьютеры по всему миру, продавая продукцию на сумму более 18 миллиардов долларов. Компания начала продавать свою продукцию онлайн в середине 1996 года. Его онлайн-бизнес быстро вырос с $1 млн в неделю до $ 1 млн в день. Вскоре он подскочил до 3 миллионов долларов в день, а затем и до 5 миллионов. Он все еще растет. Покупателям компьютеров явно нравится и легко покупать свои компьютеры в Интернете. На момент написания этой статьи Dell посещает свой веб-сайт более 1,5 миллиона раз в неделю, и 11 процентов ее бизнеса находится в интернете. Dell надеялась, что этот показатель вырастет до 50%, возможно, уже в 2000 году.\n\nМайкл Делл, основавший компанию, верит в Прямые продажи и компьютерную коммерцию. Но он знает, что Интернет должен быть основной частью общей бизнес-стратегии. Весь бизнес Dell основан на онлайн-торговле и поддержке. Первый сайт Dell предоставлял информацию о продукте, позволял клиентам покупать онлайн и запрашивал идеи клиентов. Делл многому научился из поступавших предложений, в основном в интернете. Со временем Dell внесла сотни изменений в свой веб-сайт. Клиенты могут делать все больше и больше онлайн. Теперь они могут видеть онлайн прогресс продукта, который они заказали.\n\n\"Интернет не заменяет людей. Это делает их более эффективными\", - говорит Майкл Делл. \"Мы должны были построить интернет-систему, которая была бы настолько удобна, что клиенты получали больше пользы за свое время, чем по телефону\".\n\nНаличие дополнительной информации в интернете для клиентов не уменьшило ценность отдела продаж Dell. Как и Merrill Lynch, Dell обнаружила, что образованный клиент-лучший клиент. Отдел продаж Dell стал больше похож на консультантов для клиента. И у них есть больше времени для консультаций, потому что покупка и продажа онлайн намного быстрее.\n\nОдним из уникальных подходов Dell к поддержке клиентов было создание более 5000 индивидуально разработанных страниц для своих крупных клиентов. Около 65 процентов онлайн-бизнеса Dell приходится на частных лиц и малый бизнес, и главные страницы-это один из способов развития корпоративного бизнеса Dell. Они делают крупные покупки в интернете проще и быстрее.\n\nТолько информационные технологии (ИТ) могут уравновесить потребность в достаточном количестве запасов для быстрого снабжения клиентов с затратами на хранение слишком большого количества запасов. Идеальная информация о том, что нужно клиенту, - это ответ на потребность в нулевом запасе, ожидающем заказа.\n\nMarriott International, крупнейшая в мире Гостиничная компания, зарабатывает более 10 миллиардов долларов на своих 1500 отелях по всему миру под десятью различными брендами. Отели имеют систему онлайн-бронирования с 1996 года, и хотя Marriott говорит, что эта система была простой и всего лишь экспериментом, к концу года она принесла бизнесу 1 миллион долларов.\n\nМарриотт увидел, что Интернет может сделать еще больше, и в начале 1997 года они создали специальную интернет-команду. С самого начала технологическая команда тесно сотрудничала с бизнес-командой. Исследования показали, что одним из предметов, о которых люди больше всего хотели получить информацию, были путешествия. \"Интернет - это сервис, - говорит Майк Пусатери из Marriott, - предоставляющий клиентам услуги быстрее, дружелюбнее и более личные, чем они или компания когда-либо испытывали раньше. А обслуживание-это бизнес Марриотта\".\n\nMarriott была одной из первых компаний, создавших интерактивную домашнюю страницу на своем веб-сайте. Вы можете найти отель Marriott в интернете, запросив отели в определенном городе, отели с определенными удобствами и отели с определенными функциями в своих номерах. Связанные страницы показывают достопримечательности рядом с отелем, например поле для гольфа. Или, если вы хотите пойти в китайский ресторан, система перечислит шесть ближайших. Когда вы выберете свой отель, вы сможете узнать о ценах и забронировать номер. Есть также ссылки на другие сайты, которые бронируют номера, например TravelWeb.com и Microsoft Expedia.com. Сайт Marriott содержит ссылки на 1000 других веб-страниц.\n\nПоскольку каждый посетитель ищет именно то, что он или она хочет на веб-сайте Marriott, у каждого посетителя есть свой опыт. Веб-сайт посещают 15 000 человек в день, что принесло более 2 миллионов долларов в месяц из интернет-источников в 1997 году. Марриотту трудно сказать, какой процент от этой прибыли был бы получен в любом случае традиционными методами, но ясно, что интернет привлекает более богатых клиентов, которые предпочитают его более дорогие отели. В среднем онлайн-клиент тратит в Marriott больше, чем средний клиент.\n\nМарриотт обнаружил, как и другие, что чем более интерактивным является сайт, тем больше деловой активности он получает от своих посетителей. Например, вместо поэтажных планов будущие клиенты видят виртуальные фотографии отеля. Вскоре клиенты смогут ввести место, где они хотят остановиться, и названия других отелей Marriott, в которых они останавливались. Затем сайт предоставит им ближайший отель Marriott, похожий на тот, которым они пользовались раньше.\n\nМарриотт не вырезает посредников, он делает их частью своего обслуживания клиентов. Компания предоставляет специальные места на своем сайте для турагентов и организаторов встреч. Тысячи планировщиков встреч просматривают сайт Marriott, потому что им не нужно посещать отель, прежде чем они примут решение о том, где провести свою встречу.\n\nПримите веб-образ жизни.\n\nЕсли бы вы спросили своих друзей, почему они используют телефон для общения со своими друзьями или почему они обращаются к телевизору для развлечения или последних новостей, они посмотрели бы на вас странным образом. Если бы вы спросили своих друзей, приняли ли они \"электрический образ жизни\", они бы подумали, что вы сошли с ума.\n\nЛюди в развитых странах мало думают о своих электрических продуктах, мы просто используем их. Но люди, которым сейчас за пятьдесят, помнят времена, когда телевизоры были только в нескольких семьях. Наши бабушки и дедушки помнят времена, когда большая часть сельской Америки была без электричества. Потребовалось более ста лет, чтобы электрический образ жизни произвел революцию в цивилизации.\n\nКогда улицы и дома были впервые подключены, электричество использовалось только для освещения. Способность электричества изменить образ жизни каждого была скрыта. Электрический свет был чище, безопаснее, ярче и удобнее, чем природный газ, масло или свечи. Однако, когда была создана инфраструктура, появились новые продукты, которые использовали преимущества электричества. Электрические холодильники, проигрыватели пластинок и кондиционеры применяли новую технологию к существующим потребностям. Самыми революционными видами использования электричества были телефон, радио и телевизор. Эти новые машины изменили нашу экономику и наш образ жизни. Люди и не мечтали об этих продуктах до того, как появилась инфраструктура.\n\nПоскольку интернет - это коммуникационная инфраструктура, которая зависит от электричества, можно сказать, что его популярное признание является продолжением образа жизни электричества. Но интернет создает новый образ жизни, который я называю \"веб-стилем жизни\". Веб-образ жизни, как и образ жизни электричества, будет характеризоваться тем, что новые вещи происходят быстро. Инфраструктура высокоскоростных коммуникаций создает новое программное и аппаратное обеспечение, которое изменит жизнь людей.\n\nИнтеллектуальные машины, такие как ПК, становятся все более мощными и менее дорогими. Поскольку они программируются, их можно использовать для многих различных задач. Через десять лет большинство американцев и многие другие люди во всем мире будут жить в Интернете. Для этих людей будет естественно обратиться к Интернету, чтобы получать новости, учиться, развлекаться и общаться. Это будет так же нормально, как поднять трубку телефона, чтобы поговорить с кем-то или заказать что-то. Интернет будет использоваться для оплаты ваших счетов, управления финансами, общения с вашим врачом и ведения любого бизнеса. Так же естественно, что вы будете носить с собой одну или несколько небольших машин, использующих радиосвязь, чтобы постоянно оставаться на связи и заниматься электронными делами, где бы вы ни находились.\n\nДля многих людей веб-стиль жизни сегодня очень близок. К 1998 году более шестидесяти миллионов американцев регулярно пользовались интернетом, по сравнению с двадцатью двумя миллионами годом ранее. К 1998 году средний пользователь заходил в интернет восемь-девять раз в месяц, проводя в общей сложности около трех с половиной часов в месяц в интернете. Интересно видеть, что люди, живущие веб-образом жизни, используют Интернет, чтобы учиться и покупать по-новому. Когда летом 1997 года \"Странник\" приземлился на Марсе, сайт НАСА за четыре дня получил сорок семь миллионов просмотров от людей, которые искали больше подробностей, чем они могли получить от традиционных средств массовой информации.\n\nКомпании предоставляют широкий спектр информации и услуг, таких как котировки акций в режиме реального времени, спортивные результаты и путеводители по городу. В интернете можно купить практически все, от картин до старых игрушек. Интернет является идеальным средством для оказания помощи, чтобы тоже создать сообщество,. Есть сайты для отслеживания пропавших детей, для помощи людям в усыновлении домашних животных и для любого времяпрепровождения, которое вы можете себе представить. Сайты, в которых участвуют граждане, получают отличный трафик.\n\nКультурное изменение, столь же значительное, как переход к веб-образу жизни, будет в некоторой степени зависеть от возраста пользователей. Дети, растущие с новой технологией, покажут нам все возможности. Широко распространены персональные компьютеры, высокоскоростные сети и интернет-коммуникации. Университеты избавляются от бумажных бланков и регистрируют студентов на занятия через Интернет. Студенты могут посмотреть свои оценки и даже отправить работу через Интернет. Учителя проводят онлайн-дискуссионные группы. Студенты пишут друзьям и родственникам по электронной почте так же естественно, как и звонят им по телефону.\n\nВнедрение технологий для веб-образа жизни происходит быстрее, чем внедрение электричества, автомобилей, телевидения и радио. Многие люди, которые используют ПК в офисе, устанавливают их дома для работы, а затем используют их для гораздо большего. Многие люди старше пятидесяти пяти лет, которые обычно не добавляют новые технологии в свой образ жизни, хотят использовать Интернет как способ оставаться на связи со своими друзьями и семьями. Революционно новое использование Интернета, которое никто из нас не может точно предсказать сегодня, изменит мир так же полностью в двадцать первом веке, как неожиданное использование электричества в двадцатом-и быстрее.\n\nПоскольку люди быстро перемещаются в интернете, одним из самых основных изменений будет степень, в которой клиенты будут управлять своими финансами в интернете. В 1998 году только около миллиона из пятнадцати миллиардов счетов в Соединенных Штатах были оплачены электронным способом. Онлайн-обслуживание клиентов было мало доступно. На самом деле, хотя клиенты могут оплачивать некоторые счета онлайн, почти в каждом случае они все равно получают их на бумаге. По оценкам Министерства торговли США, когда клиенты смогут платить онлайн, затраты на обработку данных снизятся более чем на 20 миллиардов долларов в год. Сегодня вы должны рассчитать на бумаге, какие счета вы хотите оплатить и сколько вы хотите заплатить по каждому. В будущем программное обеспечение позволит вам в режиме онлайн рассчитать влияние различных платежей на ваш банковский баланс. Вы сделаете свой платеж точно в срок. А программное обеспечение для оплаты счетов будет взаимодействовать с программным обеспечением для управления финансами.\n\nК концу 1998 года около половины всех американских домов имели компьютеры, и около половины из них были подключены к интернету. В большинстве других стран этот процент ниже. Снижение стоимости высокоскоростных коммуникаций, чтобы люди могли постоянно оставаться на связи, и упрощение использования программного обеспечения имеют важное значение для распространения веб-образа жизни. Я считаю, что к 2001 году более 60 процентов американских домов будут иметь компьютеры, и что 85 процентов этих домов будут подключены к интернету. Для того чтобы другие страны достигли такого уровня использования, им придется вложить значительные средства в инфраструктуру связи.\n\nЛюди не понимают, насколько улучшится аппаратное и программное обеспечение. Возьмем только один пример: экранная технология. Я пишу электронную почту на пятидесятисантиметровом плоском экране. Он пока не доступен по разумной цене, но через два-три года будет доступен. Через пять лет стосантиметровый плоский экран станет доступным. Качество экрана будет иметь большое влияние на то, как много люди будут читать на экране, а не на бумаге.\n\nСтоимость персонального компьютера также снижается. Исторически индустрия ПК концентрировалась на создании более мощных ПК по определенной цене. Теперь авансы снижают и цены. Способные ПК сегодня стоят гораздо меньше 1000 долларов, а более низкие цены расширяют рынок. Глядя на десятилетний период времени, вы будете иметь компьютеры, которые стоят столько же, сколько обычный телевизор. На самом деле разница между телевизором и ПК будет невелика, потому что даже коробки, которые подключают телевизоры к кабельной системе, будут иметь процессор более мощный, чем тот, который мы имеем сегодня в самом дорогом ПК.\n\nБолее мелкие личные компаньоны станут обычными. Они будут включать в себя небольшие компьютеры, представленные сегодня на рынке, и новые компьютеры размером с кошелек, которые позволят осуществлять электронные операции. Телефон, радио и телевидение приобретут новые возможности по мере перехода на цифровые технологии. Некоторые машины будут с вами. Некоторые из них будут находиться в разных комнатах вашего дома. Другие станут стандартными в транспортных средствах.\n\nЛюбой из них позволит вам пользоваться электронной и голосовой почтой, получать информацию из биржевых сводок или других новостей, а также узнавать последние новости о погоде и вашем рейсе. Эти машины будут подключаться через провода или через технологии, которые не используют провода, такие как радио. Хотя машины будут работать независимо, они будут обмениваться данными между собой автоматически.\n\nЭти машины станут частью обычной жизни. Когда вы выходите из офиса на целый день, ваш персональный цифровой компаньон загружает вашу электронную почту, которая может включать список покупок от вашего мужа или жены. В магазине вы можете скачать новый рецепт, и все предметы для еды будут добавлены в ваш список. Ваш цифровой компаньон достаточно умен, чтобы говорить со всеми машинами, которые должны знать ваш домашний или рабочий график, но только говорит кухонным машинам о рецепте. С компьютера на кухне вы проверяете дом. На видеозаписи у входной двери видно, кто звонил, когда никого не было дома.\n\nЦифровые камеры безопасности, подключенные к сети, становятся все дешевле и станут обычным явлением для снижения краж. Некоторые школы предоставляют камеры, чтобы родители могли следить за своими детьми, пока они в школе.\n\nПока готовится ужин, вы заходите на личный сайт вашей большой семьи и обнаруживаете, что все в чате обсуждают, что делать, когда семья соберется. Они использовали электронное голосование, чтобы выбрать полдюжины возможных событий, и они попросили вас забронировать как можно больше из них. Программный агент, который знает, что вы уже забронировали поездку, предлагает несколько вещей, которые можно сделать на месте, включая Парусный спорт, который был в списке вашей семьи. Агент также сообщает вам о новом, более низком тарифе на перелет до места назначения. Вы в цифровом виде заказываете Парусный спорт и более низкие тарифы.\n\nКогда вы будете готовы смотреть телевизор, вы можете посмотреть электронное руководство по программированию на экране или использовать другой программный агент, чтобы узнать, что происходит. Вы рассказали агенту о своих вкусах просмотра, и он отследил ваши фактические модели просмотра, поэтому он рекомендует несколько шоу из сотен доступных на цифровом телевидении. Вы решили посмотреть футбольный матч. Во время просмотра вы используете интерактивное меню, чтобы принять участие в конкурсе и проголосовать за самого ценного игрока. Зрительские баллы будут засчитываться за половину конечного результата. Вы смотрите рекламу автомобиля. Большинство зрителей видят рекламу грузовика, но данные, которые вы добровольно предоставили по телевизору, указывают на то, что вы лучше подходите для семейного автомобиля.\n\nРазвитие интеллектуального, интерактивного телевидения будет происходить по мере перехода телевидения к цифровым технологиям. Цифровые трансляции легко исправляются на ошибки и позволяют получать высококачественное видео и звук. Однако цифровое телевидение может сделать гораздо больше, чем просто улучшить качество вещания. Спутниковые и кабельные компании уже используют цифровое телевидение для доставки большего количества каналов. Со временем самый большой эффект цифрового телевидения будет заключаться в возможности включать другие цифровые данные, обеспечивая интерактивность, интеллектуальное программное обеспечение, целевую рекламу и коммерческие предложения, а также интернет.\n\nВещатели будут предоставлять больший контент, такой как ссылки на соответствующие веб-сайты или совершенно новый веб-контент, который добавляет к трансляции, или музыку, или программное обеспечение, которое можно загрузить за плату. Многие из новых функций требуют двусторонней связи, что легко для новых систем кабельного телевидения. Новая технология упростит интерфейс телевизора. Попытка записать одну или несколько программ в определенное время и в определенные дни остается раздражающе сложной. В будущем записать на пленку шоу будет так же просто, как сказать телевизору, что именно вы хотите записать. Использование речи для взаимодействия с телевизором, компьютером или другими личными компаньонами станет обычным явлением в течение десяти лет.\n\nПропускная способность, пропускная способность цифровой коммуникационной системы, остается самым большим препятствием для широкого внедрения веб-образа жизни во всех странах. Пропускная способность также является самой большой стоимостью. В развитых странах компании обычно могут позволить себе пропускную способность, необходимую для работы в цифровом формате, потому что многие коммуникационные компании подключают деловые районы. Но потребуется гораздо больше времени, чтобы получить доступную проводку в дома, школы и библиотеки, что имеет решающее значение для достижения полностью подключенного общества. Мы увидим преимущества веб-образа жизни только тогда, когда будут созданы системы с высокой пропускной способностью. Наиболее важным шагом для страны по созданию инфраструктуры с высокой пропускной способностью является стимулирование конкуренции в отрасли связи.\n\nУченые всего мира исследуют новые коммуникационные технологии - и старые. Недавно один британский инженер разработал способ передачи высокоскоростных голосовых и информационных сигналов на обычном электрическом токе, что повысило вероятность того, что интернет-сервис однажды сможет проникнуть в ваш дом по существующей инфраструктуре электрических проводов. Эта и другие технологии, такие как спутниковое вещание, являются захватывающими, потому что они не требуют от нас замены существующей проводки, которая уже соединяет большинство домов в развитых странах. Создание веб-инфраструктуры по всему миру-это огромная задача, но прогресс во многих областях делает вероятным, что скорость улучшения удивит всех в следующем десятилетии.\n\nСоциальные последствия веб-образа жизни будут огромны. Многие люди боятся, что компьютеры и интернет сделают жизнь менее личной, создав менее теплый и дружелюбный мир. Некоторые люди поначалу опасались, что телефон тоже сократит контакт лицом к лицу. Два человека могут звонить друг другу, когда они разговаривали бы лицом к лицу без телефона, и два человека могут писать друг другу по электронной почте, когда они встретились бы лицом к лицу без электронной почты.\n\nЛюбой носитель может быть плохо использован. Развитие личных и профессиональных манер для интернета будет продолжаться. Достаточно легко сказать, что веб-образ жизни, в котором каждый живет в своем маленьком мире, приведет к тому, что общество развалится. Я считаю, что на самом деле все наоборот. Точно так же, как телефон и электронная почта увеличили контакт между людьми, живущими в разных сообществах, компьютер и интернет дают нам другой способ общения. Они ничего не забирают.\n\nНа самом деле возможность использовать Интернет для перемещения или изменения границ наших сообществ укрепляет личные и культурные связи. В Амстердаме, в Нидерландах, проходят интернет-дискуссии по таким вопросам, как городское планирование, безопасность и наркотики. Граждане могут связаться с полицией по электронной почте. Египетский сайт для детей под названием \"Маленький гор\" содержит более 300 страниц информации и фотографий, охватывающих 7000-летнюю цивилизацию Египта. Он также содержит информацию о сегодняшнем Египте, включая его экономическую, культурную и социальную жизнь. В разделе \" тур \" представлены советы по популярным направлениям для детей.\n\nВеб-стиль жизни-это расширение горизонтов, а не их сужение. Создание сообществ станет одной из самых больших областей роста в ближайшие несколько лет в Интернете. Сеть резко увеличивает количество сообществ, к которым вы можете присоединиться.\n\nВ прошлом у вас, возможно, было время, чтобы быть частью вашего соседского сообщества и одной или двух общественных организаций. В веб-образе жизни вы ограничены только своими интересами.\n\nОдним из самых мощных эффектов Интернета является то, как он может соединять группы людей независимо от географии или часовых поясов. Если вы хотите собрать группу увлеченных игроков в карты или поговорить о проблемах с людьми, которые разделяют ваши политические взгляды, Интернет делает это легко. Если вы хотите следить за тем, что происходит в вашем родном городе, Интернет может помочь.\n\nКак мы собираемся найти время, чтобы вести веб-образ жизни и присоединяться к большему количеству сообществ? Сеть сделает вещи более эффективными, чем они были раньше. Вы можете быстро узнать, сколько стоит ваш подержанный автомобиль, спланировать поездку или узнать все, что вам нужно знать, когда вы хотите сделать крупную покупку. Сегодня в интернете все это очень просто. И люди, вероятно, обменяют часть времени, которое они сейчас проводят за чтением газет или просмотром телевизора, на информацию или развлечения, которые они найдут в Интернете. Британское исследование 1998 года показало, что около 25% взрослых британцев, пользующихся Интернетом, смотрят телевизор меньше, чем раньше.\n\nБольшая часть этой книги посвящена тому, чтобы иметь всю необходимую информацию на кончиках пальцев. Большинство людей хотят найти лучшую цену на продукт или быть в курсе важных вопросов, затрагивающих их местные или национальные сообщества. Мы обошлись без этой информации, потому что получить ее было просто слишком сложно. Веб-стиль жизни не связан с изменением человеческой природы или основ того, как люди живут. Вместо этого веб-стиль жизни дает большему количеству людей возможность лучше преследовать свои интересы.\n\nВеб-стиль жизни изменит то, как люди делают покупки. Поскольку интернет - это самая большая в мире коллекция торговых центров, у клиентов будет выбор, которого у них раньше не было. Они смогут найти все варианты товаров, которые они хотят, и, во многих случаях, сделать их специально. Они могут получить конечный продукт, доставленный прямо к их дверям. Поскольку клиенты требуют более быстрого и личного обслуживания и более прочных отношений, веб-стиль жизни будет побуждать компании развивать цифровую нервную систему, чтобы оставаться со своими конкурентами.\n\nСеть по-новому соединяет работников, друзей и семьи. Сообщества, основанные на общих интересах, формируются с членами со всего мира. Правительства имеют возможность привлекать граждан больше, чем когда-либо прежде. Позволяя людям делать покупки, получать новости, встречаться друг с другом, развлекаться и сплетничать так, как мы только сейчас начинаем понимать, Интернет становится городской площадью для деревни, которой мир станет завтра.\n\nС помощью веб-образа жизни люди могут преодолеть многие барьеры, которые существовали так долго, что мы почти принимаем их как должное. Веб-стиль жизни-это не усложнение и без того напряженной жизни. По мере того, как люди привыкают к веб-образу жизни, они в конечном итоге принимают его бездумно, точно так же, как они делают электрический образ жизни, который они живут сегодня.\n\nИзменение границ бизнеса\n\nПоток цифровой информации меняет способ работы людей, организаций и предприятий. Интернет-технологии также изменят границы организаций всех размеров. При изменении границ \"веб-стиль работы\" с использованием цифровых инструментов и процессов позволяет как организациям, так и отдельным лицам менять свои роли. Корпорация может использовать Интернет для бесперебойной работы с профессионалами, такими как юристы и бухгалтеры, которые остаются \"вне\" стен компании. Важный принцип реинжиниринга заключается в том, что компании должны сосредоточиться на своих базовых навыках и передать все остальное на аутсорсинг. Интернет позволяет компании делать это в большей степени, чем когда-либо прежде, изменяя, какие сотрудники работают внутри стен, а какие-снаружи в другой роли.\n\nНаши основные навыки в Microsoft - это создание объемных программных продуктов, работа с другими компаниями-разработчиками программного обеспечения, а также обслуживание и поддержка клиентов. Мы передаем на аутсорсинг ряд функций, которые не подпадают под эти категории, от технической поддержки наших сотрудников до физического производства наших программных пакетов. Веб-стиль работы позволяет лучше справляться с непредсказуемым спросом. Поскольку у вас есть большая потребность в навыке, а затем вы его не получаете, для некоторых областей вы хотите иметь возможность нанять персонал на короткое время, чтобы иметь дело с вершинами и долинами. Интернет означает, что все больше компаний могут использовать \"студийный\" подход к управлению основными частями своего бизнеса. У крупных голливудских студий есть штатные сотрудники, которые занимаются финансами, маркетингом и другими непрерывными проектами, но творческая сторона бизнеса, штатный персонал кинопроизводства, вообще не очень велик. Когда концепция фильма согласована, режиссер собирает большую группу людей для создания фильма. Закончив, они переходят к другим проектам.\n\nВеб-технология позволяет структурировать множество различных видов проектов в виде студийных работ. Владелец проекта, который хочет нанять команду, может выйти в интернет, описать проект и узнать, кто доступен. Люди и организации с нужными навыками могут заявить о своей заинтересованности, и владелец проекта может быстро создать команду. Люди, ищущие работу, найдут больше возможностей для трудоустройства, отвечающего их конкретным интересам и потребностям-например, если у них есть узкоспециализированные навыки или если они хотят работать только определенные часы.\n\nНесмотря на эти изменения, крупные фирмы не будут разбиваться на отдельные производственные компании. Крупные компании будут продолжать балансировать нагрузку на свою работу, как и всегда, - они просто будут использовать технологии, чтобы делать это более эффективно. Каждая компания будет экспериментировать, чтобы найти свой наиболее эффективный размер и организационную структуру, хотя тенденция будет в сторону небольших компаний. Средние и малые компании могут воспользоваться изменяющимися границами возможностей Интернета, чтобы действовать намного больше, чем они есть, без добавления сотрудников или офисов. Небольшая компания с нужными навыками может участвовать в торгах и руководить производством фильмов, строительством или рекламным проектом. Быстро объединившись с другими компаниями и профессионалами, она может действовать как виртуальная крупная компания, чтобы работать над проектом до его прибыльного завершения. Поскольку команда может быть распущена в конце проекта, компания может управлять трудовыми ресурсами без административной нагрузки большого штатного персонала.\n\nНекоторые сотрудники в компаниях любого размера, естественно, нервничают из-за влияния веб-стиля работы. Они предполагают, что если их компания решит строить себя на основе веб-технологий, их рабочие места могут исчезнуть. Они не будут - если только \"реструктуризация\" не является просто причудливым термином, чтобы скрыть увольнения. Когда компания сокращается, рабочие места теряются. Когда компания отдает работу на аутсорсинг, рабочие места перемещаются. Цель не в том, чтобы избавиться от работы, а в том, чтобы переложить ответственность на специалистов извне. Для многих компаний, в том числе и для Microsoft, гораздо эффективнее иметь внешнюю компанию, которая занимается установкой и поддержкой небольших компьютеров, например, потому что компании, специализирующиеся на такой работе, могут развивать лучшие в мире навыки и потому что мы можем запросить конкурентные предложения для этой работы.\n\nСотрудники, которые реагируют на возможность аутсорсинга со страхом, предполагают, что работа принадлежит \"внутри\" компании, а не \"вне\". По мере того как компании меняются, у некоторых людей возникают трудности. Несмотря на понятную тревогу, сотрудники также должны смотреть на изменения как на возможность определить свою работу так, как они хотят, и работать в организации того размера и личности, которые они предпочитают. Они могут даже использовать эту революцию как шанс начать свой собственный бизнес. Не так давно один человек, который был писателем, наблюдал за тем, как Microsoft отдает свою писательскую работу на аутсорсинг,и увидел возможность. Сегодня этот человек прекрасно справляется с десятком или более писателей, и сотрудники Microsoft тратят свое время на определение работы, которую нужно сделать, вместо того чтобы пытаться управлять процессом написания для группы разных людей. В целом изменения в организационной структуре пойдут на пользу хорошим сотрудникам.\n\nВеб-стиль работы особенно хорошо подходит юристам, врачам, бухгалтерам и инженерам, которые обычно работают независимо или в небольших командах. Одна из причин, по которой профессионалы традиционно объединяются в фирмы, заключается в том, чтобы иметь дело с ростом и падением потребительского спроса. Теперь вместо того, чтобы объединиться, чтобы убедиться, что рабочая нагрузка распределена, они также будут иметь возможность работать самостоятельно и использовать Интернет для поиска клиентов.\n\nНе каждый выберет такой подход. Многие хотят работать в крупных фирмах. Им нравится идея принадлежать к одной компании, работать над долгосрочными проектами и быть частью сообщества и культуры конкретного рабочего места. Они инвестируют в свою карьеру, и компания инвестирует в них. Многие из самых интересных работ, таких как разработка программного обеспечения в моей компании, являются центральными областями, которые не будут переданы на аутсорсинг. Большинство компаний, в том числе Microsoft, упорно работают над тем, чтобы хорошие сотрудники оставались привлекательными в долгосрочной перспективе. Разработчики присоединяются к Microsoft, потому что видят возможность разрабатывать программное обеспечение или технологии, которые будут использоваться миллионами людей. Как и многие художники, они хотят, чтобы их работы охватили как можно большую аудиторию.\n\nЛюди, которые хотят работать в большой компании, будут работать на нее, а те, кто не хочет, будут иметь интересные альтернативы. Веб-стиль работы также облегчает работу людям, которые имеют хорошие навыки, но не могут или не хотят работать полный рабочий день. Поскольку они могут найти больше работы через Интернет и делать больше работы из дома, у этих людей появятся новые возможности. Общество выиграет, если будет лучше использовать этот огромный резерв талантов.\n\nКак бизнес-менеджер, вы должны внимательно изучить свои базовые навыки. Посмотрите еще раз на те области вашей компании, которые непосредственно не вовлечены в эту работу, и подумайте, могут ли веб-технологии позволить вам передать эти задачи на аутсорсинг. Пусть другая компания возьмет на себя ответственность за управление этой работой и использует современные коммуникационные технологии для тесной работы с людьми - теперь партнерами, а не сотрудниками,-выполняющими эту работу. Кроме того, подумайте о сотрудниках, которые имеют хорошие навыки и опыт, но решают, что они не хотят работать полный рабочий день. Лучшие средства коммуникации могут позволить вам продолжать использовать этих людей. В ближайшие годы конкуренция за найм лучших сотрудников будет только возрастать. Компании, которые предоставляют дополнительную свободу своим сотрудникам, будут иметь преимущество в этой ключевой области.\n\nСначала доберитесь до рынка\n\nПокупателям нужны качественные продукты по низким ценам, и они хотят их сейчас. Каждый бизнес, будь то производитель товаров и услуг или поставщик этого производителя, должен быстро реагировать, сохраняя высокое качество и низкую цену. Информационные технологии стали одним из основных факторов, способствующих более быстрому реагированию, более высокому качеству и более низкому росту цен, которые определили бизнес в последнее десятилетие.\n\nНемногие отрасли промышленности иллюстрируют два основных давления сокращения времени и улучшения качества лучше, чем автомобильная промышленность. Японские модели автомобилей в 1980-х годах выглядели более свежими, а их качество улучшалось чаще, чем в американских автомобилях, потому что японские автопроизводители могли перевести автомобиль из концепции в массовое производство за три года. Американским автопроизводителям обычно требовалось от четырех до шести лет, и их затраты были выше.\n\nАмериканские компании отреагировали на это, разрушив организационные барьеры, отделявшие отделы проектирования, производства и продаж друг от друга. Они также улучшили связь со своими внешними партнерами. Дизайнеры, инженеры, поставщики и производственный персонал начали работать в тесных командах, которые общались в электронном виде, сокращая время от разработки продукта до торгового зала наполовину.\n\nДругим технологическим усовершенствованиям в автомобильной промышленности значительно помогли технологии, в том числе автоматизированное проектирование (САПР) автомобилей. Возможности 3D-моделирования программ САПР позволяют инженерам проектировать транспортное средство без необходимости сначала создавать модель вручную. Проектировщики могут видеть, будут ли детали подходить друг к другу, и могут изменять конструкцию деталей без создания специальных инструментов. Электронные связи между производителями автомобилей и поставщиками уже снизили частоту ошибок в поставляемых деталях на 72 процента и сэкономили до восьми часов в неделю на каждый автомобиль в затратах на рабочую силу.\n\nКлиенты выигрывали от более качественных автомобилей, производимых быстрее. Достижения Ford в производстве являются репрезентативными для всей автомобильной промышленности. В 1990 году компании потребовалось пять или более лет, чтобы довести автомобиль от концепции до клиента, и она испытала 150 неисправностей на каждые 100 автомобилей, или 1,5 неисправности на автомобиль. К 1998 году Ford сократил время своего цикла более чем наполовину, до менее чем двадцати четырех месяцев. Уровень неисправностей снизился со 150 до 81 неисправности на 100 автомобилей.\n\nВ некоторых отраслях проблема быстро выходит на рынок, когда изменения становятся все более сложными. Intel, например, всегда имела девяностодневный производственный цикл для своих чипов, которые питают большинство ПК. Intel рассчитывает сохранить этот девяностодневный темп производства, хотя процессор становится все более и более сложным. Количество транзисторов в чипе увеличилось с 29 000 в чипе 8086 до 7,5 миллионов в Pentium в 1998 году, а то, на что способен процессор, выросло на 10 000 за те же двадцать лет. К 2011 году Intel планирует поставить чипы с одним миллиардом транзисторов. Закон Мура гласит, что мощность чипов удваивается каждые восемнадцать-двадцать четыре месяца. Если бы машины и хлопья шли одним и тем же путем, то по закону Мура машина стоила бы двадцать семь долларов, а коробка хлопьев-Пенни.\n\nIntel использует различные методы управления, производства и цифровые методы для поддержания эффективности, помещая все больше и больше транзисторов на чип размером с миниатюру. Каждый раз, когда меняется производственный процесс, строятся новые заводы, стоимость каждого из которых превышает миллиард долларов.\n\nВ 1998 году Intel внедрила стратегию \"точной копии\", чтобы поддерживать одинаковый уровень эффективности и качества на всех своих заводах по производству чипов. Программа под названием D2000 позаботилась о том, чтобы каждый инженер-проектировщик получил преимущества передового опыта всей организации. Intel обнаружила, что более 60 процентов проблем, с которыми столкнулись дизайнеры, уже были решены другой командой разработчиков. Очень вероятно, что любая крупная компания, использующая ручные процессы, найдет такое же количество повторной работы. D2000 помог Intel почти удвоить скорость производства новых продуктов с 1994 года, и он помог Intel достичь своей цели массового производства с первого дизайна чипа, не проходя через несколько версий дизайна, чтобы получить его правильно.\n\nХотя банки всегда были крупными пользователями информационных технологий, у них не было репутации быстрого выхода на рынок с новыми продуктами или услугами, за исключением Banco Bradesco, крупнейшего банка Бразилии. Имея почти 2200 филиалов и двадцать миллионов клиентов, Banco Bradesco имеет активы в размере 68,7 миллиарда долларов и обслуживает три миллиона человек в день. Это был первый бразильский банк, который использовал компьютеры в 1962 году, и это был первый банк, который предложил автоматизированные банкоматы в 1982 году. Banco Bradesco использует технологии, чтобы оставаться впереди конкурентов. Даже шесть месяцев-это слишком долго, чтобы вывести идею на рынок; обычный цикл развития составляет недели или, самое большее, несколько месяцев. Банк также стремится одновременно донести новый продукт или услугу до всей своей клиентской базы.\n\nДля одного клиента из малого бизнеса компания Bradesco разработала программное обеспечение, помогающее вкладывать деньги в бизнес и выводить их из него. Сейчас этой программой пользуются около 4100 предприятий. Для другого клиента Bradesco разработала зарплатную карту, которую сотрудники могли использовать в банкомате Bradesco, даже если у них не было счета в банке. В настоящее время эта карта используется примерно в 1300 компаниях и вскоре будет использоваться в 2000 компаниях с миллионом сотрудников. В каждом случае Брадеско был первым банком, предложившим эту услугу.\n\nВ 1996 году Banco Bradesco стал первым банком в Бразилии и только пятым в мире, который использовал Интернет для предоставления банковских услуг. К 1998 году число онлайн-клиентов росло на 12% в месяц. Интернет-банкинг в Бразилии более популярен, чем в любой другой стране. Веб-сайт банка BradescoNet предлагает полный спектр финансовых услуг. Будучи первым важным коммерческим интернет-сайтом в Бразилии, банк имеет возможность стать сайтом, через который бразильцы проходят, чтобы попасть на другие сайты. Какой лучший способ сохранить лояльность клиентов к вашей компании?\n\nНо банк признает, что в будущем ему необходимо еще лучше использовать свою цифровую нервную систему. Банк хочет собрать больше информации о каждом клиенте, чтобы продавать новые финансовые продукты, ориентированные на нужных людей. Например, если программа находит клиента, оплачивающего страхование автомобиля, банк может предложить кредит на покупку нового автомобиля, даже если клиент финансировал свой нынешний автомобиль в другом банке. Данные о клиентах - один из лучших активов банка. Брадеско потребуется несколько лет, чтобы собрать воедино всю имеющуюся у них информацию, но когда они это сделают, они смогут предложить гораздо больше финансовых услуг, ориентированных на нужных людей.\n\nВремя выхода на рынок в индустрии ПК прошло быстрее, чем где-либо еще. В этой ситуации лучший поток цифровой информации не просто улучшает компанию, он необходим для ее успеха.\n\nВсего за несколько лет производственный цикл компьютеров Compaq сократился с восемнадцати до двенадцати месяцев. К концу 1998 года он снизился до шести-девяти месяцев для бизнес-продуктов и до четырех месяцев для потребительских товаров. Но с более старыми информационными системами Compaq потребовалось сорок пять дней, чтобы собрать информацию о продажах по всему миру и свести ее к единому набору цифр, необходимых для планирования продукта. К тому времени, когда она сможет сообщить о своих производственных потребностях своим поставщикам, компания пройдет половину четырехмесячного жизненного цикла важных продуктов.\n\nCompaq запустила систему планирования корпоративных ресурсов (ERP). Все его заводы теперь используют одно и то же программное обеспечение, поэтому все данные, поступающие в ERP, совместимы. Сорокапятидневный цикл планирования теперь сократился до недели. Хотя недельные продажи необходимы для того, чтобы увидеть долгосрочные тенденции продаж, в будущем он будет иметь данные о продажах за день.\n\nCompaq также использует системы реального времени, которые помогают ей реагировать на незапланированные изменения спроса. Используя те же данные, которые поступают в ERP, Compaq хочет трижды за ночь, с интервалом в восемь часов, посмотреть на свои позиции по поставкам и заказам в США, Европе и Азии. Используя данные в режиме реального времени вместо данных недельной или даже дневной давности, Compaq хочет иметь возможность видеть и реагировать, например, на незапланированный заказ на 7000 ПК, а также работать с поставщиками, чтобы сразу увидеть, сможет ли компания доставить заказ вовремя.\n\nЧтобы иметь возможность двигаться как можно быстрее, компания Compaq перенесла все свои информационные системы в интернет. Система электронной коммерции означает, что, когда приходит заказ, поставщик видит это одновременно с планировщиком Compaq. Но все это должно быть сделано, пока производство еще продолжается. Джон Уайт, главный информационный директор Compaq в 1998 году, сказал, что это все равно что менять крылья и двигатель реактивного самолета, пока он еще летает.\n\nДругое программное решение: получаете ли вы все ERP-программное обеспечение от одной компании или получаете лучшее от множества разных компаний? Поскольку совместимость очень важна, большинство компаний обращаются к одной компании для удовлетворения всех своих потребностей в ERP. Но Microsoft заинтересована в том, чтобы ERP работала либо в разных версиях, либо с одним набором программного обеспечения. Решения Compaq-хороший пример того, как технологии и бизнес зависят друг от друга и помогают друг другу.\n\nЦифровые процессы позволяют каждой компании значительно сократить время выхода на рынок, хотя для доставки физических товаров всегда требуется определенное количество времени и энергии. Николас Негропонте из Массачусетского технологического института описывает разницу между физическими продуктами и информационными продуктами в цифровую эпоху как разницу между перемещением атомов (физические продукты, такие как автомобили и компьютеры) и перемещением битов (электронные продукты, такие как финансовый анализ и новостные передачи). Производители бит могут использовать Интернет, чтобы сократить время доставки почти до нуля. Производители атомов все еще не могут этого сделать, но они могут использовать битовую скорость-цифровую организацию всех видов-чтобы резко сократить время реакции. Почти все время, затрачиваемое на производство изделия, уходит на организацию работы, а не на само производство.\n\nХорошие информационные системы могут убрать большую часть этого времени ожидания. И производители физических продуктов обнаружат, что онлайн-сервис станет такой же частью их \"продукта\" и потребительского опыта, как и физические товары, которые они поставляют. Скорость доставки и взаимодействия с клиентом, ставшая возможной благодаря Интернету, эффективно превращает продукты в услуги. Продуктовые компании сегодня должны сравнивать себя не с лучшими из своих конкурентов, а с лучшими из всех сервисных компаний.\n\nВ конце концов, самый важный вопрос скорости для компаний-это культура. Это меняет то, что все предполагают о том, как быстро они должны двигаться. Все должны понимать, что если вы не удовлетворяете потребительский спрос достаточно быстро, не снижая качества, это сделает конкурент. Когда люди принимают необходимость действий, цифровые технологии позволяют быстро реагировать.\n\nГлава третья.\n\nУправление знаниями для улучшения.\n\nСтратегическое Мышление.\n\nПлохие новости должны распространяться быстро.\n\nУ меня есть природная способность находить плохие новости. Если он там, я хочу знать об этом. Люди, которые работают на меня, поняли это и держат меня в курсе.\n\nМногое идет не так в любой организации, даже в хорошей. Продукт выходит из строя. Вас удивляет клиент, который внезапно переключается на другую компанию. Конкурент выпускает продукт, который привлекает широкий новый рынок. Потеря доли рынка-это такая плохая новость, которую может понять каждая организация. Другие плохие новости могут касаться того, что происходит внутри компании. Может быть, продукт опоздает, или он не будет делать то, что вы ожидали, или вы не смогли нанять достаточно подходящих людей для выполнения ваших планов. Существенным качеством хорошего менеджера является желание искать плохие новости, а не отрицать их. Эффективный менеджер хочет услышать о том, что происходит не так, прежде чем он или она услышит о том, что происходит правильно. Вы не можете адекватно реагировать на неутешительные новости, если они не доходят до вас достаточно быстро.\n\nВы концентрируетесь на плохих новостях, чтобы быстро приступить к решению. Как только вы осознаете проблему, все в вашей организации должны начать действовать. Вы можете судить о компании по тому, как быстро она организует все свои мозговые силы, чтобы справиться с серьезной проблемой. Важным показателем цифровой нервной системы компании является то, как быстро люди в компании узнают о плохих новостях и реагируют на них. Цифровые технологии ускоряют время реагирования бизнеса в любой чрезвычайной ситуации.\n\nВ прежние времена реакция любой компании на плохие новости была медленной. Бизнес-лидеры часто узнавали о проблемах только после того, как они становились серьезными, поскольку единственным быстрым способом передать информацию было прервать их телефонным звонком. Прежде чем решить проблему, люди должны были найти информацию в бумажных файлах или спуститься в холл, чтобы найти кого-то, кто знал что-то о ситуации. Когда у людей была какая-то информация, они разговаривали по телефону или посылали друг другу бумаги. Каждый шаг в этом процессе занимал много времени. Сегодня, на заре информационной эры, мы можем отправлять информацию быстро, но даже сейчас большинство компаний не собирают ключевую информацию о проблемах клиентов в одном месте. Напротив, хорошо продуманная цифровая нервная система работает как система раннего предупреждения.\n\nИнтернет не всегда был главным приоритетом Microsoft. Его появление изменило наш бизнес и стало самым большим сюрпризом, на который нам когда-либо приходилось реагировать. Фактически, в 1995 году различные эксперты говорили, что интернет выведет Microsoft из бизнеса. Это были плохие новости в огромном масштабе. Мы использовали нашу цифровую нервную систему, чтобы отреагировать на этот кризис.\n\n24 августа 1995 года мы представили Windows 95, самый амбициозный программный продукт, когда-либо достигавший широкого потребителя. Это была большая новость, и сотни историй появились за несколько месяцев до выхода. Журнал Windows сказал:\"в этом году - к лучшему или худшему - Microsoft выигрывает войну\". В статье журнала Time говорилось, что Microsoft является \"центром компьютерной вселенной\". Появление Windows 95 само по себе было показано в основных телевизионных новостных передачах. Через пару месяцев, однако, все новости приняли противоположную точку зрения. Интернет ворвался в общественное сознание, и люди поверили, что Microsoft не была приглашена на новую вечеринку. Теперь в прессе появились сообщения о том, что мы не понимаем Интернета. Более мелкие и быстрые конкуренты вытеснили бы Microsoft из бизнеса.\n\n7 декабря 1995 года мы провели наш первый день Интернета, где впервые публично продемонстрировали спектр технологий, которые мы разрабатываем для внедрения интернет-поддержки в наши продукты. В течение года после этого мы \"включили Интернет\" наши основные продукты и поставили ряд новых, которые сосредоточились на интернете. Сейчас мы лидируем в нескольких крупных интернет-направлениях. Ни одна компания не будет доминировать в интернете, но Microsoft вернулась, чтобы играть важную роль.\n\nКак, часто спрашивают меня наши клиенты и пресса,мы так быстро развернули корабль? Во-первых, мы никогда не были настолько неосведомлены об интернете, как это могло бы показаться сторонним наблюдателям. Это не было похоже на то, что кто-то сказал \"Интернет\", и мы не знали, как это пишется. В нашем списке было несколько интернет-технологий. Но давайте также внесем ясность. В 1993 году мы не концентрировались на интернете. Это был пятый или шестой приоритет. В то время у нас не было общего интернет-плана для компании. Мы не ожидали, что интернет, сеть для ученых и инженеров, превратится во Всемирную коммерческую сеть, которой он является сегодня. Интернет тогда обладал такой ограниченной способностью передавать цифровую информацию, что мы рассматривали его как незначительную остановку на этом пути. Внезапный рост популярности Интернета изменил все правила. Люди знали, что у интернета есть недостатки, но он делал доступными огромные объемы информации и позволял легко общаться. Только в 1993 году число пользователей Интернета удвоилось и составило более двадцати пяти миллионов человек.\n\nДвижущая сила реакции Microsoft на интернет исходила не от меня и не от других руководителей высшего звена. Он исходил от небольшого числа восторженных сотрудников, которые видели, что происходит. Через наши электронные системы они смогли заставить всех присоединиться к ним. Их история-пример нашей практики, с самого первого дня, что умные люди в любом месте компании должны иметь власть, чтобы изменить ситуацию. Это очевидный способ работы компаний информационной эпохи: все работники умственного труда должны участвовать в создании плана. Но мы не могли бы заставить его работать без технологии, которую мы используем. В течение многих лет у каждого сотрудника Microsoft был компьютер с электронной почтой. Это известная часть нашей корпоративной культуры, и она формирует то, как мы думаем и действуем.\n\nБольшинство важных решений в ходе этого кризиса мы приняли в ходе личных бесед. Но все наши решения были основаны на обмене сообщениями по электронной почте. Совместная электронная работа не может заменить личных встреч. Это способ убедиться, что перед собраниями делается больше работы, чтобы личные встречи были более полезными. Время встречи настолько ценно, что вы хотите быть уверены, что имеете дело с фактами и хорошими идеями, основанными на твердом анализе. Вы хотите быть уверены, что на встречах вы строите планы, а не просто сидите и рассуждаете о философии. Электронная почта помогает превратить менеджеров из посредников в\"делателей\". Это побуждает людей высказываться. Это побуждает менеджеров прислушиваться. Вот почему, когда клиенты спрашивают, что они могут сделать в первую очередь, чтобы получить больше пользы от своих информационных систем, я всегда отвечаю: \"электронная почта\".\n\nНасколько быстро компания может отреагировать в чрезвычайной ситуации, является хорошим показателем того, насколько хорошо она реагирует на события. Люди в организации будут чувствовать угрозу от плохих новостей, но это нормально, если они чувствуют это как группа. Как лидер, я создал ощущение кризиса в Интернете в 1994 и 1995 годах. Не для того, чтобы оставить людей несчастными или неспособными работать, а для того, чтобы побудить их к действию. Лидер должен создать среду, в которой люди смогут проанализировать ситуацию и выработать адекватную реакцию.\n\nЯ люблю хорошие новости так же, как и любой другой человек, но они также вызывают у меня подозрения. Интересно, какие плохие новости я не слышу? Когда кто-то присылает мне электронное письмо о выигранном нами счете, я всегда думаю: \"есть много счетов, о которых никто не писал. Значит ли это, что мы все это потеряли?\n\nЭта реакция может показаться излишней,но я обнаружил, что у людей есть психологическая потребность посылать хорошие новости, когда приходят плохие. Как будто они хотят смягчить шок. Хорошая система электронной почты гарантирует, что плохие новости могут распространяться быстро, но ваши люди должны быть готовы отправить вам новости. Вы всегда должны быть открыты для плохих новостей, и тогда вы должны действовать в соответствии с ними. Иногда я думаю, что моя самая важная работа как босса-это выслушивать плохие новости. Если вы не будете действовать в соответствии с этим, ваши люди в конечном итоге перестанут сообщать вам плохие новости. И это начало конца.\n\nЧерез три года все продукты, которые производит моя компания, устареют. Вопрос только в том, заменим ли мы их или кто-то другой. В ближайшие десять лет, если Microsoft останется лидером, нам придется справиться как минимум с тремя крупными кризисами. Вот почему мы всегда должны делать лучше. Я настаиваю на том, чтобы мы следили за событиями, а также занимались долгосрочными проектами, и чтобы мы использовали \"плохие новости\", чтобы заставить нас внедрять новые функции в наши продукты. Однажды кто-нибудь застанет нас спящими. В один прекрасный день новая фирма выведет Microsoft из бизнеса. Я просто надеюсь, что это произойдет через пятьдесят лет, а не через два или пять.\n\nИзмените плохие новости на хорошие.\n\nЕсли вы относитесь к неприятным новостям не как к негативным, а как к свидетельству необходимости перемен, вы не будете побеждены ими. Ты учишься на этом. Учиться на ошибках и постоянно совершенствовать продукты-это ключ к успеху во всех компаниях. Слушание клиентов-большая часть этих усилий. Вы должны изучать то, что клиенты говорят о своих проблемах с вашими продуктами, и постоянно осознавать, чего они хотят.\n\nНо удивительно трудно получить плохие новости от клиентов, прошедших весь путь до групп дизайна продукта. Большинство компаний не имеют эффективной цепочки людей и бумаги между клиентами и людьми, которые могут сделать серьезные улучшения. Когда данные о клиентах, наконец, попадают в группу разработки продукта, команде часто бывает нелегко дать им правильный приоритет. Все эти задержки означают, что улучшения происходят не так быстро, как следовало бы.\n\nЯ рекомендую следующий подход к включению жалоб и списков пожеланий клиентов в процесс разработки продуктов и услуг:\n\n1. Сосредоточиться на ваши самые несчастные клиенты.\n\n2. используйте технологию, чтобы собрать богатую информацию об их неудачном опыте работы с вашим продуктом и выяснить, что они хотят, чтобы вы вложили в продукт.\n\n3. используйте технологию, чтобы быстро передавать новости нужным людям.\n\nЕсли вы сделаете эти три вещи, вы превратите эти плохие новости в захватывающий процесс улучшения вашего продукта или услуги. Недовольные клиенты всегда вызывают беспокойство. Они также являются вашей величайшей возможностью. Слушание и обучение вместо того, чтобы защищаться, могут сделать жалобы клиентов лучшим источником значительного улучшения качества. Принятие правильной технологии даст вам возможность быстро улавливать и преобразовывать жалобы в лучшие продукты и услуги.\n\nНапример, любой сотрудник Promus Hotels, базирующейся в Мемфисе, штат Теннесси, может вернуть клиентам их деньги, если они не удовлетворены. Гарантия возврата денег без вопросов от такой сервисной компании, как Promus, кое-что значит. У компании есть веская причина немедленно устранить проблему. И поскольку каждый сотрудник может действовать по гарантии, сотрудники следят за качеством. Так как же Promus останавливает клиентов, использующих гарантию бесплатного проживания и жалующихся, когда на самом деле все было в порядке? Технология. Все жалобы рассматриваются одним и тем же главным компьютером. Он может быстро идентифицировать любого, кто ходит из отеля в отель, заявляя о плохом обслуживании и получая деньги обратно. Затем промус посылает милое письмо, в котором сожалеет, что отели не могут соответствовать стандартам клиента, и приглашает его остановиться в отелях конкурента.\n\nЕсли ваши клиенты могут связаться с вами по электронной почте со своими проблемами, вы должны быть готовы ответить быстро. Когда клиент отправляет письмо в компанию, он не ожидает ответа в течение недели, но клиент знает, что письмо приходит через несколько минут, если не секунд. Обычно компании отвечают на электронную почту в течение нескольких часов или в течение ночи. Несколько дней - это \"медленно\". Если вам понадобятся недели, чтобы ответить, клиенты займутся своим бизнесом в другом месте. Поскольку электронную почту гораздо легче отправить, чем бумажную, вы, скорее всего, получите гораздо больше ответов. Поэтому, когда вы просите электронные ответы, убедитесь, что у вас есть персонал и внутренние системы, чтобы справиться с ними быстро.\n\nСлушайте своих клиентов и воспринимайте их плохие новости как возможность превратить ваши неудачи в улучшения, которые они хотят. Компании, которые рано инвестируют в цифровые нервные системы, чтобы фиксировать, анализировать и опираться на мнение клиентов, будут выделяться среди конкурентов. Вы должны рассматривать жалобы клиентов чаще, чем финансы компании. И ваши цифровые системы должны помочь вам превратить плохие новости в улучшенные продукты и услуги.\n\nЗнай свои цифры.\n\nJiffy Lube был мировым поставщиком автомобилей номер один, но он был убыточным, когда компания Pennzoil купила его в 1991 году. К 1997 году Jiffy Lube заработала 25 миллионов долларов-самый высокий заработок в своей истории и рост на 14 процентов по сравнению с 1996 годом. Jiffy Lube обслуживала 21 миллион автомобилей, что на 1,2 миллиона больше, чем в 1996 году. Движущей силой этого нового успеха был ежедневный поток информации из каждого магазина в штаб-квартиру и обратно. Информация об обслуживании клиентов из всех 1600 магазинов Jiffy Lube отправляется в штаб-квартиру в Хьюстоне каждую ночь. Штаб-квартира немедленно анализирует цифры. Начиная с 5 часов утра, последние данные доступны для каждого выхода смазки Jiffy. Например, если люди в одном районе не используют свою розетку Jiffy Lube так часто, как ожидалось, менеджер этой розетки будет знать об этом.\n\n\"Знай свои цифры\" - это основной бизнес-принцип. Вам нужно собирать данные о вашем бизнесе на каждом этапе и при каждом взаимодействии с вашими клиентами - и с вашими партнерами тоже. Тогда вам нужно понять, что означают эти данные. Цифры не должны быть вашей единственной заботой, но вы должны объективно понимать все возможное о вашем бизнесе. Например, если вы рассматриваете возможность обмена краткосрочной прибыли на долгосрочную прибыль, вам нужно как можно точнее знать стоимость этой сделки. Компании могут использовать собранные ими данные для повышения эффективности своего бизнеса, укрепления отношений как с клиентами, так и с партнерами, расширения своего бизнеса новыми способами и разработки более качественных услуг и новых продуктов.\n\nСуществует два способа использования данных клиентов. Во-первых, собрать цифры, которые показывают тенденции и закономерности, на которых основываются анализ, планирование и принятие решений. Второй - это сбор подробной информации об индивидуальном клиенте, чтобы вы могли предоставить персональное обслуживание. Создавая цифровой поток информации от начала до конца, компании могут создавать тесные связи между управлением знаниями, коммерцией и бизнес-операциями. В Microsoft мы показали большие улучшения, как только начали использовать MOET (Microsoft Order Entry Tool) для приема заказов клиентов, и MOET теперь является передовым веб-сайтом для электронной коммерции по всему миру.\n\nЧтобы хорошо использовать информацию, вам нужно с самого начала фиксировать ее в цифровом виде и анализировать в цифровом виде на каждом этапе ваших бизнес-процессов. \"Каждый этап\" включает в себя не только то, что происходит в стенах вашей компании, но и то, что происходит как с вашими клиентами, так и с вашими поставщиками. Знание ваших цифр может привести к большим изменениям во всех ваших деловых отношениях и дать вам значительное конкурентное преимущество.\n\nДеловая сторона любой компании начинается и заканчивается глубоким анализом ее численности. Что бы вы ни делали, если вы не понимаете, что происходит в вашем бизнесе на самом деле, и вы принимаете решения, основанные на мягких данных или эмоциях, вы в конечном итоге заплатите большую цену. Цифры дают вам фактическую основу для направления, в котором вы принимаете свои продукты. Они объективно говорят вам, что нравится клиентам, а что нет. Они помогают вам определить свои высшие приоритеты, чтобы вы могли быстро действовать. Ничто другое не может заменить понимание ваших чисел на рабочем уровне. Иногда мой друг Стив Балмер, президент Microsoft, удивляет членов продуктовой группы тем, что знает их ценовую структуру и показатели продаж - и конкурентов - лучше, чем люди, представляющие ему план. У него есть манера входить в комнату и сразу же задавать один вопрос, на который у команды нет ответа. Он выполнил свою работу, и он много думал о проблемах, которые вытекают из цифр. Он придает большое значение решениям, основанным на фактах.\n\nМенеджеры среднего звена в компании - это люди, которые должны анализировать цифры. Другие группы могут помочь, но люди, которые имеют дело с клиентами и конкурентными проблемами, должны каждый день смотреть на свой бизнес всеми возможными способами. Анализ должен поддерживать действия, а не просто еще больше анализа. Анализ должен шаг за шагом привести вас к решению и действию. Вы должны думать, действовать, судить, приспосабливаться.\n\nНачало работы с цифровыми числами не просто предотвращает ненужные усилия и ошибки. Это также приводит в движение лучшие способы последующей обработки данных. Будучи цифровым с самого начала, он повышает эффективность производства, доставки, выставления счетов и других операционных процессов. Получение данных в цифровом виде также является единственным способом убедиться, что вы получаете информацию достаточно быстро, чтобы реагировать на потребности клиентов до того, как это сделает ваш конкурент.\n\nЭта потребность в хорошей информации, чтобы побудить сотрудников к быстрым действиям, является одной из причин того, что \"бумажные номера\" беспокоят меня так же сильно, как бумажные формы. Напечатанная цифра объема продаж или напечатан номер на направления заказчиком является фиксированной. У вас нет возможности войти и проанализировать детали, стоящие за номером, или отправить его кому-нибудь по электронной почте, чтобы поговорить об этом. С номером бумаги, который выглядит неправильно, вы должны связаться с кем-то и сказать: \"я смотрю на этот отчет, и этот номер меня удивляет\". В большинстве случаев этому есть простое объяснение: клиент сделал большой заказ или отменил его. Вам ничего не нужно делать, но вы все равно хотите быстро узнать, почему результаты месяца выглядят странно. Если вы заметили тенденцию в бумажном отчете,трудно разослать бумагу и заставить людей проанализировать ее. Со временем вы перестаете обращать внимание, потому что это так трудно исследовать. Когда цифры находятся в цифровой форме, работники умственного труда могут изучать их, прикреплять к ним заметки, рассматривать их в любом количестве деталей или в любом виде, который они хотят, и передавать их, чтобы получить помощь. Число в цифровой форме-это начало мысли и действия.\n\nЦифровые технологии также позволяют компании создавать сеть партнеров, которая лучше обслуживает своих клиентов. Вы можете создать виртуальную компанию, в которой все объединены коммерцией, управлением знаниями и операционными системами. Ваши партнеры лучше связаны с вами, больше выигрывают от вашего успеха и естественно реагируют на те же модели поведения клиентов, что и вы.\n\nКогда ваши информационные системы предназначены для создания потока информации к вашим клиентам и от них, бизнес-процессы всей системы снабжения станут более эффективными. Своевременная доставка может стать реальностью для любой отрасли.\n\nЦифровой информационный поток позволяет создать организацию без ограничений, но требуется новая корпоративная культура, чтобы превратить поставщиков из \"них\" в \"нас\". Традиционно компании не рассматривали поставщиков как истинную часть общего бизнес-процесса, необходимого для обслуживания клиентов. Сегодняшний подход-это подход \"сети ценностей\", сети партнеров, поддерживаемой цифровым информационным потоком. Каждый, кто прикасается к продукту, должен добавлять ценность, и коммуникации идут как вперед, так и назад. Компании в сети создания ценности не ограничены тяжелыми цепочками процессов, но могут взаимодействовать и вести бизнес со многими различными продавцами по мере необходимости.\n\nЕсли преимущества знания ваших цифр и создания сети ценностей настолько убедительны, почему же больше компаний не делают этого? Почему все больше компаний не создают цифровой информационный поток для наблюдения за тенденциями? Почему они не следят за историей клиентов? Основная причина заключается в том, что слишком мало компаний начинают с цифровой информации. Существующие бумажные системы заставляют людей предполагать, что данные трудно получить и работать с ними. Им приходится работать с кипами бумаг, которые они не могут организовать или проанализировать. Они не могут найти закономерности в своих данных. Они не могут превратить свою бумажную информацию в действие. Поскольку сегодня так мало компаний используют цифровые инструменты внутри компании или с партнерами, те фирмы, которые действуют быстро, чтобы создать цифровую нервную систему, имеют возможность опередить своих конкурентов.\n\nЧтобы сделать переход к более эффективной виртуальной компании, нужно сначала посмотреть на все бумаги на столах работников умственного труда и спросить: как цифровые системы могли бы избавиться от этих кип бумаг? В рамках этого исследования подумайте о том, что ваши бизнес-процессы выходят далеко за пределы ваших стен и охватывают всю сеть ваших партнеров и клиентов. Вам нужно разработать бизнес-процессы, поддерживаемые быстрым и надежным потоком информации, который позволит клиенту управлять вашими ответами и ответами всех ваших продавцов, как если бы Вы были единым целым.\n\nВовлекайте людей в мыслительную работу.\n\nНеизбежным результатом совершенствования компьютерных систем является более разумное использование времени людей. Благодаря интеллектуальному программному обеспечению, постоянно просматривающему данные о продажах, отслеживающему тенденции и замечающему, что продается, а что нет, британская сеть магазинов Marks & Spencer может гораздо эффективнее использовать своих 500-600 покупателей.\n\nВместо того чтобы работать с толстыми бумажными отчетами за предыдущий день, пытаясь выяснить, хорошо ли идут продажи, покупатели могут использовать свое время более эффективно, используя то, что говорят им последние данные. Если продажи идут хорошо, никаких человеческих действий не требуется, но система проверяет данные о продажах и замечает любые товары, продажи которых выше или ниже ожидаемых. Отчеты по этим товарам создаются автоматически, и это все, с чем должны иметь дело покупатели.\n\nИспользование программного обеспечения для обработки рутинных задач обработки данных дает вам возможность обеспечить человеческое прикосновение там, где это действительно важно. Существует огромная разница между получением записки, которая была явно написана человеком, а не компьютером. Чрезвычайно ценно иметь человека, работающего с любым клиентом, который недоволен чем-то действительно важным или у которого есть особые потребности. Например, в отеле интеллектуальное программное обеспечение может значительно сократить время регистрации заезда и отъезда. Затем персонал может помочь клиентам, а не заполнять бланки, и в результате гости будут получать больше удовольствия от своего пребывания.\n\nОднако электронная торговля порождает новые проблемы. В физическом магазине продавец может использовать такие подсказки, как вопросы клиента, стиль одежды и язык тела, чтобы оценить его или ее интересы. Однако в интернет-магазине никто не видит клиента, и цель состоит в том, чтобы позволить клиенту сделать как можно больше покупок для себя. Владельцы интернет-магазинов тогда имеют некоторую интересную информацию, чтобы узнать. Основываясь на поведении клиента, как вы строите модель того, кто является покупателем? Это требует интеллектуального анализа данных.\n\nЦифровые инструменты анализа меняют характер работы. Работники умственного труда могут сосредоточиться на необычных событиях, а не на рутине. Конечно, людям не нравится, когда машины принимают за них решения. Но когда база данных становится достаточно большой и достаточно сложной, компьютер может выполнить первоначальный поиск и сортировку гораздо лучше, чем человек. Мы просто не способны распознавать закономерности в больших объемах данных. И доступные данные-в базах данных, файловых системах, системах сообщений и веб-сайтах-постоянно растут. Единственный способ получить полную ценность всех этих данных - использовать компьютерные инструменты для поиска полезной информации.\n\nИздательская компания HarperCollins использует компьютерную систему для отслеживания продаж книг, чтобы печатать достаточно книг, чтобы удовлетворить спрос. Таким образом, он не будет пойман с большими запасами непроданных книг в магазинах, которые издатели должны забрать обратно. После всего лишь года работы новая система помогла HarperCollins снизить доходность непроданных экземпляров своих самых популярных книг с более чем 30 процентов до примерно 10 процентов. Каждый процентный пункт представляет собой миллионы долларов сбережений.\n\nИспользование программного обеспечения для поиска полезных шаблонов в больших объемах данных называется интеллектуальным анализом данных. Это может помочь предсказать, будут ли покупатели покупать товар из-за их возраста, пола, родного города и других характеристик. Он также может идентифицировать клиентов с похожим поведением при совершении покупок и клиентов со специфическими вкусами, чтобы обеспечить улучшенное индивидуальное обслуживание. Австралийская медицинская компания использовала интеллектуальный анализ данных для отслеживания моделей покупок и обнаружила мошенничество на 10 миллионов долларов.\n\nЧаще всего интеллектуальный анализ данных используется для маркетинга баз данных, в котором компании анализируют данные, чтобы выявить вкусы клиентов, а затем делают предложения определенным группам людей. Например, American Airlines использует информацию о двадцати шести миллионах участников своей программы частых полетов - таких как компании по прокату автомобилей, отели и рестораны, которыми они пользуются, - для разработки целевых маркетинговых мероприятий, которые позволили сэкономить более 100 миллионов долларов.\n\nИнтеллектуальный анализ данных является частью системы управления взаимоотношениями с клиентами (CRM), в которой информационные технологии помогают компаниям управлять отношениями с клиентами индивидуально, а не все вместе. Используя паттерны, выявленные с помощью интеллектуального анализа данных, вы можете представить свои продукты клиенту таким образом, который, скорее всего, повысит вашу ценность для клиента и его ценность для вас. Экономия средств достигается за счет более точных моделей клиентов, и поэтому количество рассылок сокращается. Прямая маркетинговая кампания для чего-то вроде кредитных карт, например, обычно приносит доход около 2 процентов. Mellon Bank USA в 1997 году имел целевую аудиторию в 200 000 новых клиентов,что обычно означало рассылку до 10 миллионов человек. Вместо этого банк использовал интеллектуальный анализ данных для создания моделей наиболее вероятных новых клиентов. Тогда банк смог достичь своей цели в 200 000 новых клиентов с почтовой рассылкой в 2 миллиона, а не в 10 миллионов. В дополнение к снижению затрат, каждый новый клиент был в три раза выгоднее, чем обычно, потому что интеллектуальный анализ данных был нацелен на клиентов, чьи потребности лучше всего соответствовали услугам Mellon Bank.\n\nТакая персонализация глубоко повлияет на все формы рекламы. По мере того как цифровое телевидение становится все более популярным, а электронные книги становятся предпочтительным способом чтения журналов и газет, почти вся реклама будет переходить от массовой рекламы к персонализированной. Рекламные ролики, которые появляются на экране, будут отличаться в зависимости от того, кто на них смотрит; разные районы или даже разные дома в одном и том же районе могут видеть разные рекламные ролики. Крупные компании могут стать более эффективными со своей рекламой, а небольшие компании могут впервые рассмотреть рекламу на телевидении и в журналах. Сегодня многие виды рекламы слишком дороги для любой, кроме истинно массовой продукции. Скоро даже местный бакалейщик сможет позволить себе рекламу для людей, живущих рядом с магазином.\n\nТаргетированная реклама должна радовать клиентов. Они с большей вероятностью увидят рекламу, имеющую к ним отношение. Некоторые люди могут быть обеспокоены тем, что рекламодатели имеют слишком много информации о них, но программное обеспечение позволит людям раскрывать только ту информацию, которую они хотят раскрыть. Например, большинство людей не возражали бы, если бы рекламодателям давали шаблоны просмотра. Большинство постоянных читателей специализированных журналов - будь то спорт, еда, наука, садоводство или автомобили-смотрят на рекламу так же внимательно, как и на статьи. Если вы смотрите телевизор таким же образом, в основном для одного или двух интересов, вы, вероятно, не будете возражать против просмотра рекламных роликов, которые концентрируются на этих интересах.\n\nСегодня большинство систем интеллектуального анализа данных стоят довольно дорого - от 25 000 до 150 000 долларов для малого или среднего бизнеса и до миллионов долларов для крупного клиента, такого как Wal-Mart. Пять лет назад одна страховая компания потратила 10 миллионов долларов на систему интеллектуального анализа данных. Босс сказал, что он знает, что может получить те же результаты за гораздо меньшие деньги с сегодняшней технологией, но преимущества стоили инвестиций.\n\nЭто замечание указывает на ценность интеллектуального анализа данных, но эти высокие цены отражают старые времена сложного программного обеспечения, в котором только крупнейшие организации, используя много сотрудников или нанимая специалистов, могли хорошо использовать данные. С ростом конкуренции в нашей информационной экономике данные о клиентах становятся все более важным активом. Каждая компания и каждый работник, работающий в сфере знаний, должны стараться получить максимальную отдачу от информационных активов компании. Эти новые пользователи не могут позволить себе большие бюджеты баз данных или специализированных экспертов по базам данных.\n\nК счастью, по мере того, как системы интеллектуального анализа данных станут доступны для ПК, вы увидите, что цены резко упадут, а использование интеллектуального анализа данных взорвется в компаниях и отделах всех размеров. Скоро каждая компания сможет проводить тот анализ, который раньше был зарезервирован для самых богатых организаций.\n\nНаибольшая ценность интеллектуального анализа данных будет заключаться в том, чтобы помочь компаниям выбрать правильные продукты для создания и правильный способ их оценки. Компании смогут посмотреть на различные варианты упаковки и цены, чтобы увидеть, какие из них наиболее привлекательны для клиентов и выгодны для них самих. Эти возможности представляют особый интерес для компаний, продающих информационные продукты. В отличие от автомобиля или кресла, такие продукты, как страхование, финансовые услуги и книги, стоят гораздо дороже, чем их производство, и имеют ценность, фиксируемую больше потребителем, чем физической стоимостью товаров. Секрет успеха информационных продуктов заключается в понимании особенностей и покупательских привычек ваших наиболее вероятных клиентов.\n\nСила интеллектуального анализа данных поможет компаниям решить, как приобретать новых клиентов, кому продавать, как оценивать свои продукты и как привлекать отдельных клиентов. Чтобы использовать эту информацию для создания новых идей по упаковке и ценообразованию, видеть новые продукты в шаблонах компьютерных результатов и разрабатывать новые захватывающие предложения, необходимы творческие способности и навыки человека. Чем лучше инструмент, тем более творческими они могут быть.\n\nМенеджеры должны инвестировать в передовые инструменты, которые помогают людям работать. Вы должны выделять от 3 до 4 процентов от зарплаты ваших работников умственного труда, чтобы убедиться, что у них есть лучшие инструменты, которые позволяют людям использовать свою энергию для творческих реакций на паттерны и тенденции, выявленные компьютером. Использование информации для разработки новых продуктов и услуг, а также для более тесного сотрудничества с партнерами и клиентами всегда будет оставаться исключительно человеческой задачей.\n\nПовысьте свой корпоративный IQ.\n\nКак и реинжиниринг до него, \"управление знаниями\" получило так много значений, что иногда кажется, что оно означает все, что кто-то хочет. Регулярно появляются новостные статьи на эту тему. Консалтинговые компании и веб-сайты специализируются на управлении знаниями, а в 1998 году появился журнал\" Управление знаниями\". Если репортеры поговорят с компанией, занимающейся базами данных, они обнаружат, что управление знаниями-это новейшая вещь в базах данных. Если журналисты общаются с сетевой компанией, они обнаруживают, что управление знаниями означает будущее сетей. Но как общая концепция-собирать и систематизировать информацию, передавать ее людям, которые в ней нуждаются, и постоянно совершенствовать информацию посредством анализа и совместной работы - управление знаниями полезно.\n\nТак что давайте сначала проясним пару вещей. Управление знаниями, как я здесь выражаюсь, не является программным продуктом или категорией программного обеспечения. Управление знаниями даже не начинается с технологии. Она начинается с бизнес-целей и процессов и понимания необходимости обмена информацией. Управление знаниями - это не что иное, как управление информационным потоком, передача нужной информации людям, которые в ней нуждаются, чтобы они могли действовать быстро. А управление знаниями - это средство, а не цель.\n\nЦель состоит в том, чтобы повысить корпоративный IQ. В сегодняшней быстро изменяющейся ситуации на рынке, предприятие должно высоким корпоративным IQ, чтобы добиться успеха. Под корпоративным IQ я имею в виду не только наличие большого количества умных людей в вашей компании - хотя это помогает начать с умных людей.\n\nКорпоративный IQ-это показатель того, насколько легко ваша компания может широко делиться информацией и насколько хорошо люди в вашей организации могут опираться на идеи друг друга. Корпоративный IQ предполагает обмен как историческими, так и текущими знаниями. Работники в компании с высоким корпоративным IQ работают вместе эффективно, так что все ключевые люди в проекте хорошо информированы и полны энергии. Конечная цель состоит в том, чтобы команда разработала лучшие идеи из всей организации, а затем действовала с той же целью и концентрацией, что и один энтузиаст. Цифровой информационный поток может помочь группам функционировать подобно отдельным людям.\n\nВысшие руководители компании должны верить в обмен знаниями, иначе даже серьезные усилия по обмену знаниями потерпят неудачу. Лидеры также должны показать, что они сами не заперты во дворце, изолированы от всех остальных, но готовы взаимодействовать с сотрудниками. Жак (Jac) Насер, операционный президент Ford, каждую пятницу после обеда рассылает электронное письмо 89 000 сотрудников Ford по всему миру, делясь новостями недели-хорошими и плохими - со всеми. Никто не проверяет электронную почту. Он разговаривает прямо с сотрудниками. Он также читает сотни ответов, которые получает каждый месяц, и назначает члена своей команды, чтобы ответить на любой, который нуждается в ответе.\n\nЯ не рассылаю еженедельные отчеты, но рассылаю по электронной почте сотрудникам по всему миру важные темы. Как и Джак Насер, я читаю всю электронную почту, которую мне присылают сотрудники, и передаю людям информацию для действий. Я нахожу электронную почту, которую мне присылают люди, удивительно хорошим способом оставаться в курсе отношений и проблем, затрагивающих многих людей, работающих в Microsoft.\n\nКогда бизнес-лидеры создают атмосферу, которая поощряет командную работу и обмен знаниями, им необходимо создать конкретные проекты по обмену знаниями в рамках всей организации и сделать обмен знаниями ключевой частью самой работы, а не дополнительной, которую можно безопасно игнорировать. Тогда лидеры должны быть уверены, что люди, которые делятся знаниями, будут вознаграждены. Старая поговорка\" Знание-сила \" иногда заставляет людей держать Знание при себе. Они считают, что это делает их более ценными для компании. Сила приходит не от знания, которое хранится, а от знания, которым делятся. Ценности и система вознаграждения компании должны отражать эту идею.\n\nУправление знаниями может помочь любому бизнесу в четырех основных областях: планирование, обслуживание клиентов, обучение и совместная работа над проектами. Если вы еще не занимались управлением знаниями в своей компании, подумайте о том, чтобы выбрать одну или две области, в которых можно начать проекты по управлению знаниями. Вы можете использовать успех своих проектов в этих областях для поощрения проектов по управлению знаниями в других областях вашего бизнеса. В течение нескольких лет все ведущие компании достигнут высокого уровня цифрового обмена знаниями.\n\nОбмен знаниями может помочь в планировании бренда в разных странах. В 1980-х годах Coca-Cola установила всемирную коммуникацию со своей собственной системой электронной почты, но она рассматривала ее как расходы, которые нужно контролировать, а не как инструмент для улучшения бизнеса. Когда это изменилось, все системы и функции стали совместимыми во всем мире, и самым большим потребителем технологий стал маркетинг, а не финансы. Маркетинговый инструмент Inform (информация для маркетинга) рассматривает данные о потребительских предпочтениях в каждой стране. Из данных о продажах он может сказать вам, какие типы людей в маленьком городке в Южной Африке пьют Спрайт каждый день и сколько они выпили в марте прошлого года.\n\nУправление знаниями может быть использовано для более быстрого реагирования на запросы клиентов. Компания Yamanouchi Pharmaceuticals, имеющая 3,9 миллиарда долларов, является третьей по величине фармацевтической компанией в Японии. Они и Microsoft сделали веб-информационные системы важной частью повышения качества и скорости ответов на технические вопросы клиентов. Служба поддержки продуктов компании Yamanouchi может немедленно ответить примерно на половину вопросов, поступающих от врачей. Чтобы найти ответы на более сложные вопросы, они используют веб-систему поддержки информационного центра продуктов Yamanouchi или PRINCESS. При этом используется электронный поиск по продукту и по слову. Ответы вводятся в систему для использования в следующий раз. В 1998 году PRINCESS была предоставлена в распоряжение отдела продаж. Следующим шагом могло бы стать предоставление ее в распоряжение самих врачей.\n\nОнлайн-обучение-это еще одна область, где управление знаниями может сделать вещи быстрее и лучше. Американский веб обучает людей использовать технологии в бизнесе. Он разработал SiteCast для интерактивных семинаров. Онлайн-обучение было очень популярно в Microsoft. В 1998 году в интернете обучалось вдвое больше людей, чем в классе.\n\nЦифровой информационный поток также может помочь в разработке продукта. В набиско есть одни из самых популярных продуктов в мире. Около трети его новых продуктов пользуются успехом во всем мире, треть делает все хорошо, а еще треть отстает. Эти результаты лучше, чем в среднем, но с ростом конкуренции Nabisco решила больше использовать информационные технологии в процессе разработки продукта. Набиско не нуждался в процессе разработки нового продукта. Технология была необходима, чтобы помочь команде разработчиков продукта общаться друг с другом лучше и быстрее. Система под названием Journey теперь организует информацию, которая раньше была в любом месте на любом столе в офисе. Всем людям, участвующим в разработке любого нового продукта, достаточно лишь нажать на него, чтобы найти всю информацию о нем. Например, Nabisco разработала новый продукт, и что-то в нем изменилось. Люди, написавшие описание продукта на этикетке, увидели изменение в интернете и немедленно изменили этикетку.\n\nУправление знаниями-это причудливый термин для обозначения простой идеи. Вы управляете данными, документами и усилиями людей. Ваша цель должна состоять в том, чтобы улучшить то, как люди работают вместе, обмениваются идеями, иногда спорят и развивают идеи друг друга, а затем действуют вместе для достижения общей цели. Роль босса в повышении корпоративного IQ компании заключается в создании атмосферы, способствующей обмену знаниями и совместной работе, в приоритете тех областей, в которых обмен знаниями наиболее ценен, в предоставлении цифровых инструментов, которые делают обмен знаниями возможным, и в вознаграждении людей за вклад в полный поток информации.\n\nБольшие победы требуют больших рисков.\n\nЧтобы быть лидером рынка, у вас должны быть большие цели. Вы не можете просто смотреть на прошлое или текущее состояние рынка. Вы также должны посмотреть, куда это может пойти, и куда это может пойти при определенных обстоятельствах, а затем направить свою компанию в соответствии с вашими лучшими прогнозами. Чтобы выиграть по-крупному, иногда приходится идти на большой риск. Большие ставки означают большие неудачи, а также успехи. Сегодня, оглядываясь назад, легко поверить, что нынешний успех Microsoft был неизбежен. Но в то время, когда мы делали большие ставки - в том числе начинали компанию как первую фирму по разработке программного обеспечения для персональных компьютеров, - большинство людей думали, что мы потерпим неудачу.\n\nМногие ведущие компании не решались перейти на новые технологии, опасаясь разрушить успех существующих. Они получили тяжелый урок. Если вы не пойдете на риск раньше, то упадете на рынке позже. Однако, если вы делаете большие ставки, только некоторые из этих рисков должны быть успешными, чтобы обеспечить ваше будущее. Текущие цели Microsoft включают в себя повышение производительности ПК за пределами всех существующих систем, разработку компьютеров, которые \"видят, слушают и учатся\", и создание программного обеспечения для питания новых персональных компьютеров-компаньонов. Эти планы являются ответом Microsoft на будущее, в котором все машины будут использовать цифровые технологии и должны работать друг с другом. Независимо от того, увенчаются ли эти планы успехом или нет, ясно одно: мы должны пойти на этот риск, чтобы иметь долгосрочное будущее.\n\nВ новой отрасли риск естественен. Компьютерная индустрия находится в таком же развитии, как автомобили в 1910-х годах и самолеты в 1930-х. Эти отрасли прошли через революционные и часто беспорядочные технические и деловые изменения, прежде чем они стали стабильными, и то же самое происходит в компьютерной индустрии.\n\nРазвивайте процессы, которые дают людям власть.\n\nБизнес имеет процессы, которые похожи на основные биологические процессы, которые поддерживают нашу жизнь. Одним из таких процессов является функция, определяющая причину существования компании - например, производственный процесс. Эта функция должна быть такой же эффективной и надежной, как биение сердца.\n\nВторым видом автоматического процесса в бизнесе является административный-процесс получения платежей, оплаты счетов и заработной платы, например. Административные процессы так же важны для бизнеса, как дыхание. Если основные операционные процессы вашего бизнеса терпят неудачу, ваша компания терпит неудачу.\n\nПоскольку основные операционные процессы так важны - и так дороги-большинство крупных компаний начали вкладывать значительные средства в их автоматизацию много лет назад. Но слишком часто автоматизированные процессы были изолированы друг от друга. Общая эффективность была далеко не так хороша, как могла бы быть. До недавнего времени, например, при изготовлении некоторых деталей самолета фактически использовалось только 10 процентов исходного металла. Производственный процесс был усовершенствован на многих отдельных этапах, а не в целом. Там было огромное количество отходов.\n\nВ других разделах я говорил о деловых операциях, таких как финансовые и другие административные системы. В этом разделе я сосредоточусь на производственных процессах. Автоматизированный производственный процесс необходим, но недостаточно сам по себе, чтобы сделать компанию конкурентоспособной сегодня. Хорошая цифровая нервная система может помочь вам превратить ваших сотрудников в работников умственного труда, превратив основные производственные процессы вашей компании в конкурентное преимущество.\n\nВо-первых, вы должны использовать информационные технологии, чтобы лучше понять внутреннюю работу самого процесса, чтобы сделать его более эффективным и более чутким к меняющимся обстоятельствам. Корпорация Entergy из Нового Орлеана повысила эффективность своих электростанций с помощью новой системы управления технологическими процессами. Это позволяет операторам установок регулировать эффективность установки и анализировать тенденции производительности по мере их возникновения. Операторы могут фактически заглянуть внутрь систем завода, чтобы точно понять, как работают машины, и решить, может ли незначительное изменение или ремонт сэкономить дорогостоящий ремонт позже.\n\nИнтеллектуальная система на базе ПК гарантирует, что наиболее приоритетные элементы будут отремонтированы в первую очередь. Система управления процессом фактически показывает операторам стоимость снижения эффективности, если температура, например, на десять градусов ниже, чем должна быть. Прилагая долларовую цифру к оперативным решениям, Entergy превращает своих операторов в деловых людей, предоставляя им информацию, необходимую для эффективного управления их подразделениями, и делая их гораздо более ответственными за свои решения. А поскольку производственные затраты на заводы Entergy доступны руководящему персоналу в электронном виде поминутно, компания может повысить свою прибыль, постоянно перемещая производство электроэнергии на те агрегаты, которые обеспечивают наиболее экономичную энергию.\n\nЗатем вы должны иметь возможность получать данные из вашего производственного процесса для информирования других бизнес-систем. Компания \"Степан\", производящая чистящие средства, разработала систему управления технологическими процессами, которая позволила увеличить производительность завода на 300 процентов и сэкономить компании миллионы долларов за счет более эффективного использования оборудования. Но повышение эффективности не так ценно для Степана, как то, как его система управления технологическими процессами справляется с меняющимися требованиями клиентов.\n\nНаконец, и это самое важное, вам нужно передать данные из вашего производственного процесса производственным работникам, чтобы они могли улучшить качество самого продукта. Если вы предоставите правильную технологию, чтобы помочь производственным работникам сделать быстрый анализ, они превратят данные в информацию, которая поможет вам улучшить дизайн и уменьшить количество ошибок. Развитие цифровой нервной системы позволяет вам дать больше энергии как можно большему числу ваших работников.\n\nВ новой организации работник больше не является частью машины, а является разумной частью общего процесса. Некоторые металлурги теперь должны знать математику, чтобы вычислять углы по компьютеризированным чертежам. Компании по очистке воды обучают работников производственных линий компьютерным измерениям и математике. Новые цифровые копировальные аппараты требуют от обслуживающего персонала понимания компьютеров и интернета, а не только умения обращаться с отверткой.\n\nЛюди по-прежнему играют важную роль в оперативных процессах, которые должны постоянно совершенствоваться и адаптироваться к меняющимся обстоятельствам. Эффективная производственная линия нуждается в людях-хорошо информированных, ответственных. Организуя задачи в процессы, мы даем работникам больше ответственности. Компьютеры возьмут на себя некоторые работы, но это будет означать, что многие другие работы больше не будут скучными.\n\nКогда люди могут сосредоточиться на целых процессах, их работа становится более интересной и сложной. Простые задачи исчезнут, будут автоматизированы или встроены в более масштабный процесс. Работа, которая включает в себя повторение одной и той же задачи снова и снова, - это именно то, что лучше всего удается компьютерам и другим машинам, а человеческие работники плохо приспособлены и почти всегда ненавидят. Управление процессом вместо выполнения задачи делает человека работником знаний, а хороший цифровой информационный поток позволяет работникам знаний играть свои уникальные роли.\n\nБольшинство компаний готовы предоставить информационные инструменты своим высокооплачиваемым офисным сотрудникам,чья работа-информационная. Энтерги и Степан доказывают, что построение систем вокруг информационных потоков и предоставление информационных инструментов линейным работникам также может обеспечить огромную ценность. Entergy меняет все свои ключевые бизнес-процессы и продвигает информацию и принятие решений на операционный уровень. Степан использует информацию для управления своими заводами в целом, чтобы адаптироваться к меняющимся потребностям клиентов. Обе эти компании применяют управление знаниями к бизнес-операциям для анализа и улучшения производства, качества и частоты отказов. Цифровые инструменты привносят больше интеллекта в их бизнес-операции.\n\nДайте своим работникам лучшую работу с лучшими инструментами, и вы обнаружите, что ваши сотрудники станут более ответственными и привнесут больше интеллекта в свою работу. В цифровую эпоху вам нужно сделать работников умственного труда из каждого сотрудника, которого вы можете.\n\nГлава четвертая.\n\nСпециальные Проекты.\n\nНикакая система здравоохранения не является островом.\n\nНесколько лет назад новый сотрудник Microsoft был вызван обратно в свой родной штат, потому что его мать перенесла легкий инсульт. Когда она достаточно поправилась, чтобы выписаться из больницы, Миссис Джонс (не настоящее ее имя) осталась с сестрой, пока ее сын завершал планы по переезду ее к нему. Миссис Джонс в значительной степени выздоровела, но больше никогда не могла жить самостоятельно, и ее периоды хорошего здоровья прерывались больницами для лечения все более и более серьезных проблем.\n\nМедицинские события последних двух лет жизни миссис Джонс показывают лучшие и худшие стороны американской системы здравоохранения. Она получила хороший уход, включая ряд очень новых методов лечения, из трех разных больниц и более дюжины врачей в двух разных штатах. По мере того как ее физические способности снижались, ее семья из среднего класса смогла найти хорошие учреждения, обеспечивающие большую степень ухода. \"Медикэр\" и ее собственная частная страховка оплачивали большую часть счетов; она и ее семья оплачивали остальное. Ее многочисленные врачи, медсестры и другие воспитатели были профессиональными и добрыми.\n\nНо система была далека от совершенства. Когда миссис Джонс уехала из первой больницы в родной город своей сестры, находившийся в пятидесяти километрах отсюда, сбой связи между врачами означал, что ее лекарство поддерживалось в полной силе, в то время как Миссис Джонс должна была принимать уменьшающуюся дозу. К тому времени, когда она прибыла на Северо-Запад, побочные эффекты высокой дозы привели к тому, что ей пришлось немедленно лечь в больницу. Поскольку ее записи не пришли вместе с ней, пришлось повторить ряд дорогостоящих тестов.\n\nТо же самое произошло, когда год спустя она сменила больницу. Ее заключительное трехнедельное пребывание в больнице, которое не предполагало никакой операции, все еще стоило 25 000 долларов. В какой-то момент врач перепутал ее с другим пациентом и сказал ее следующему врачу, что ее недавнее пребывание в больнице было \"злоупотреблением системой\". Это было меньше чем за неделю до смерти миссис Джонс.\n\nЭти и другие проблемы продолжались, несмотря на то, что у миссис Джонс была семья, которая помогала ей работать в запутанных медицинских и социальных службах. Ее сын и невестка по очереди часами стояли в очереди в одном агентстве или разговаривали по телефону с другим. И прошел год, прежде чем они смогли убедить одну больницу прекратить выставлять им счета за услуги, которые были оплачены полностью.\n\nИз-за большого количества больниц, врачей, медицинских учреждений, государственных и частных агентств, связанных с этим, объем бумажной работы был огромным. Подумайте о количестве людей, которых представляли эти документы. На каждого врача и медсестру, которые лечили Миссис Джонс, приходилось не меньше дюжины человек в разных организациях. Это было похоже на старомодную военную операцию. На каждого солдата в тылу приходилось по двадцать человек, управлявших администрацией.\n\nПо оценкам большинства экспертов, от 20 до 30 процентов ежегодных триллионных расходов американской системы здравоохранения тратится на бумажную работу. В больницах это число может достигать 40-40 процентов. Одна неделя пребывания может создать до ста листов бумаги. И, что еще хуже, около 13 процентов от одного до двух миллиардов претензий каждый год в Соединенных Штатах возвращаются за ошибки.\n\nБумажная волокита и сложность возросли даже тогда, когда индустрия здравоохранения США перешла на \"управляемый уход\" в попытке сократить расходы, предотвратить мошенничество и обеспечить надлежащий уход. При управляемом уходе организация заключает контракт с группой врачей на оказание медицинских услуг с целью достижения управляемых результатов и за фиксированную плату. Более 160 миллионов человек в Соединенных Штатах были охвачены планами управляемого ухода в начале 1997 года-последнего года, по которому имеются данные.\n\nВрачи понимают необходимость контролировать расходы, но чувствуют себя похороненными в правилах и слоях управления. Они боятся, что их медицинские возможности могут быть ограничены и что уход за пациентами может пострадать. Они также усложнили ситуацию, рассматривая файлы пациентов как деловые записи и часто не решаясь поделиться ими с конкурирующими врачами. И они в основном были против компьютеров, хотя это в основном потому, что ранние медицинские системы были неуклюжими и дорогими. Как ни странно, управляемая забота, которую многие врачи любят ненавидеть, может стать основной силой, которая распространяет информационные системы на уход за пациентами и возвращает контроль над уходом за пациентами врачам. Когда вы предоставляете врачам достаточно клинически полезной информации, они видят преимущества и просят больше.\n\nПациенты, тем временем, осознают, насколько больше информации доступно им в интернете и как эта информация дает им чувство контроля и ответственности в поддержании собственного здоровья.\n\nКлинические преимущества также побудили руководителей здравоохранения настаивать на совершенствовании информационных систем. До сих пор здравоохранение использовало только 2-3 процента своих доходов на информационные технологии, по сравнению с 15 процентами банковской отрасли. Хотя здравоохранение является высокотехнологичной областью, эта технология применяется к индивидуальным системам лечения, а не к информационным потокам. Часто используемое информационное программное обеспечение не предназначено для работы с другими информационными программами, несмотря на все области здравоохранения, которые должны обмениваться данными: лаборатория, банк крови, картографические системы, биллинговые системы и машины, которые следят за пациентами.\n\nОрганизациям приходилось создавать специальные интерфейсы между различными программами. Типичная организация здравоохранения может иметь сотни таких интерфейсов. В настоящее время одна организация управляет 1800 различными интерфейсами. Эта сложность является одной из причин, по которой организации здравоохранения обычно требуется два года, чтобы купить новую систему, и еще два года, чтобы установить ее-слишком медленно по любым стандартам.\n\nСегодня ситуация более обнадеживающая. Правительство США приняло законы, которые требуют определения стандарта для электронных финансовых и административных операций, включая компьютерные записи пациентов. Улучшение обработки информации в медицинских организациях станет обязательным требованием в будущем. Некоторые организации здравоохранения, признавая, что потребности их пациентов не могут ждать, демонстрируют сильное лидерство. Они доказывают, что цифровая нервная система может быть чрезвычайно полезна во всех областях ухода за пациентами: от экстренных служб до стационарного лечения, поддержания связи с пациентами и долгосрочного анализа тенденций.\n\nПредставьте себе, что у вас есть система здравоохранения в вашем местном сообществе, построенная из цифровых частей. Интеллектуальная система экстренной помощи быстро доставит вас в больницу, и вся важная информация о вашей истории болезни и текущем состоянии здоровья немедленно поступит в компьютеры больницы. Врач использует сенсорный экран, клавиатуру или ручку, чтобы заказать ваше лечение. Цифровые инструкции отправляются в лаборатории. Компьютеры поставляют лабораторные результаты в электронном виде. Эти и другие отчеты находятся в интернете для удобного просмотра любым врачом, как на месте, так и вне его. Система будет сообщать врачам о любых возможных проблемах с лечением или отклонениях от утвержденного клинического пути. Выставление счетов осуществляется автоматически. Системы, обрабатывающие компьютерные сделки, обнаруживают мошенничество или необычное использование.\n\nВместо того чтобы тратить половину своего времени на бумажную работу, врачи и медсестры тратят почти все свое время на лечение вас и других своих пациентов. Результаты тестов и счета доходят до вас простым, понятным языком. Вся информация о вашем лечении и лекарствах автоматически оценивается в долгосрочной перспективе, чтобы помочь предотвратить проблемы.\n\nВаш уход после больницы также запланирован автоматически. Вы находите медицинскую информацию в интернете, и поэтому ваши встречи с медицинскими работниками более информированы, независимо от того, общаетесь ли вы с ними через Интернет, по электронной почте или встречаетесь лично. Вы используете электронную почту, чтобы задавать обычные вопросы своему врачу и получать напоминания о продолжающихся программах здравоохранения.\n\nКогда вы меняете планы здоровья, вся ваша история болезни идет с вами, а не теряется или следует за вами несколько месяцев спустя. Врачи используют ваш анамнез, чтобы определить тенденции в кровяном давлении, весе и других моделях, которые могут выявить серьезную развивающуюся проблему. Систематический медицинский анализ всего общества позволяет властям узнавать о любых тревожных тенденциях в области общественного здравоохранения гораздо раньше и точнее, чем это было возможно раньше.\n\nЕсли медицинские сообщества используют подход, основанный на компьютерных и веб-технологиях, такие способности не должны стоить целое состояние. ПК обеспечивают пошаговый подход с использованием стандартизированного программного обеспечения. В настоящее время ПК также используются для управления специализированными машинами, такими как анализаторы крови и тканей, что снижает их стоимость и позволяет обмениваться данными.\n\nПК достаточно мощны, чтобы обрабатывать сотни тысяч заявлений или запросов в час. Все вместе технологии, описанные в этой главе, обойдутся типичной организации здравоохранения менее чем в 5 миллионов долларов. Это немалая сумма, но она незначительна по сравнению с той суммой, которую большинство медицинских организаций тратят сегодня на бумажную работу и автономные компьютерные системы. С учетом того, что бумажная работа составляет от 20 до 30 процентов годового дохода системы здравоохранения США в размере 1 триллиона долларов, текущие расходы составляют от 200 до 300 миллиардов долларов в год - больше, чем весь доход многих стран.\n\nСегодня отсутствие информационных систем в кабинетах врачей является самым большим препятствием для улучшения ухода за пациентами. Только около 5% офисов в Соединенных Штатах используют компьютерные системы в своей клинической работе. Компьютеризация кабинета врача будет стоить от 10 000 до 50 000 долларов за каждый, но врачи могут быстро возместить затраты. Офис с пятью врачами в Хаммонде, штат Луизиана, инвестировал около 50 000 долларов в компьютерные системы для пациентов, которые облегчали врачам ввод данных; офис сэкономил 60 000 долларов в первый год только на расходах на набор текста.\n\nМедицинские работники приложат большие усилия для улучшения медицинского обслуживания с помощью цифровой информации. Технология доступна и сегодня. Инвестиции в общую инфраструктуру и инструменты позволят не только значительно сократить расходы, но и улучшить медицинское обслуживание для всех. Перемены будут вызваны двумя группами: пациентами, которые настаивают на том, чтобы быть лучше информированными и более вовлеченными в свое собственное здоровье, и медицинскими работниками, которые используют эти новые инструменты для обеспечения лучшего ухода. Вместе они будут использовать цифровую нервную систему, чтобы превратить острова здравоохранения в единый континент.\n\nВозьмите правительство к народу.\n\nПравительство, возможно, больше, чем любая другая организация, может извлечь выгоду из эффективности и улучшения обслуживания, которые вытекают из цифровых процессов. Развитые страны будут лидировать в создании безбумажных процессов для сокращения административных расходов. Развивающиеся страны смогут предоставлять новые услуги, не прибегая к неуклюжим бумажным методам.\n\nНо большинство правительств далеко отстают от бизнеса в использовании инструментов цифровой эпохи. Компании, переходящие на цифровые технологии, застряли со многими бумажными формами, потому что правительства еще не подключены к интернету. Причина этой задержки - отсутствие организационной цели. Поскольку в государственных процессах используется много бумаги и людей, в прошлом повышение их \"эффективности\" часто означало сокращение обслуживания. Обычно правительства запрещают агентствам закрывать какие-либо офисы, что просто заставляет их бороться за то, чтобы делать больше с меньшими затратами.\n\nВ то же время существует небольшое давление, чтобы обеспечить лучшее обслуживание. Граждане не могут сдать свой бизнес в другой налоговый орган или в Бюро регистрации транспортных средств. Государственные учреждения, как правило, концентрируются на собственных внутренних организационных потребностях, а не на широких потребностях граждан и бизнеса. В качестве примера рассмотрим документы, связанные с наймом поставщика услуг по уходу за детьми в Соединенных Штатах. Работодатель должен знать, что существует пять агентств, каждое из которых имеет свой набор форм. Это осложнение, а не желание избежать уплаты налогов, объясняет, почему так мало людей следуют правилам. В этом и многих других случаях для среднего гражданина правительство остается угрожающим узлом отдельных учреждений и правил.\n\nНо цифровые процессы и веб-образ жизни дают правительству возможность измениться так, чтобы оно было организовано вокруг граждан, а не администрации. Правительства могут предпринять пять основных шагов, чтобы помочь сделать цифровую эпоху реальностью в своих странах. Первые два связаны с улучшением государственных услуг; последние три связаны с созданием инфраструктуры, позволяющей предприятиям страны конкурировать в цифровую эпоху:\n\n1 Поставьте государственных служащих на электронную почту и избавьтесь от бумажной картотеки. Убедитесь, что вся информация внутри правительства является цифровой.\n\n2 Разместите государственные услуги в интернете с интерфейсом, предназначенным для пользователя. Публикуйте все в Интернете.\n\n3 привлечение инвестиций технологическими компаниями и стимулирование электронной коммерции, иногда с финансовой помощью, но чаще с помощью совместных проектов. Создать стандарт электронной идентификации предприятий и граждан.\n\n4 устраните правила, которые мешают индустрии связи эффективно работать. Поощрять крупные инвестиции в инфраструктуру связи.\n\n5 повышение квалификации граждан путем использования технологий в рамках систем образования и профессиональной подготовки на всех уровнях.\n\nПравительство, как и бизнес, может лучше использовать программные средства и электронную почту, чтобы получить гораздо больше выгод от инвестиций в технологии. В развитых странах многие государственные служащие и государственные чиновники уже имеют компьютеры на своих столах, а развивающиеся страны могут создать инфраструктуру ПК за небольшую плату. Использование только электронной почты способствует сотрудничеству между учреждениями и позволяет государственным служащим лучше реагировать на запросы. Некоторые американские политики начинают использовать электронную почту, чтобы поддерживать связь с гражданами, а национальный парламент Австралии использует цифровой рабочий поток, чтобы убедиться, что запросы выполняются.\n\nПравительствам необходимо принять решение об использовании цифровых информационных потоков вместо бумажных. Публикация в интернете должна быть стандартной. Печатные документы должны быть редкостью. Экономия была бы огромной. Только правительство США тратит один миллиард долларов ежегодно на печать документов, которые уже доступны в Интернете. Большинство копий этих документов предназначены для государственных служащих, чьи офисы уже находятся в сети. Большая часть печатных экземпляров оказывается в мусорном баке в столице страны. Веб-публикация всех правительственных документов может снизить затраты и значительно облегчить поиск информации. Цифровые системы также лучше подходят для сложных документов. Правительственное описание транспортного самолета, которое нужно компаниям, если они хотят участвовать в тендере на его строительство, весит больше, чем дом в печатном виде, но данные легко поместятся на пару компакт-дисков.\n\nОнлайн-подход делает больше, чем просто сокращает расходы на бумагу. Веб-технология позволяет правительствам обеспечить единую точку контакта для общественности, единое онлайн - \"лицо\" для структурирования информации в соответствии с тем, что важно для гражданина.\n\nВ некоторых шведских городах, например, веб-страницы организуют различные услуги от различных уровней власти. Граждане могут быстро найти паспортные столы, налоговые органы и офисы национального страхования. Они могут получать отчеты с публичных собраний и другие публичные документы. Они даже могут получать отчеты в режиме реального времени об общественном транспорте, основываясь на электронной информации от транспортных средств, либо используя Интернет, либо киоски. Киоск - это просто компьютер, предназначенный для общественного пользования.\n\nПоскольку интернет обеспечивает наилучший способ взаимодействия с правительством, все граждане должны использовать его, даже если у них самих нет компьютеров. Если электронные киоски, работающие как банковские банкоматы, разместить в почтовых отделениях, библиотеках, школах и других общественных зданиях, они могут помочь правительствам улучшить качество услуг при одновременном снижении стоимости доставки.\n\nОнлайн-системы наиболее полезны для граждан и наиболее эффективны для правительства, когда они имеют более чем одну цель. Правительства должны пересмотреть все свои отношения с гражданами, которые требуют от них стоять в очереди или заполнять бланки. Правительство должно объединить все задействованные ведомства для разработки единой системы управления всеми контактами с гражданами.\n\nИрландское правительство, используя почту, ирландскую почтовую службу, сделало это лучше всего. Почтовые киоски обрабатывают оплату счетов, выдают паспорта, выдают лицензии на транспортные средства, выплачивают пособия, предлагают сберегательные и инвестиционные планы-даже продают марки. Каждый киоск - это крошечная городская ратуша, освещающая работу полудюжины агентств. Поскольку многие из 1000 почтовых отделений An расположены в небольших городах с населением менее 2000 человек, киоски обслуживают 1,26 миллиона человек в неделю-половину населения Ирландии - и обрабатывают более 9 миллиардов долларов в год. Изменить или добавить новые операции очень просто.\n\nДля государственных сделок, подобных этим, как и для всех коммерческих сделок, безопасность имеет важное значение. Безопасность состоит из двух элементов: защита персональных данных во время их перемещения по сети и идентификация лица, осуществляющего операцию. Сегодня существует технология шифрования, которая достаточно сильна, чтобы защитить безопасность любого электронного движения в сети, но американский экспортный контроль над технологией шифрования ограничивает американские фирмы от внедрения ее в свои продукты. Поскольку это не удерживает технологию шифрования от рук преступников, индустрия программного обеспечения работает над тем, чтобы изменить мнение правительства США по этому вопросу. На практике шифрование, которое можно использовать, достаточно сильно, чтобы в большинстве случаев безопасность данных в сети не была слабым звеном. Электронные данные так же безопасны, как и данные в других формах.\n\nИдентификация пользователя не менее важна. Вы же не хотите, чтобы кто-то еще проник в ваши правительственные документы или на ваш банковский счет. Смарт-карты-это решение проблем с идентификацией личности, как и карты для банковских банкоматов. В Испании новая система киосков позволит любому желающему узнать общую информацию о социальных льготах, пройдя через сенсорное меню, но для поиска любой личной информации человеку нужна смарт-карта.\n\nХотя такие карты похожи на банковские карты, используемые во всем мире, некоторые люди обеспокоены тем, что правительство может собрать слишком много информации о гражданах. Некоторые страны имеют законы о конфиденциальности, которые запрещают одной карте или базе данных содержать всю информацию о гражданине, поэтому в некоторых странах будет две карты: одна для финансовых операций с бизнесом или правительством, а другая для здравоохранения.\n\nШироко доступная информация и возможность размещать большое количество информации на смарт-картах заставят общества снова взглянуть на вопрос о том, как можно использовать информацию. Должен ли любой работодатель иметь возможность видеть полицейское досье кандидата на работу? Или просто такие организации, как школы, которые нанимают людей, тесно работающих с детьми? В конце концов, это политические вопросы, а не технологические. Каждая страна должна будет принять решение о том, какие виды личной информации будут разрешены на смарт-картах. Даже если их использование ограничивается только идентификацией личности, повышение эффективности и предотвращение мошенничества стоят вложенных средств. В Лондоне 200 пробных киосков такой системы, как \"Почта\", сократили мошенничество с выплатой пособий на 750 000 фунтов в первый год. При установке во всех 1500 почтовых отделениях киоски, как ожидается, сэкономят 150 миллионов фунтов стерлингов в год.\n\nМенее развитые страны могут считать, что цифровой подход к управлению недосягаем, но страны без систем могут начать все сначала с новой технологии, которая будет дешевле, чем ручной подход. Развитые страны имеют более старые системы,которые часто должны быть объединены.\n\nПримеры со всего мира ясно показывают, что многие из достижений происходят в небольших правительствах-небольших странах и городах, округах и провинциях, а также на государственном уровне больших стран. Меньшие правительства менее сложны, и они могут экспериментировать и разрабатывать решения в меньшем масштабе. Для более крупных правительств урок состоит в том, чтобы начать с небольших проектов, чтобы развить необходимые навыки и посмотреть, как реагируют граждане. Сначала сосредоточьтесь на проектах, которые непосредственно касаются граждан, и особенно на тех, которые избавляют общественность от организационных сложностей.\n\nОкруг Кинг в моем родном штате Вашингтон, вероятно, опережает многие правительства по количеству информации, которую он публикует в интернете,но округ еще не упаковывает информацию или операции просто. Чтобы получить разрешение на строительство в сельской местности округа Кинг, Вы должны получить информацию из многих источников: телефонная книга, телефонные звонки в офис округа, два или три печатных документа и веб-сайт департамента. Единый хорошо структурированный веб-сайт со всей информацией и ссылками, включающими все этапы процесса получения разрешения на строительство, устранит большинство сложностей и может автоматизировать некоторые этапы.\n\nЭкономия от новых цифровых систем составит значительную часть бюджета каждого правительства. Американские военные недавно обнаружили, что они тратят больше денег на обработку и утверждение разрешений на поездки, 2,3 миллиарда долларов, чем на сами поездки, 2 миллиарда долларов. Государственный бюджет США составляет 27 миллиардов долларов на продовольственные талоны, 25 миллиардов долларов на социальные пособия и 13 миллиардов долларов на государственное жилье. Все эти программы имеют чрезвычайно дорогие бумажные административные системы, которые съедают 30 процентов денег. Хорошие цифровые системы могут подтолкнуть это ниже 10 процентов.\n\nГраждане все больше осознают мощь интернета и больше не желают принимать идею о том, что Государственная служба должна быть медленной или запутанной. Ни один клиент не станет стоять в очереди в течение двух часов, чтобы получить обслуживание от частного бизнеса. Почему рабочий должен стоять в очереди в течение двух часов в правительственном офисе и терять два часа зарплаты, когда с помощью интернета он может получить лицензию или оплатить свои гонорары и быть на работе вовремя?\n\nОдно только правительство, создав ключевые сервисы вокруг Интернета, даст большую причину для перехода граждан к веб-образу жизни. Если правительство, как правило, крупнейший \"бизнес\" в любой стране, является лидером в использовании технологий, оно автоматически поднимет технические навыки страны и приведет к переходу на информационный рынок. Построение информационной экономики сделает все компании в стране более конкурентоспособными. Информационный век выигрывает от того, что в него вовлекается больше людей. По мере того как все больше и больше стран присоединяются к этому процессу, его значение возрастает для всех стран. Мировая торговля будет осуществляться в цифровом формате.\n\nНи одно правительство не может сразу внедрить полностью цифровой подход, но каждое правительство может начать сейчас с решительных первых шагов, которые принесут пользу гражданам и заставят их почувствовать, что правительство работает на них. Главный принцип должен заключаться в том, чтобы гражданам никогда больше не приходилось заполнять множество формуляров или ходить во множество мест, чтобы получить информацию.\n\nКак сказал один правительственный чиновник в разговоре о своем новом веб-сайте, который позволяет людям скачивать в интернете столетние записи округа, \"люди могут сказать, когда вы пытаетесь помочь. Они знают разницу между правительственным учреждением, пытающимся им помочь, и тем, которое просто мешает\".\n\nСоздавать сетевые образовательные сообщества.\n\nПК могут дать больше власти учителям и студентам, чем любая другая группа работников умственного труда. Студенты являются чистыми \"работниками знаний\", поскольку обучение-это все о приобретении знаний. Учителя смогут использовать Интернет, чтобы делиться друг с другом и позволить студентам исследовать предмет по-новому. При наличии прочной инфраструктуры некоторые школы уже получают выгоду от использования ПК в классе. Многие школы изо всех сил пытаются найти ресурсы для этих новых инструментов, но умные программы показали, что есть вознаграждение за усилия.\n\nУспех ПК как учебного инструмента требует участия учителя. Без подготовки учителей и превращения ПК в центр учебной программы они не будут иметь большого эффекта. Многие ПК ушли в компьютерные \"лаборатории\", где они сидят, редко используются. Школы должны перейти от рассмотрения ПК как предмета - преподавания технологии-к включению его во все области учебной программы: обучение с использованием технологии. Все больше и больше школ в настоящее время показывают, что ПК, используемые в качестве инструментов обучения, могут оказывать сильное влияние.\n\nВ независимом школьном округе Вестерн-Хайтс, расположенном к западу от Оклахома-Сити, штат Оклахома, учителя были полны энтузиазма, когда округ проводил обучение летом, прежде чем ввести ПК. Более 200 из 230 его учителей записались. Большинство учителей очень любят учиться, и они будут в восторге от всего, что поможет детям учиться. Чего учителя не хотят, так это быть брошенными во что-то, о чем они не имели возможности узнать и освоиться.\n\nВестерн-Хайтс-небольшой семишкольный округ с умеренной налоговой базой для промышленности. Студенческое население представляет собой смесь культур. Около 65 процентов детей имеют право на бесплатные или льготные школьные обеды, потому что они родом из семей с более низкими доходами. Это не тот школьный округ, который, как вы могли бы ожидать, возглавит продвижение в информационную эпоху. Но за последние три года округ трижды голосовал за то, чтобы потратить в общей сложности более 6,8 миллиона долларов местных средств на создание, возможно, ведущей технологической образовательной программы в стране. Сообщество рассматривает инвестиции как единственный способ разорвать порочный круг бедности, который может заманить этих детей в ловушку, если они окажутся неподготовленными к цифровому миру.\n\nПК может стать мощным новым учебным пособием для учителей. Они находят, что могут сделать детей более заинтересованными в уроках, включив фотографии, фильмы и ссылки на интернет-страницы. Один учитель в Вестерн-Хайтс каждый день начинает свой урок со свежих новостей из интернета. Компьютеры - это часть жизни каждого учителя в классе Вестерн Хайтс. Учителя также используют электронную почту для общения друг с другом по общим вопросам. Им не нужно ждать районных собраний, которые проходят пару раз в год. Они могут обратиться к коллегам-учителям с вопросами и быстро получить ответы.\n\n\"Люди могут не осознавать, насколько одиноки учителя в классе\", - говорит Джо Китченс из отдела школ в Вестерн-Хайтс. - Большинство учителей целыми днями остаются за закрытыми дверями. У них мало времени для обмена опытом или взаимодействия с другими учителями. Есть только несколько раз в году, когда они могут собраться вместе. Электронная почта останавливает их изоляцию\". Он также шутит, что учителя могут жаловаться ему больше, чем раньше. Они ожидают, что он немедленно ответит на их вопросы по электронной почте.\n\nВажным способом использования преимуществ инвестиций в технологии является использование школьной инфраструктуры на благо всего общества. Базовые компьютерные навыки - это один из видов образования, который может быть применен в любой работе. В большинстве стран одна из каждых десяти вакансий в сфере информационных технологий (ИТ) не заполнена. В ближайшие несколько лет Соединенным Штатам и Европе потребуется более полумиллиона новых обученных ИТ-специалистов. Быстро развивающиеся регионы, такие как Индия и Латинская Америка, могут испытывать больший дефицит.\n\nСредняя школа в Рединге, Англия, оплачивает инфраструктуру, в которой она нуждается, за счет сочетания частных и государственных денег. Старшая школа ожидает, что сообщество внесет свой вклад. Взрослые могут получить онлайн-техническую подготовку либо в школах чтения, которые открываются для этой цели по вечерам и выходным, либо дома. Плата за эту услугу идет на поддержание и расширение ИТ-системы.\n\nБольшинство работников умственного труда в Соединенных Штатах имеют свой собственный компьютер, но даже в лучших школах на каждый компьютер обычно приходится более семи учеников. Для школ дорого покупать компьютеры для каждого ученика, особенно когда компьютеры устаревают каждые три года или около того. По этой причине существует опасение, что разрыв между \" имущими \"-теми семьями, которые могут позволить себе ПК дома, и\"неимущими\" -теми, кто не может позволить себе ПК дома,-создаст серьезный разрыв в возможностях. Творческие подходы в предоставлении ПК каждому студенту начинают помогать решать эту проблему.\n\nОдин проект был начат в начале 1990-х годов в Мельбурне, Австралия, где Брюс Диксон, учитель, интересующийся технологиями, увидел значительные различия в результатах преподавания, когда он мог использовать полдюжины компьютеров для своих занятий вместо одного. Он понял, что для достижения наилучших результатов учащиеся должны использовать ПК в качестве инструмента для всей своей работы - во всех классах и дома, а также в школе.\n\nИз многих встреч возникла идея, чтобы все студенты финансировали свои собственные машины. Диксон, к тому времени уже консультант по технологиям, разработал финансовый план. За ежемесячную плату студенты получают машину и программное обеспечение. Продавец оказывает услуги, а когда студент заканчивает учебу, машина остается у семьи. Все еще трудно всем семьям позволить себе такие сборы. Более состоятельные семьи могут позволить себе типичную ежемесячную плату в сорок долларов в течение трех лет. Многие семьи могут позволить себе заплатить небольшую сумму. Бизнес и общественные организации могут компенсировать разницу. Какой бы ни была сумма, семейный вклад является основным для этой программы, поскольку он дает студентам и их родителям чувство владения и ответственности за компьютер и за его роль в образовании студентов.\n\nПодобные программы распространились на школы по всему миру. Эффект был впечатляющим. Недавний отчет показывает, что студенты, которые регулярно используют компьютеры, приобретают много навыков. Они пишут чаще и лучше; у них лучше навыки анализа; они выражают себя более творчески; они работают более независимо, и они лучше решают проблемы и критическое мышление.\n\nОдна из самых перспективных идей заключается в том, чтобы использовать ПК, чтобы предложить различные способы обучения. Около пятидесяти различных основных теорий пытаются описать индивидуальные стили обучения. Большинство теорий идентифицируют сходные качества. Проще говоря, некоторые люди учатся лучше, читая, некоторые слушая, некоторые наблюдая, как кто-то другой выполняет задание, некоторые выполняя задание. Большинство из нас учится с помощью сочетания всех этих методов. И все люди имеют разные уровни способностей, разные личности и жизненный опыт, которые влияют на то, насколько хорошо они учатся. Новое программное обеспечение помогает студентам учиться, независимо от их стиля обучения или способностей. Программное обеспечение может представлять информацию во многих различных формах, которые могут быть адаптированы к индивидуальному студенту гораздо легче, чем бумажные методы.\n\nПК могут помочь изменить опыт обучения от традиционного подхода-учитель говорит перед классом, с заданиями на чтение-к более практическому подходу, который использует естественное любопытство студентов всех возрастов. ПК позволяют учащимся изучать информацию с их собственной скоростью, учиться на звуке и изображениях, а также на тексте, проводить эксперименты и работать вместе с другими учащимися.\n\nПК являются основными инструментами для работы и общения в цифровую эпоху. Компьютер и интернет полностью меняют одно: они обеспечивают каждого ученика в каждой школе и сообществе информацией и способами работы, которые до сих пор были недоступны даже ученикам лучших школ. Педагоги воспользуются этим, чтобы помочь своим общинам. ПК-это новый инструмент преподавания и обучения, и преподаватели, которые используют их, будут агентами перемен.\n\nГлава пятая.\n\nОжидайте неожиданного.\n\nГотовьтесь к цифровому будущему.\n\nКлиенты-это основные люди, которые получают выгоду от повышения эффективности информационных технологий, и эти выгоды будут увеличиваться по мере того, как экономика становится все более цифровой. Другие люди, которые выигрывают, - это бизнесмены, которые используют цифровые методы быстрее, чем их конкуренты. Решения, о которых я говорил в этой книге, являются результатом видения и лидерства деловых людей, которые использовали его, чтобы лучше обслуживать своих клиентов.\n\nБизнес-лидеры, добившиеся успеха, воспользуются преимуществами нового способа ведения бизнеса, основанного на растущей скорости распространения информации. Новый способ заключается не в том, чтобы применять технологию ради нее самой, а в том, чтобы использовать ее для изменения поведения компаний. Чтобы в полной мере воспользоваться преимуществами технологий, бизнес-лидеры сделают свои процессы и организации проще и современнее. Цель состоит в том, чтобы сделать реакцию бизнеса почти мгновенной и сделать стратегическое мышление процессом, который происходит постоянно, а не чем - то, что делается каждые двенадцать-восемнадцать месяцев, отдельно от ежедневного потока бизнеса.\n\nНовая технология должна предоставлять лучшую информацию каждому работнику, который может ее использовать. Работники умственного труда-это мозги компании. Если они отключены от важных данных компании, как они могут работать, как они могут взять на себя ответственность? Вы можете давать людям задания и полномочия, но без информации они ничего не смогут сделать. Знание-лучший инструмент власти. Если важная информация о производственных системах, проблемах продукта, кризисах и возможностях клиентов, потерянных продажах и других важных деловых новостях проходит через организацию в течение нескольких минут, а не дней, и если правильные люди могут работать над проблемами в течение нескольких часов, а не дней, бизнес получает огромное преимущество. Это изменение в структуре процессов является более важным, чем любое другое изменение со времен массового производства.\n\nКаждая компания может выбрать, быть ли ей лидером или следовать цифровым тенденциям. Интернет меняет основу отраслей в реальном времени. Победить нелегко. Цифровой информационный поток и предоставление власти сотрудникам - это часть достижения и поддержания конкурентного преимущества. Вера в то, что люди наделены властью, является ключом к получению максимальной отдачи от цифровой нервной системы. Работники умственного труда и бизнес-менеджеры получают больше и лучше информации, а не только высшее руководство. Когда сотрудники получают пару хороших инструментов, которые дают лучшие результаты, они требуют больше. Это позитивный цикл.\n\nКак бы вы ни организовывали свою компанию, ясно одно: полностью управлять компанией из центра невозможно. Невозможно, чтобы один человек или группа людей оставались в курсе всех вопросов в каждой области бизнеса. Лидеры должны обеспечивать планирование и руководство, а также предоставлять сотрудникам инструменты, позволяющие им собирать информацию и понимание со всего мира. Компании, которые пытаются направлять каждое действие из центра, просто не смогут двигаться достаточно быстро, чтобы справиться со скоростью новой экономики.\n\nВ бизнесе спор между центральной властью и индивидуумом заключается в различии между старым стилем мышления, который рассматривал рабочих как ленивых людей, нуждающихся в контроле, и теорией о том, что рабочие являются творческими и должны нести ответственность. Цифровые процессы поддерживают идею о том, что работники могут - и будут - делать больше, если им позволят, позволят и поощрят думать и действовать.\n\nЭтот спор о центре и индивидууме не просто академический. Выбор влияет на дизайн компаний и систем. Конструкция первого пилотируемого космического корабля потрясла первых пилотов много лет назад. Ручного управления полетом не было. Не волнуйтесь, сказали ученые. Система будет управлять кораблем. Пилоты, как и обезьяны до них, были там только для поездки. Пилоты сопротивлялись. Все они имели опыт работы с \"продвинутыми\" системами, которые выходили из строя, когда становилось трудно. Пилоты победили, и в нескольких полетах мастерство пилотов благополучно доставило их домой, когда центральная запрограммированная система отказала. Вопрос не в том, могут ли компьютеры летать лучше пилотов. Сегодня самолеты и космические корабли используют большое количество компьютерных технологий для расширения возможностей человека летать. Вопрос в том, может ли кто - то \"в центре\", вдали от реальных обстоятельств, предсказать все, что может измениться или пойти не так-будь то в космосе или в деловом офисе.\n\nМногие части бизнеса могут быть улучшены с помощью цифровых систем, но потребуется много лет, чтобы улучшить каждую отдельную часть. Каждый бит данных в компании должен быть в цифровой форме, и его легко найти, включая каждый файл, каждую запись, каждый фрагмент электронной почты, каждую веб-страницу. Каждый внутренний процесс должен быть цифровым и связанным с любым другим процессом. Каждая операция с партнерами и клиентами должна быть цифровой. Вы должны позволить партнерам и клиентам иметь все данные, которые им подходят, и они должны сделать то же самое для вас.\n\nЛюди-не самые большие животные, не самые сильные и быстрые, не самые острые на вид и обоняние. Мы выжили и добились успеха благодаря своему мозгу. Мы научились пользоваться инструментами, строить жилища, изобретать сельское хозяйство, держать сельскохозяйственных животных, развивать цивилизацию и культуру, лечить и предотвращать болезни. Наши инструменты и технологии помогли нам сформировать окружающую среду.\n\nЯ позитивный человек. Я верю в прогресс. Я бы предпочел остаться в живых сегодня, чем когда - либо в истории-и не только потому, что в более ранние времена мои навыки не были бы столь ценны, и я был бы хорошим кандидатом на обед животного. Орудия индустриальной эпохи расширили возможности наших мышц. Инструменты цифровой эпохи расширяют возможности нашего разума. Я еще счастливее за своих детей, которые вырастут в этом новом мире.\n\nС энтузиазмом вступая в цифровую эпоху, мы можем ускорить положительные эффекты и лучше справляться с такими проблемами, как конфиденциальность и проблема \"имущих\" и \"неимущих\". Если мы будем сидеть сложа руки и ждать, пока цифровой век придет к нам на условиях, определенных другими, мы не сможем сделать ни того, ни другого. Веб-образ жизни может повысить вовлеченность граждан в управление государством. Многие решения, которые необходимо принять, носят политический и социальный характер, а не технический. Они включают в себя то, как мы делаем так, чтобы каждый мог попасть в Интернет, и как мы защищаем детей. Граждане любой культуры должны присоединиться к дискуссии о влиянии цифровых технологий, чтобы убедиться, что новая цифровая эпоха отражает общество, которое они хотят создать.\n\nЦифровой мир, конечно, делает его жестким и неопределенным для бизнеса, но мы все выиграем. Мы получим улучшенные продукты и услуги, лучшие ответы на жалобы, более низкие затраты и больше возможностей выбора. Мы получим лучшие государственные и социальные услуги, которые будут стоить намного дешевле. Этот мир приближается. Большая часть этого происходит благодаря бизнесу, использующему цифровую нервную систему для улучшения своих процессов. Цифровая нервная система может помочь бизнесу определить себя и свою роль в будущем, но успех или неудача зависят от лидеров бизнеса. Только вы можете подготовить свою организацию и инвестировать таким образом, чтобы воспользоваться преимуществами быстро наступающего цифрового века.\n\nЦифровые инструменты расширяют возможности, которые делают нас уникальными в мире: способность думать, способность выражать свои мысли, способность работать вместе, чтобы действовать в соответствии с этими мыслями. Я твердо верю, что если компании дадут своим сотрудникам возможность решать проблемы и дадут им мощные инструменты для этого, они всегда будут поражены тем, как много творческого и независимого мышления появится.",

        "lev": "B",
        "en": "Mister and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense.\n\nMister Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\n\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\n\nWhen Mister and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mister Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\n\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\n\nAt half past eight, Mister Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.\n\n“Little tyke,” chortled Mister Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s drive.\n\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar, a cat reading a map. For a second, Mister Dursley didn’t realize what he had seen, then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mister Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mister Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive, no, looking  at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mister Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mister Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes, the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mister Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mister Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt, these people were obviously collecting for something … yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mister Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\n\nMister Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He  didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mister Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\n\nHe’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.\n\n“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard, ”\n\n“, yes, their son, Harry, ”\n\nMister Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.\n\nHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking … no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was  called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn’t blame her, if he’d  had a sister like that … but all the same, those people in cloaks …\n\nHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.\n\n“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mister Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day”!\n\nAnd the old man hugged Mister Dursley around the middle and walked off.\n\nMister Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of imagination.\n\nAs he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw, and it didn’t improve his mood, was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\n\n“Shoo”! said Mister Dursley loudly.\n\nThe cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mister Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.\n\nMrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs Next Door’s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (“Won’t”!). Mister Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:\n\n“And finally, bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern”. The newscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim”?\n\n“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early, it’s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight”.\nMister Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters.\n\nMrs Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er, Petunia, dear, you haven’t heard from your sister lately, have you”?\n\nAs he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a sister.\n\n“No,” she said sharply. “Why”?\n\n“Funny stuff on the news,” Mister Dursley mumbled. “Owls, shooting stars, and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today”.\n\n“So ”? snapped Mrs Dursley.\n\n“Well, I just thought, maybe, it was something to do with, you know, her  crowd”.\n\nMrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mister Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name “Potter”. He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son, he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he”?\n\n“I suppose so,” said Mrs Dursley stiffly.\n\n“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it”?\n\n“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me”.\n\n“Oh, yes,” said Mister Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. “Yes, I quite agree”.\n\nHe didn’t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mister Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.\n\nWas he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did, if it got out that they were related to a pair of, well, he didn’t think he could bear it.\n\nThe Dursleys got into bed. Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mister Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were  involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind., He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on, he yawned and turned over, it couldn’t affect them, .\n\nHow very wrong he was.\n\nMister Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\n\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\n\nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known”.\n\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again, the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady eyed Mrs Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.\n\n“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall”.\n\nHe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\n\n“How did you know it was me”? she asked.\n\n“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly”.\n\n“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said Professor McGonagall.\n\n“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here”.\n\nProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\n\n“Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,” she said impatiently. “You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no, even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was on their news”. She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark living room window. “I heard it. Flocks of owls, shooting stars., Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent, I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense”.\n\n“You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. “We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years”.\n\n“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “But that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors”.\n\nShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has  gone, Dumbledore”?\n\n“It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop”?\n\n“A what ”?\n\n“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of”.\n\n“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn’t think this was the moment for lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who has  gone, ”\n\n“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this ‘You-Know-Who’ nonsense, for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort ”. Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ‘You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name”.\n\n“I know you haven’t”, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know, oh, all right, Voldemort , was frightened of”.\n\n“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had powers I will never have”.\n\n“Only because you’re too, well, noble  to use them”.\n\n“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs”.\n\nProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to the rumors  that are flying around. You know what everyone’s saying? About why he’s disappeared? About what finally stopped him”?\n\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\n\n“What they’re saying ,” she pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are, are, that they’re, dead ”.\n\nDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\n\n“Lily and James, I can’t believe it, I didn’t want to believe it, Oh, Albus”.\n\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. “I know, I know”. he said heavily.\n\nProfessor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on. “That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potter’s son, Harry. But, he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke, and that’s why he’s gone”.\n\nDumbledore nodded glumly.\n\n“It’s, it’s true ”? faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s done, all the people he’s killed, he couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s just astounding, of all the things to stop him, but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive”?\n\n“We can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “We may\n\nnever know”.\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by the way”?\n\n“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t suppose you’re going to tell me why  you’re here, of all places”?\n\n“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the only family he has left now”.\n\n“You don’t mean, you can’t  mean the people who live here ”? cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. “Dumbledore, you can’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t find two people who are less like us. And they’ve got this son, I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here”!\n\n“It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly. “His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he’s older. I’ve written them a letter”.\n\n“A letter”? repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. “Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He’ll be famous, a legend, I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future, there will be books written about Harry, every child in our world will know his name”!\n\n“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses. “It would be enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even remember! Can’t you see how much better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take it”?\n\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes, yes, you’re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore”? She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\n\n“Hagrid’s bringing him”.\n\n“You think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this”?\n\n“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore.\n\n“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t pretend he’s not careless. He does tend to, what was that”?\n\nA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky, and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.\n\nIf the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild , long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.\n\n“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At last. And where did you get that motorcycle”?\n\n“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him, sir”.\n\n“No problems, were there”?\n\n“No, sir, house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we were flyin’ over Bristol”.\n\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.\n\n“Is that where, ”? whispered Professor McGonagall.\n\n“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He’ll have that scar forever”.\n\n“Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore”?\n\n“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well, give him here, Hagrid, we’d better get this over with”.\n\nDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.\n\n“Could I, could I say good bye to him, sir”? asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.\n\n“Shhh”! hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the Muggles”!\n\n“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. “But I c-c-can’t stand it, Lily an’ James dead, an’ poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles, ”\n\n“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.\n\n“Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations”.\n\n“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’ll be takin’ Sirius his bike back. G’night, Professor McGonagall, Professor Dumbledore, sir”.\n\nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.\n\n“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\n\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\n\n“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.\n\nA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley. He couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter, the boy who lived”!\n\n2: THE VANISHING GLASS.\n\nNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys’ front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mister Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different colored bonnets, but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\n\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.\n\n“Up! Get up! Now”!\n\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.\n\n“Up”! she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the same dream before.\n\nHis aunt was back outside the door.\n\n“Are you up yet”? she demanded.\n\n“Nearly,” said Harry.\n\n“Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don’t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy’s birthday”.\n\nHarry groaned.\n\n“What did you say”? his aunt snapped through the door.\n\n“Nothing, nothing”.\n\nDudley’s birthday, how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\n\nWh\n\nen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise, unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, but he was very fast.\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.\n\n“In the car crash when your parents died,” she had said. “And don’t ask questions”.\n\nDon’t ask questions , that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.\n\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.\n\n“Comb your hair”! he barked, by way of a morning greeting.\n\nAbout once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way, all over the place.\n\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel, Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.\n\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn’t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell.\n\n“Thirty six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father. “That’s two less than last year”.\n\n“Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, see, it’s here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy”.\n\n“All right, thirty seven then,” said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.\n\nAunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, “And we’ll buy you another two  presents while we’re out today. How’s that, popkin? Two  more presents. Is that all right”?\n\nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, “So I’ll have thirty, thirty”.\n\n“Thirty nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia.\n\n“Oh”. Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. “All right then”.\n\nUncle Vernon chuckled. “Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his father. ’Atta boy, Dudley”! He ruffled Dudley’s hair.\n\nAt that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.\n\n“Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs Figg’s broken her leg. She can’t take him”. She jerked her head in Harry’s direction.\n\nDudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley’s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned.\n\n“Now what”? said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he’d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mister Paws, and Tufty again.\n\n“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested.\n\n“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy”.\n\nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn’t there, or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a slug.\n\n“What about what’s her name, your friend, Yvonne”?\n\n“On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia.\n\n“You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully (he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s computer).\n\nAunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a lemon.\n\n“And come back and find the house in ruins”? she snarled.\n\n“I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry, but they weren’t listening.\n\n“I suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said Aunt Petunia slowly, “and leave him in the car”.\n\n“That car’s new, he’s not sitting in it alone”.\n\nDudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn’t really crying, it had been years since he’d really cried, but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.\n\n“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him spoil your special day”! she cried, flinging her arms around him.\n\n“I, don’t, want, him, t-t-to come”! Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. “He always sp-spoils everything”! He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother’s arms.\n\nJust then, the doorbell rang, “Oh, good Lord, they’re here”! said Aunt Petunia frantically, and a moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.\n\nHalf an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.\n\n“I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry’s, “I’m warning you now, boy, any funny business, anything at all, and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas”.\n\n“I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly”.\n\nBut Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him. No one ever did.\n\nThe problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn’t make them happen.\n\nOnce, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar”. Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn’t  explain how it had grown back so quickly.\n\nAnother time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn’t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn’t punished.\n\nOn the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry’s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.\n\nBut today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn’t school, his cupboard, or Mrs Figg’s cabbage smelling living room.\n\nWhile he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.\n\n“roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,” he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.\n\n“I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry, remembering suddenly. “It was flying”.\n\nUncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DON’T FLY”!\n\nDudley and Piers sniggered.\n\n“I know they don’t,” said Harry. “It was only a dream”.\n\nBut he wished he hadn’t\n\nsaid anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon, they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.\nIt was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn’t blond.\n\nHarry had the best morning he’d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.\n\nHarry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.\n\nAfter lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can, but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\n\nDudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.\n\n“Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge.\n\n“Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.\n\n“This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.\n\nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself, no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.\n\nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s.\n\nIt winked. \n\nHarry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\n\nThe snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:\n\n“I get that all the time. ”\n\n“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying”.\n\nThe snake nodded vigorously.\n\n“Where do you come from, anyway”? Harry asked.\n\nThe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.\n\nBoa Constrictor, Brazil.\n\n“Was it nice there”?\n\nThe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo.  “Oh, I see, so you’ve never been to Brazil”?\n\nAs the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump.\n\n“DUDLEY! MR DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING”!\n\nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.\n\n“Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened, one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.\n\nHarry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.\n\nAs the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come., Thanksss, amigo”.\n\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock.\n\n“But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go”?\n\nThe zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry”?\n\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go, cupboard, stay, no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.\n\nHarry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn’t know what time it was and he couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.\n\nHe’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn’t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn’t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.\n\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.\n\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang.\nThe escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.\n\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\n\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.\n\n“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,” he told Harry. “Want to come upstairs and practice”?\n\n“No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had anything as horrible as your head down it, it might be sick”. Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he’d said.\n\nOne day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs Figg’s. Mrs Figg wasn’t as bad as usual. It turned out she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for several years.\n\nThat evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand new uniform. Smeltings’ boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren’t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.\n\nAs he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown up. Harry didn’t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.\nThere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.\n\n“What’s this”? he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.\n\n“Your new school uniform,” she said.\n\nHarry looked in the bowl again.\n\n“Oh,” he said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet”.\n\n“Don’t be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing some of Dudley’s old things gray for you. It’ll look just like everyone else’s when I’ve finished”.\n\nHarry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High, like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.\n\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry’s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.\n\nThey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.\n\n“Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.\n\n“Make Harry get it”.\n\n“Get the mail, Harry”.\n\n“Make Dudley get it”.\n\n“Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley”.\n\nHarry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and, a letter for Harry. Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives, he didn’t belong to the library, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:\n\nMister Harry Potter,\n\nThe Cupboard under the Stairs,\n\n4 Privet Drive,\n\nLittle Whinging,\n\nSurrey.\n\nThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald green ink. There was no stamp.\n\nTurning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H\n\n“Hurry up, boy”! shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. “What are you doing, checking for letter bombs”? He chuckled at his own joke.\n\nHarry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.\n\nUncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.\n\n“Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny whelk”.\n\n“Dad”! said Dudley suddenly. “Dad, Harry’s got something”!\n\nHarry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.\n\n“That’s mine”! said Harry, trying to snatch it back.\n\n“Who’d be writing to you”? sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn’t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.\n\n“P-P-Petunia”! he gasped.\n\nDudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.\n\n“Vernon! Oh my goodness, Vernon”!\n\nThey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn’t used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.\n\n“I want to read that letter,” he said loudly.\n\n“I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine”.\n\n“Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.\n\nHarry didn’t move.\n\n“I WANT MY LETTER”! he shouted.\n\n“Let me see it”! demanded Dudley.\n\n“OUT”! roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.\n\n“Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, “look at the address, how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don’t think they’re watching the house”?\n\n“Watching, spying, might be following us,” muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.\n\n“But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don’t want, ”\n\nHarry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.\n\n“No,” he said finally. “No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t get an answer, Yes, that’s best ; we won’t do anything; ”.\n\n“But, ”\n\n“I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we swear when we took him in we’d stamp out that dangerous nonsense”?\n\nThat evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he’d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.\n\n“Where’s my letter”? said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. “Who’s writing to me”?\n\n“No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,” said Uncle Vernon shortly. “I have burned it”.\n\n“It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my cupboard on it”.\n\n“SILENCE”! yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.\n\n“Er, yes, Harry, about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking ; you’re really getting a bit big for it ; we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley’s second bedroom”.\n\n“Why”? said Harry.\n\n“Don’t ask questions”! snapped his uncle. “Take this stuff upstairs, now”.\n\nThe Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor’s dog; in the corner was Dudley’s first ever television set, which he’d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they’d never been touched.\n\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, “I don’t want him in there ; I need that room ; make him get out; ”.\n\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he’d have given anything to be up here. Today he’d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.\n\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn’t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.\n\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, “There’s another one! ‘Mr. H Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive, ’”\n\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in his hand.\n\n“Go to your cupboard, I mean, your bedroom,” he wheezed at Harry. “Dudley, go, just go”.\n\nHarry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first letter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this time he’d make sure they didn’t fail. He had a plan.\n\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn’t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.\n\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door, \n\n“AAAAARRRGH”!\n\nHarry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat, something alive!\n\nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.\n\n“I want, ” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.\n\nUncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.\n\n“See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver them they’ll just give up”.\n\n“I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon”.\n\n“Oh, these people’s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.\n\nOn Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn’t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.\n\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” as he worked, and jumped at small noises.\n\nOn Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.\n\n“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly”? Dudley asked Harry in amazement.\nOn Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.\n\n“No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, “no damn letters today.”\n\nSomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one, \n\n“Out! OUT”!\n\nUncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.\n\n“That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. “I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments”!\n\nHe looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.\n\nThey drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.\n\n“Shake ’em off ; shake ’em off,” he would mutter whenever he did this.\n\nThey didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He’d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he’d missed five television programs he’d wanted to see, and he’d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.\n\nUncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering; .\n\nThey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.\n\n“’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr H Potter? Only I got about an ’undred of these at the front desk”.\n\nShe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:\n\nMister Harry Potter,\n\nRoom 17,\n\nRailview Hotel,\n\nCokeworth.\n\nHarry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.\n\n“I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.\n“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear”? Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.\n\n“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he”? Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.\n\nIt started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled.\n\n“It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great Humberto’s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television”.\n\nMonday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday, and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television, then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun, last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, you weren’t eleven every day.\n\nUncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he’d bought.\n\n“Found the perfect place”! he said. “Come on! Everyone out”!\n\nIt was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.\n\n“Storm forecast for tonight”! said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. “And this gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat”!\n\nA toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron gray water below them.\n\n“I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, “so all aboard”!\n\nIt was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken down house.\n\nThe inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.\n\nUncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.\n\n“Could do with some of those letters now, eh”? he said cheerfully.\n\nHe was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn’t cheer him up at all.\n\nAs night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.\n\nThe storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn’t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley’s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.\n\nFive minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he’d be able to steal one somehow.\n\nThree minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?\n\nOne minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds ; twenty ; ten ; nine, maybe he’d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him, three ; two ; one ;\n\nBOOM.\n\nThe whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.\n\nBOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. “Where’s the cannon”? he said stupidly.\n\nThere was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands, now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.\n\n“Who’s there”? he shouted. “I warn you, I’m armed”!\n\nThere was a pause. Then, \n\nSMASH!\n\nThe door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.\n\nA giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.\n\nThe giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.\n\n“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not been an easy journey . . ”.\n\nHe strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.\n\n“Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger.\n\nDudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.\n\n“An’ here’s Harry”! said the giant.\n\nHarry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.\n\n“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the giant. “Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer mom’s eyes”.\n\nUncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.\n\n“I demand that you leave at once, sir”! he said. “You are breaking and entering”!\n\n“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.\n\nUncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.\n\n“Anyway, Harry,” said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here, I mighta sat on it at some point, but it’ll taste all right”.\n\nFrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.\n\nHarry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you”?\n\nThe giant chuckled.\n\n“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts”.\n\nHe held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.\n\n“What about that tea then, eh”? he said, rubbing his hands together. “I’d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind”.\n\nHis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn’t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he’d sunk into a hot bath.\n\nThe giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t touch anything he gives you, Dudley”.\n\nThe giant chuckled darkly.\n\n“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’ worry”.\n\nHe passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are”.\n\nThe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.\n\n“Call me Hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. An’ like I told yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts, yeh’ll know all about Hogwarts, o’ course”.\n\n“Er, no,” said Harry.\n\nHagrid looked shocked.\n\n“Sorry,” Harry said quickly.\n\n“Sorry”? barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. “It’s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren’t gettin’ yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even know abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yet parents learned it all”?\n\n“All what”? asked Harry.\n\n“ALL WHAT”? Hagrid thundered. “Now wait jus’ one second”!\n\nHe had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.\n\n“Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the Dursleys, “that this boy, this boy!, knows nothin’ abou’, about ANYTHING”?\n\nHarry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren’t bad.\n\n“I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do math and stuff”. But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents’ world”.\n\n“What world”?\n\nHagrid looked as if he was about to explode.\n\n“DURSLEY”! he boomed.\n\nUncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like “Mimblewimble”. Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.\n\n“But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he said. “I mean, they’re famous. You’re famous”.\n\n“What? My, my mom and dad weren’t famous, were they”?\n\n“Yeh don’ know ; yeh don’ know . . ”. Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.\n\n“Yeh don’ know what yeh are”? he said finally.\n\nUncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.\n\n“Stop”! he commanded. “Stop right there, sit! I forbid you to tell the boy anything”!\n\nA braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.\n\n“You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An’ you’ve kept it from him all these years”?\n\n“Kept what from me”? said Harry eagerly.\n\n“STOP! I FORBID YOU”! yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.\n\nAunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.\n\n“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Harry, yer a wizard”.\n\nThere was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.\n\n“I’m a what”? gasped Harry.\n\n“A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’ a thumpin’ good ’un, I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read yer letter”.\n\nHarry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr H Potter, The Floor, Hut on the Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:\n\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY.\n\nHeadmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE.\n\n(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed of Wizards).\n\nDear Mr Potter,\n\nWe are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.\n\nTerm begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMinerva McGonagall,\n\nDeputy Headmistress.\n\nQuestions exploded inside Harry’s head like fireworks and he couldn’t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, “What does it mean, they await my owl”?\n\n“Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl, a real, live, rather ruffled looking owl, a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:\n\nDear Professor Dumbledore,\n\nGiven Harry his letter.\n\nTaking him to buy his things tomorrow.\n\nWeather’s horrible. Hope you’re well, Hagrid.\n\nHagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.\n\nHarry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.\n\n“Where was I”? said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.\n\n“He’s not going,” he said.\n\nHagrid grunted.\n\n“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he said.\n\n“A what”? said Harry, interested.\n\n“A Muggle,” said Hagrid, “it’s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on”.\n\n“We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed”!\n\n“You knew”? said Harry. “You knew I’m a, a wizard”?\n\n“Knew”! shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. “Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that, that school, and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was, a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family”!\n\nShe stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.\n\n“Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you’d be just the same, just as strange, just as, as, abnormal, and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you”!\n\nHarry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, “Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash”!\n\n“CAR CRASH”! roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. “How could a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter? It’s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin’ his own story when every kid in our world knows his name”!\n\n“But why? What happened”? Harry asked urgently.\n\nThe anger faded from Hagrid’s face. He looked suddenly anxious.\n\n“I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried voice. “I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much yeh didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right person ter tell yeh, but someone’s gotta, yeh can’t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’”.\n\nHe threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.\n\n“Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh, mind, I can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, parts of it; ”.\n\nHe sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, “It begins, I suppose, with, with a person called, but it’s incredible yeh don’t know his name, everyone in our world knows, ”\n\n“Who”?\n\n“Well, I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No one does”.\n\n“Why not”?\n\n“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went ; bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was . . ”.\n\nHagrid gulped, but no words came out.\n\n“Could you write it down”? Harry suggested.\n\n“Nah can’t spell it. All right, Voldemort”. Hagrid shuddered. “Don’t make me say it again. Anyway, this, this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin’ fer followers. Got ’em, too, some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o’ his power, ’cause he was gettin’ himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches ; terrible things happened. He was takin’ over. ’Course, some stood up to him, an’ he killed ’em. Horribly. One o’ the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn’t dare try takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway.\n\n“Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an’ girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst’ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get ’em on his side before ; probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side.\n\n“Maybe he thought he could persuade ’em ; maybe he just wanted ’em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an’, an’, ”\n\nHagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.\n\n“Sorry,” he said. “But it’s that sad, knew yer mum an’ dad, an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t find, anyway; .\n\n“You-Know-Who killed ’em. An’ then, an’ this is the real myst’ry of the thing, he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh, took care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even, but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ’em, no one except you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the best witches an’ wizards of the age, the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts, an’ you was only a baby, an’ you lived”.\n\nSomething very painful was going on in Harry’s mind. As Hagrid’s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before, and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.\n\nHagrid was watching him sadly.\n\n“Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore’s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot . . ”.\n\n“Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.\n\n“Now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “I accept there’s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured, and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off without them in my opinion, asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types, just what I expected, always knew they’d come to a sticky end, ”\n\nBut at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, “I’m warning you, Dursley, I’m warning you, one more word . . ”.\n\nIn danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent.\n\n“That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.\n\nHarry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.\n\n“But what happened to Vol, , sorry, I mean, You-Know-Who”?\n\n“Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see ; he was gettin’ more an’ more powerful, why’d he go?\n\n“Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I don’ believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of ’em came outta kinda trances. Don’ reckon they could’ve done if he was comin’ back.\n\n“Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. ’Cause somethin’ about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on, I dunno what it was, no one does, but somethin’ about you stumped him, all right”.\n\nHagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He’d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn’t they been turned into warty toads every time they’d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he’d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football?\n\n“Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard”.\n\nTo his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.\n\n“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry”?\n\nHarry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it ; every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry ; chased by Dudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach ; dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow back ; and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him?\n\nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.\n\n“See”? said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard, you wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts”.\n\nBut Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight.\n\n“Haven’t I told you he’s not going”? he hissed. “He’s going to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish, spell books and wands and, ”\n\n“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop him,” growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name’s been down ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won’t know himself. He’ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled, ”\n\n“I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS”! yelled Uncle Vernon.\n\nBut he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, “NEVER,” he thundered, “, INSULT, ALBUS, DUMBLEDORE, IN, FRONT, OF, ME”!\n\nHe brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley, there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.\n\nUncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.\n\nHagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.\n\n“Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it didn’t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn’t much left ter do”.\n\nHe cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.\n\n“Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,” he said. “I’m, er, not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin’. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff, one o’ the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job, ”\n\n“Why aren’t you supposed to do magic”? asked Harry.\n\n“Oh, well, I was at Hogwarts meself but I, er, got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an’ everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore”.\n\n“Why were you expelled”?\n\n“It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” said Hagrid loudly. “Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an’ that”.\n\nHe took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.\n\n“You can kip under that,” he said. “Don’ mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o’ dormice in one o’ the pockets”.\n\nHarry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.\n\n“It was a dream,” he told himself firmly. “I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll be at home in my cupboard”.\n\nThere was suddenly a loud tapping noise.\n\nAnd there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn’t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.\n\nTap Tap Tap\n\n“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up”.\n\nHe sat up and Hagrid’s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak.\n\nHarry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn’t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid’s coat.\n\n“Don’t do that”.\n\nHarry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.\n\n“Hagrid”! said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl, ”\n\n“Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa.\n\n“What”?\n\n“He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the pockets”.\n\nHagrid’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets, bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags ; finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange looking coins.\n\n“Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily.\n\n“Knuts”?\n\n“The little bronze ones”.\n\nHarry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window.\n\nHagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.\n\n“Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’ buy all yer stuff fer school”.\n\nHarry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.\n\n“Um, Hagrid”?\n\n“Mm”? said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.\n\n“I haven’t got any money, and you heard Uncle Vernon last night ; he won’t pay for me to go and learn magic”.\n\n“Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. “D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave yeh anything”?\n\n“But if their house was destroyed, ”\n\n“They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a sausage, they’re not bad cold, an’ I wouldn’ say no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither”.\n\n“Wizards have banks”?\n\n“Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins”.\n\nHarry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.\n\n“Goblins”?\n\n“Yeah, so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe, ’cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’ fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business”. Hagrid drew himself up proudly. “He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin’ you gettin’ things from Gringotts, knows he can trust me, see.\n\n“Got everythin’? Come on, then”.\n\nHarry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.\n\n“How did you get here”? Harry asked, looking around for another boat.\n\n“Flew,” said Hagrid.\n\n“Flew”?\n\n“Yeah, but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve got yeh”.\n\nThey settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.\n\n“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. “If I was ter, er, speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts”?\n\n“Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.\n\n“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts”? Harry asked.\n\n“Spells, enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. “They say there’s dragons guardin’ the highsecurity vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way, Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat”.\n\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d never had so many questions in his life.\n\n“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid muttered, turning the page.\n\n“There’s a Ministry of Magic”? Harry asked, before he could stop himself.\n\n“’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin’ fer advice”.\n\n“But what does a Ministry of Magic do”?\n\n“Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the country”.\n\n“Why”?\n\n“Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left alone”.\n\nAt this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.\n\nPassersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn’t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh”?\n\n“Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts”?\n\n“Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a dragon”.\n\n“You’d like one”?\n\n“Wanted one ever since I was a kid, here we go”.\n\nThey had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.\n\nPeople stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary yellow circus tent.\n\n“Still got yer letter, Harry”? he asked as he counted stitches. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.\n\n“Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything yeh need”.\n\nHarry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t noticed the night before, and read:\n\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY.\n\nUNIFORM.\n\nFirst year students will require:\n\n1: Three sets of plain work robes (black).\n\n2: One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear.\n\n3: One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar).\n\n4: One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings).\n\nPlease note that all pupils’ clothes should carry name tags.\nCOURSE BOOKS.\n\nAll students should have a copy of each of the following:\n\nThe Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk.\n\nA History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot.\n\nMagical Theory by Adalbert Waffling.\n\nA Beginners’ Guide to Transfiguration by Emetic Switch.\n\nOne Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore.\n\nMagical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger.\n\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander.\n\nThe Dark Forces: A Guide to Self Protection by Quentin Trimble.\n\nOTHER EQUIPMENT: \n\n1 wand.\n\n1 cauldron (pewter, standard size 2) set\n\n1 set of glass or crystal phials\n\n1 telescope set\n\n1 brass scales.\n\nStudents may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad.\n\nPARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE NOT ALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS.\n\n“Can we buy all this in London”? Harry wondered aloud.\n\n“If yeh know where to go,” said Hagrid.\n\nHarry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.\n\n“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said as they climbed a broken down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.\n\nHagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting him.\n\n“This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky Cauldron. It’s a famous place”.\n\nIt was a tiny, grubby looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t pointed it out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn’t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.\n\nFor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, Hagrid”?\n\n“Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees buckle.\n\n“Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is this, can this be, ”?\n\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\n\n“Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry Potter ; what an honor”.\n\nHe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.\n\n“Welcome back, Mr Potter, welcome back”.\n\nHarry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.\n\nThen there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.\n\n“Doris Crockford, Mr Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last”.\n\n“So proud, Mr Potter, I’m just so proud”.\n\n“Always wanted to shake your hand, I’m all of a flutter”.\n\n“Delighted, Mr Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus Diggle”.\n\n“I’ve seen you before”! said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in his excitement. “You bowed to me once in a shop”.\n\n“He remembers”! cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. “Did you hear that? He remembers me”! Harry shook hands again and again, Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.\n\nA pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching.\n\n“Professor Quirrell”! said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts”.\n\n“P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you”.\n\n“What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell”?\n\n“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think about it. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter”? He laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself”. He looked terrified at the very thought.\n\nBut the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.\n\n“Must get on, lots ter buy. Come on, Harry”.\n\nDoris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.\n\nHagrid grinned at Harry.\n\n“Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh, mind you, he’s usually tremblin’”.\n\n“Is he always that nervous”?\n\n“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin’ outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience; . They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag, never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject, now, where’s me umbrella”?\n\nVampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\n\n“Three up ; two across,” he muttered. “Right, stand back, Harry”.\n\nHe tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.\n\nThe brick he had touched quivered, it wriggled, in the middle, a small hole appeared, it grew wider and wider, a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.\n\n“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley”.\n\nHe grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.\n\nThe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons, All Sizes, Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver, Self Stirring, Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.\n\n“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money first”.\n\nHarry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, “Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad; ”.\n\nA low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium, Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. “Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand, fastest ever, ” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon; .\n\n“Gringotts,” said Hagrid.\n\nThey had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was, \n\n“Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:\n\nEnter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn. \nSo if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there.\n“Like I said, Yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said Hagrid.\n\nA pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.\n\n“Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come ter take some money outta Mr Harry Potter’s safe”.\n\n“You have his key, sir”?\n\n“Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin’s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.\n\n“Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.\n\nThe goblin looked at it closely.\n\n“That seems to be in order”.\n\n“An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen”.\n\nThe goblin read the letter carefully.\n\n“Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook”!\n\nGriphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.\n\n“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen”? Harry asked.\n\n“Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore’s trusted me. More ’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that”.\n\nGriphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in, Hagrid with some difficulty, and were off.\n\nAt first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn’t steering.\n\nHarry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late, they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.\n\n“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, “what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite”?\n\n“Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ ask me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick”.\n\nHe did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.\n\nGriphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.\n\n“All yours,” smiled Hagrid.\n\nAll Harry’s, it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t have known about this or they’d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\n\nHagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\n\n“The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. “Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh”. He turned to Griphook. “Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly”?\n\n“One speed only,” said Griphook.\n\nThey were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.\n\nVault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\n\n“Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.\n\n“If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,” said Griphook.\n\n“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside”? Harry asked.\n\n“About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.\n\nSomething really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least, but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.\n\n“Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to me on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid.\n\nOne wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he’d had in his whole life, more money than even Dudley had ever had.\n\n“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. “Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick me up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts”. He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous.\n\nMadam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.\n\n“Hogwarts, dear”? she said, when Harry started to speak. “Got the lot here, another young man being fitted up just now, in fact”.\n\nIn the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.\n\n“Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too”?\n\n“Yes,” said Harry.\n\n“My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s up the street looking at wands,” said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow”.\n\nHarry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\n\n“Have you got your own broom”? the boy went on.\n\n“No,” said Harry.\n\n“Play Quidditch at all”?\n\n“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.\n\n“I do, Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you’ll be in yet”?\n\n“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\n\n“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been, imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you”?\n\n“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.\n\n“I say, look at that man”! said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.\n\n“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t. “He works at Hogwarts”.\n\n“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he”?\n\n“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.\n\n“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage, lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed”.\n\n“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.\n\n“Do you”? said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where are your parents”?\n\n“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the matter with this boy.\n\n“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were our kind, weren’t they”?\n\n“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean”.\n\n“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway”?\n\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.\n\n“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.\n\nHarry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\n\n“What’s up”? said Hagrid.\n\n“Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s Quidditch”?\n\n“Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know, not knowin’ about Quidditch”!\n\n“Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate boy in Madam Malkin’s.\n\n“, and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t even be allowed in”.\n\n“Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh were, he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his parents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ’em in a long line o’ Muggles, look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister”!\n\n“So what is Quidditch”?\n\n“It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like, like soccer in the Muggle world, everyone follows Quidditch, played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four balls, sorta hard ter explain the rules”.\n\n“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff”?\n\n“School houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’ duffers, but, ”\n\n“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.\n\n“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one”.\n\n“Vol, sorry, You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts”?\n\n“Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid.\n\nThey bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.\n\n“I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley”.\n\n“I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,” said Hagrid. “An’ anyway, yeh couldn’ work any of the curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level”.\n\nHagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).\n\nOutside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list again.\n\n“Just yer wand left, A yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birthday present”.\n\nHarry felt himself go red.\n\n“You don’t have to, ”\n\n“I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at, an’ I don’ like cats, they make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’ everythin’”.\n\nTwenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn’t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.\n\n“Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect you’ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivander’s left now, only place fer wands, Ollivander’s, and yeh gotta have the best wand”.\n\nA magic wand ; this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.\n\nThe last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.\n\nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.\n\n“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.\n\nAn old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.\n\n“Hello,” said Harry awkwardly.\n\n“Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter”. It wasn’t a question. “You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work”.\n\nMr Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.\n\n“Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it, it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course”.\n\nMr Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.\n\n“And that’s where . . ”.\n\nMr Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long, white finger.\n\n“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly. “Thirteen and a half inches. Yew Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands ; well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to do; ”.\n\nHe shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.\n\n“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again; . Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it”?\n\n“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid.\n\n“Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled”? said Mr Ollivander, suddenly stern.\n\n“Er, yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. “I’ve still got the pieces, though,” he added brightly.\n\n“But you don’t use them”? said Mr Ollivander sharply.\n\n“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.\n\n“Hmmm,” said Mr Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. “Well, now, Mr. Potter. Let me see”. He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. “Which is your wand arm”?\n\n“Er, well, I’m right handed,” said Harry.\n\n“Hold out your arm. That’s it”. He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand”.\n\nHarry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.\n\n“That will do,” he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. “Right then, Mr Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it and give it a wave”.\n\nHarry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.\n\n“Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try, ”\n\nHarry tried, but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr Ollivander.\n\n“No, no here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out”.\n\nHarry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.\n\n“Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we’ll find the perfect match here somewhere, I wonder, now, yes, why not, unusual combination, holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple”.\n\nHarry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr Ollivander cried, “Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well ; how curious ; how very curious . . ”.\n\nHe put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, “Curious ; curious . . ”.\n\n“Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious”?\n\nMr Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.\n\n“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather, just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when it’s brother, why, it’s brother gave you that scar”.\n\nHarry swallowed.\n\n“Yes, thirteen and a half inches. Yew Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember; . I think we must expect great things from you, Mr Potter; . After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things, terrible, yes, but great”.\n\nHarry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr Ollivander bowed them from his shop.\n\nThe late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn’t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry’s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.\n\n“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he said.\n\nHe bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.\n\n“You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid.\n\nHarry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the best birthday of his life, and yet, he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.\n\n“Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr Ollivander ; but I don’t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m famous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol, sorry, I mean, the night my parents died”.\n\nHagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.\n\n“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll have a great time at Hogwarts, I did, still do, ’smatter of fact”.\n\nHagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.\n\n“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,” he said. “First o’ September, King’s Cross, it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll know where to find me; . See yeh soon, Harry”.\n\nThe train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.\n\nHarry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him, in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.\n\nHarry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.\n\nOn the last day of August he thought he’d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King’s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.\n\n“Er, Uncle Vernon”?\n\nUncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.\n\n“Er, I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to, to go to Hogwarts”.\n\nUncle Vernon grunted again.\n\n“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift”?\n\nGrunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.\n\n“Thank you”.\n\nHe was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.\n\n“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they”?\n\nHarry didn’t say anything.\n\n“Where is this school, anyway”?\n\n“I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.\n\n“I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o’clock,” he read.\n\nHis aunt and uncle stared.\n\n“Platform what”?\n\n“Nine and three-quarters”.\n\n“Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon. “There is no platform nine and three-quarters”.\n\n“It’s on my ticket”.\n\n“Barking,” said Uncle Vernon, “howling mad, the lot of them. You’ll see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take you to King’s Cross. We’re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother”.\n\n“Why are you going to London”? Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.\n\n“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle Vernon. “Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings”.\n\nHarry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn’t want to walk into the station in his wizard’s robes, he’d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.\n\nThey reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.\n\n“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine, platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do they”?\n\nHe was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.\n\n“Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He’d have to ask someone.\n\nHe stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said there wasn’t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.\n\nHagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s stand between platforms nine and ten.\n\nAt that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.\n\n“, packed with Muggles, of course, ”\n\nHarry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry’s in front of him, and they had an owl.\n\nHeart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.\n\n“Now, what’s the platform number”? said the boys’ mother.\n\n“Nine and three-quarters”! piped a small girl, also red headed, who was holding her hand, “Mom, can’t I go . . ”.\n\n“You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first”.\n\nWhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it, but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.\n\n“Fred, you next,” the plump woman said.\n\n“I’m not Fred, I’m George,” said the boy. “Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can’t you tell I’m George”?\n\n“Sorry, George, dear”.\n\n“Only joking, I am Fred,” said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone, but how had he done it?\n\nNow the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there, and then, quite suddenly, he wasn’t anywhere.\n\nThere was nothing else for it.\n\n“Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman.\n\n“Hello, dear,” she said. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s new, too”.\n\nShe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\n\n“Yes,” said Harry. “The thing is, the thing is, I don’t know how to, ”\n\n“How to get onto the platform”? she said kindly, and Harry nodded.\n\n“Not to worry,” she said. “All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into it, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you’re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron”\n\n“Er, okay,” said Harry.\n\nHe pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid.\n\nHe started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he’d be in trouble, leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run, the barrier was coming nearer and nearer, he wouldn’t be able to stop, the cart was out of control, he was a foot away, he closed his eyes ready for the crash, \n\nIt didn’t come ; he kept on running ; he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-quarters on it. He had done it.\n\nSmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.\n\nThe first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again”.\n\n“Oh, Neville,” he heard the old woman sigh.\n\nA boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.\n\n“Give us a look, Lee, go on”.\n\nThe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.\n\nHarry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.\n\n“Want a hand”? It was one of the red haired twins he’d followed through the barrier.\n\n“Yes, please,” Harry panted.\n\n“Oy, Fred! C’mere and help”!\n\nWith the twins’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment.\n\n“Thanks,” said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.\n\n“What’s that”? said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry’s lightning scar.\n\n“Blimey,” said the other twin. “Are you, ”\n\n“He is,” said the first twin. “Aren’t you”? he added to Harry.\n\n“What”? said Harry.\n\n“Harry Potter,” chorused the twins.\n\n“Oh, him,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am”.\n\nThe two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train’s open door.\n\n“Fred? George? Are you there”?\n\n“Coming, Mom”\n\nWith a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.\n\nHarry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.\n\n“Ron, you’ve got something on your nose”.\n\nThe youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.\n\n“Mom, geroff, ” He wriggled free.\n\n“Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie”? said one of the twins.\n\n“Shut up,” said Ron\n\n“Where’s Percy”? said their mother.\n\n“He’s coming now”.\n\nThe oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it.\n\n“Can’t stay long, Mother,” he said. “I’m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves, ”\n\n“Oh, are you a prefect, Percy”? said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. “You should have said something, we had no idea”.\n\n“Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,” said the other twin. “Once, ”\n\n“Or twice, ”\n\n“A minute, ”\n\n“All summer, ”\n\n“Oh, shut up,” said Percy the Prefect.\n\n“How come Percy gets new robes, anyway”? said one of the twins.\n\n“Because he’s a prefect,” said their mother fondly. “All right, dear, well, have a good term, send me an owl when you get there”.\n\nShe kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.\n\n“Now, you two, this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you’ve, you’ve blown up a toilet or, ”\n\n“Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet”.\n\n“Great idea though, thanks, Mom”\n\n“It’s not funny. And look after Ron”\n\n“Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us”.\n\n“Shut up,” said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.\n\n“Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train”?\n\nHarry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him looking.\n\n“You know that black haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is”?\n\n“Who”?\n\n“Harry Potter”!\n\nHarry heard the little girl’s voice.\n\n“Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please; ”.\n\n“You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn’t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know”?\n\n“Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there, like lightning”.\n\n“Poor dear, no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform”.\n\n“Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like”?\n\nTheir mother suddenly became very stern.\n\n“I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school”.\n\n“All right, keep your hair on”.\n\nA whistle sounded.\n\n“Hurry up”! their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good bye, and their younger sister began to cry.\n\n“Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls”.\n\n“We’ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat”.\n\n“George”!\n\n“Only joking, Mom”\n\nThe train began to move. Harry saw the boys’ mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.\n\nHarry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn’t know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.\n\nThe door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.\n\n“Anyone sitting there”? he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. “Everywhere else is full”.\n\nHarry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn’t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.\n\n“Hey, Ron”.\n\nThe twins were back.\n\n“Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train, Lee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there”.\n\n“Right,” mumbled Ron\n\n“Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then”.\n\n“Bye,” said Harry and Ron The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them.\n\n“Are you really Harry Potter”? Ron blurted out.\n\nHarry nodded.\n\n“Oh well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George’s jokes,” said Ron “And have you really got, you know . . ”.\n\nHe pointed at Harry’s forehead.\n\nHarry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.\n\n“So that’s where You-Know-Who, ”?\n\n“Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it”.\n\n“Nothing”? said Ron eagerly.\n\n“Well, I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else”.\n\n“Wow,” said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.\n\n“Are all your family wizards”? asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.\n\n“Er, Yes, I think so,” said Ron “I think Mom’s got a second cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him”.\n\n“So you must know loads of magic already”.\n\nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.\n\n“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron “What are they like”?\n\n“Horrible, well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I’d had three wizard brothers”.\n\n“Five,” said Ron For some reason, he was looking gloomy. “I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left, Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy’s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it’s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand, and Percy’s old rat”.\n\nRon reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.\n\n“His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff, I mean, I got Scabbers instead”.\n\nRon’s ears went pink. He seemed to think he’d said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.\n\nHarry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he’d never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.\n\n“; and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort, ”\n\nRon gasped.\n\n“What”? said Harry.\n\n“You said You-Know-Who’s name”! said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. “I’d have thought you, of all people, ”\n\n“I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,” said Harry, “I just never knew you shouldn’t. See what I mean? I’ve got loads to learn; . I bet,” he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, “I bet I’m the worst in the class”.\n\n“You won’t be. There’s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough”.\n\nWhile they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.\n\nAround half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, “Anything off the cart, dears”?\n\nHarry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron’s ears went pink again and he muttered that he’d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor.\n\nHe had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry, but the woman didn’t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.\n\nRon stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.\n\n“Hungry, are you”?\n\n“Starving,” said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.\n\nRon had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, “She always forgets I don’t like corned beef”.\n\n“Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a pasty. “Go on, ”\n\n“You don’t want this, it’s all dry,” said Ron “She hasn’t got much time,” he added quickly, “you know, with five of us”.\n\n“Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry’s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).\n\n“What are these”? Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. “They’re not really frogs, are they”? He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him.\n\n“No,” said Ron “But see what the card is. I’m missing Agrippa”.\n\n“What”?\n\n“Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know, Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect, famous witches and wizards. I’ve got about five hundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy”.\n\nHarry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man’s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.\n\n“So this is Dumbledore”! said Harry.\n\n“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore”! said Ron “Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa, thanks, ”\n\nHarry turned over his card and read:\n\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE \n\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS.\n\nConsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.\n\nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore’s face had disappeared.\n\n“He’s gone”!\n\n“Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” said Ron “He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again and I’ve got about six of her ; do you want it? You can start collecting”.\n\nRon’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.\n\n“Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos”.\n\n“Do they? What, they don’t move at all”? Ron sounded amazed. “Weird”!\n\nHarry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans.\n\n“You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned Harry. “When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor, you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once”.\n\nRon picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.\n\n“Bleaaargh, see? Sprouts”.\n\nThey had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper.\n\nThe countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.\n\nThere was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked tearful.\n\n“Sorry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all”?\n\nWhen they shook their heads, he wailed, “I’ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me”!\n\n“He’ll turn up,” said Harry.\n\n“Yes,” said the boy miserably. “Well, if you see him . . ”.\n\nHe left.\n\n“Don’t know why he’s so bothered,” said Ron “If I’d brought a toad I’d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can’t talk”.\n\nThe rat was still snoozing on Ron’s lap.\n\n“He might have died and you wouldn’t know the difference,” said Ron in disgust. “I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn’t work. I’ll show you, look . . ”.\n\nHe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.\n\n“Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out. Anyway, ”\n\nHe had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.\n\n“Has anyone seen a toad? Neville’s lost one,” she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.\n\n“We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” said Ron, but the girl wasn’t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.\n\n“Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then”.\n\nShe sat down. Ron looked taken aback.\n\n“Er, all right”.\n\nHe cleared his throat.\n\n“Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow”.\nHe waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep.\n\n“Are you sure that’s a real spell”? said the girl. “Well, it’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it’s all worked for me. Nobody in my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I’ve heard, I’ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough, I’m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you”?\n\nShe said all this very fast.\n\nHarry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either.\n\n“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered.\n\n“Harry Potter,” said Harry.\n\n“Are you really”? said Hermione. “I know all about you, of course, I got a few extra books for background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century”.\n\n“Am I”? said Harry, feeling dazed.\n\n“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I could if it was me,” said Hermione. “Do either of you know what house you’ll be in? I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad; . Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon”.\n\nAnd she left, taking the toadless boy with her.\n\n“Whatever house I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron He threw his wand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell, George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud”.\n\n“What house are your brothers in”? asked Harry.\n\n“Gryffindor,” said Ron Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. “Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin”.\n\n“That’s the house Vol, , I mean, You-Know-Who was in”?\n\n“Yeah,” said Ron He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.\n\n“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind off houses. “So what do your oldest brothers do now that they’ve left, anyway”?\n\nHarry was wondering what a wizard did once he’d finished school.\n\n“Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,” said Ron “Did you hear about Gringotts? It’s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the Muggles, someone tried to rob a high security vault”.\n\nHarry stared.\n\n“Really? What happened to them”?\n\n“Nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t been caught. My dad says it must’ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don’t think they took anything, that’s what’s odd. ’Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it”.\n\nHarry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying “Voldemort” without worrying.\n\n“What’s your favorite Quidditch team”? Ron asked.\n\n“Er, I don’t know any,” Harry confessed.\n\n“What”! Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s the best game in the world, ” And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he’d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he’d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.\n\nThree boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.\n\n“Is it true”? he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is it”?\n\n“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.\n\n“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. “And my name’s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy”.\n\nRon gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget. Draco Malfoy looked at him.\n\n“Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford”.\n\nHe turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there”.\n\nHe held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry didn’t take it.\n\n“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” he said coolly.\n\nDraco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.\n\n“I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” he said slowly. “Unless you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as your parents. They didn’t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you”.\n\nBoth Harry and Ron stood up.\n\n“Say that again,” Ron said, his face as red as his hair.\n\n“Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you”? Malfoy sneered.\n\n“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.\n\n“But we don’t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We’ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some”.\n\nGoyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron, Ron leapt forward, but before he’d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.\n\nScabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle’s knuckle, Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they’d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.\n\n“What has been going on”? she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.\n\n“I think he’s been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. “No, I don’t believe it, he’s gone back to sleep, ”\n\nAnd so he had.\n\n“You’ve met Malfoy before”?\n\nHarry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.\n\n“I’ve heard of his family,” said Ron darkly. “They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they’d been bewitched. My dad doesn’t believe it. He says Malfoy’s father didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side”. He turned to Hermione. “Can we help you with something”?\n\n“You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we’re nearly there. You haven’t been fighting, have you? You’ll be in trouble before we even get there”!\n\n“Scabbers has been fighting, not us,” said Ron, scowling at her. “Would you mind leaving while we change”?\n\n“All right, I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniffy voice. “And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know”?\n\nRon glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.\n\nHe and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron’s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.\n\nA voice echoed through the train: “We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes’ time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately”.\n\nHarry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.\n\nThe train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: “Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here! All right there, Harry”?\n\nHagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.\n\n“C’mon, follow me, any more firs’ years? Mind yer step, now! Firs’ years follow me”!\n\nSlipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.\n\n“Ye’ all get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid called over his shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here”.\n\nThere was a loud “Oooooh”!\n\nThe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.\n\n“No more’n four to a boat”! Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.\n\n“Everyone in”? shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. “Right then, FORWARD”!\n\nAnd the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.\n\n“Heads down”! yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.\n\n“Oy, you there! Is this your toad”? said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.\n\n“Trevor”! cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.\n\nThey walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door.\n\n“Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad”?\n\nHagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.",
        "ru": "Мистер и миссис Дурсль из дома номер четыре на Тисовой улице с гордостью сказали, что они совершенно нормальные, большое вам спасибо. Они были последними людьми, которых можно было ожидать от чего-то странного или загадочного, потому что они просто не выдерживали такой ерунды.\n\nМистер Дурслей был директором фирмы Grunnings, которая производила сверла. Это был крупный, мускулистый мужчина без шеи, хотя у него были очень большие усы. Миссис Дурслей была худой и светловолосой, у нее было почти вдвое больше обычного размера шеи, что было очень кстати, поскольку она проводила так много времени, перелезая через садовые заборы, подглядывая за соседями. У Дурслей был маленький сын по имени Дадли, и, по их мнению, лучшего мальчика не было нигде.\n\nУ Дурсли было все, что они хотели, но у них также был секрет, и их самым большим страхом было то, что кто-нибудь его откроет. Они не думали, что выдержат это, если кто-нибудь узнает о Поттерах. Миссис Поттер приходилась сестрой миссис Дурслей, но они не встречались несколько лет; на самом деле миссис Дурслей притворилась, что у нее нет сестры, потому что ее сестра и ее ни на что не годный муж были настолько дурслистскими, насколько это вообще возможно. Дурсли содрогнулись при мысли, что бы сказали соседи, если бы Поттеры вышли на улицу. Дурсли знали, что у Поттеров тоже есть маленький сын, но они даже не видели его. Этот мальчик был еще одной веской причиной держать Поттеров подальше; они не хотели, чтобы Дадли общался с таким ребенком.\n\nКогда мистер и миссис Дурсль проснулись в унылый серый вторник, наша история началась, в облачном небе за окном не было ничего, что указывало бы на то, что странные и загадочные вещи скоро будут происходить по всей стране. Мистер Дурслей хмыкнул, выбирая свой самый скучный галстук для работы, а миссис Дурслей весело сплетничала, усаживая кричащего Дадли на его высокий стул.\n\nНикто из них не заметил, как мимо окна пролетела большая смуглая сова.\n\nВ половине девятого мистер Дурслей взял свой портфель, клюнул миссис Дурслей в щеку и попытался поцеловать Дадли на прощание, но промахнулся, потому что Дадли сейчас в истерике и кидал хлопья по стенам.\n\n- Малыш, - фыркнул мистер Дурслей, выходя из дома. Он сел в свою машину и выехал с четвертой дороги.\n\nНа углу улицы он заметил первый признак чего-то необычного - кота, читающего карту. На секунду мистер Дурслей не осознавал, что он видел, - затем он резко повернул голову, чтобы посмотреть еще раз. На углу Тисовой дороги стоял полосатый кот, но карты не было видно. О чем он мог думать? Должно быть, это игра света. Мистер Дурслей моргнул и уставился на кота. Он смотрел в ответ. Заворачивая за угол и поднимаясь по дороге, мистер Дурслей смотрел на кошку в зеркало. Теперь он читал вывеску с надписью «Тисовая улица» - нет, глядя на вывеску; кошки не могли читать карты или знаки. Мистер Дурслей слегка встряхнул и выбросил кота из головы. По дороге в город он ни о чем не думал, кроме большого заказа тренировок, который он надеялся получить в тот день.\n\nНо на окраине города учения были вытеснены им из-за чего-то другого. Сидя в обычной утренней пробке, он не мог не заметить, что вокруг было много странно одетых людей. Люди в плащах. Мистер Дурслей терпеть не мог людей в забавной одежде - таких нарядов, которые вы видели у молодых людей! Он предположил, что это какая-то дурацкая новая мода. Он постучал пальцами по рулю, и его взгляд упал на кучку этих чудаков, стоявших совсем рядом. Они взволнованно перешептывались. Мистер Дурслей пришел в ярость, увидев, что двое из них совсем не молоды; почему, этот человек должен был быть старше его и носить изумрудно-зеленый плащ! Его нерв! Но затем мистера Дурсля осенило, что это, вероятно, какой-то глупый трюк - эти люди явно собирали деньги для чего-то… да, вот и все. Движение продолжилось, и через несколько минут мистер Дурслей прибыл на стоянку Граннингса, его мысли вернулись к тренировкам.\n\nМистер Дурслей всегда сидел спиной к окну в своем офисе на девятом этаже. Если бы он этого не сделал, ему было бы труднее сосредоточиться на упражнениях этим утром. Он не видел проносившихся мимо сов среди бела дня, хотя люди с улицы видели; они указывали и смотрели с открытыми ртами, когда сова за совой мчалась над их головами. Большинство из них никогда не видели сову даже ночью. У мистера Дурсля, однако, было совершенно нормальное утро, свободное от сов. Он кричал на пять разных людей. Он сделал несколько важных телефонных звонков и крикнул еще немного. Он был в очень хорошем настроении до обеда, когда подумал, что размять ноги и перейдет дорогу, чтобы купить себе булочку в пекарне.\n\nОн совсем забыл о людях в плащах, пока не прошел мимо группы пекарей. Проходя мимо, он сердито смотрел на них. Он не знал почему, но они беспокоили его. Эта группа тоже возбужденно перешептывалась, и он не увидел ни единой банки для сбора. На обратном пути мимо них, сжимая в сумке большой пончик, он уловил несколько слов из того, что они говорили.\n\n«Поттеры, верно, это то, что я слышал»\n\n«да, их сын Гарри»\n\nМистер Дурсль замер. Его охватил страх. Он оглянулся на шептунов, как будто хотел им что-то сказать, но передумал.\n\nОн бросился обратно через дорогу, поспешил в свой офис, крикнул секретарше, чтобы она не беспокоила его, схватил телефон и почти закончил набирать домашний номер, когда передумал. Он положил трубку и задумчиво погладил усы… нет, он был глуп. Поттер не был таким уж необычным именем. Он был уверен, что есть много людей по имени Поттер, у которых есть сын по имени Гарри. Если подумать, он даже не был уверен, что его племянника звали Гарри. Он даже не видел мальчика. Возможно, это был Харви. Или Гарольд. Не было смысла беспокоить миссис Дурсль; она всегда так расстраивалась при любом упоминании о сестре. Он не винил ее - если бы у него была такая сестра… но все равно те люди в плащах…\n\nВ тот день ему было намного труднее сосредоточиться на упражнениях, и когда он вышел из здания в пять часов, он все еще так волновался, что наткнулся на кого-то прямо за дверью.\n\n«Извини», - проворчал он, когда крохотный старичок споткнулся и чуть не упал. Прошло несколько секунд, прежде чем мистер Дурсль понял, что на мужчине был фиолетовый плащ. Он совсем не выглядел расстроенным из-за того, что его чуть не повалили на землю. Напротив, его лицо расплылось в широкой улыбке, и он сказал скрипучим голосом, от которого прохожие уставились: «Не извиняйтесь, мой дорогой сэр, потому что ничто не могло меня сегодня расстроить! Радуйся, Сами-Знаете-Кто ушел наконец! Даже такие маглы, как вы, должны праздновать этот счастливый, счастливый день! »\n\nИ старик обнял мистера Дурсля посередине и пошел прочь.\n\nМистер Дурсль застыл как вкопанный. Его обнял совершенно незнакомый человек. Еще он думал, что его называли маглом, как бы там ни было. Он был потрясен. Он поспешил к своей машине и отправился домой, надеясь, что он воображает вещи, на которые он никогда не надеялся раньше, потому что он не одобрял воображение.\n\nКогда он подъехал к подъездной дорожке дома номер четыре, первое, что он увидел - и это не улучшило его настроения - была полосатая кошка, которую он заметил этим утром. Теперь он сидел на стене его сада. Он был уверен, что это было то же самое; у него были такие же отметины вокруг глаз.\n\n«Шу»! - громко сказал мистер Дурслей.\n\nКот не двинулся с места. Он просто посмотрел на него строго. Было ли это нормальным кошачьим поведением? - подумал мистер Дурсль. Пытаясь взять себя в руки, он вошел в дом. Он по-прежнему был полон решимости ничего не говорить жене.\n\nМиссис Дурслей хорошо провела нормальный день. За ужином она рассказала ему все о проблемах миссис Соседство с дочерью и о том, как Дадли выучил новое слово («Не буду»!). Мистер Дурслей старался вести себя нормально. Уложив Дадли спать, он вошел в гостиную как раз вовремя, чтобы успеть успеть на последний репортаж вечерних новостей:\n\n«И наконец, орнитологи во всем мире сообщают, что совы в стране сегодня ведут себя очень необычно. Хотя совы обычно охотятся ночью и почти никогда не видны при дневном свете, с восхода солнца были зафиксированы сотни случаев, когда эти птицы летали во всех направлениях. Эксперты не могут объяснить, почему совы внезапно изменили режим сна ». Диктор позволил себе усмехнуться. «Самое загадочное. А теперь перейдем к Джиму Макгаффину с погодой. Джим, не собираешься ли сегодня дождаться совиных дождей?\n\n«Что ж, Тед, - сказал синоптик, - я не знаю об этом, но не только совы сегодня ведут себя странно. Зрители из Кента, Йоркшира и Данди звонили мне и рассказывали, что вместо дождя, который я обещал вчера, на них пошел дождь из падающих звезд! Возможно, люди празднуют Ночь костра рано - не раньше следующей недели, ребята! Но я могу обещать сегодня дождливую ночь.\nМистер Дурслей замер в кресле. Падающие звезды по всей Британии? Совы летают при дневном свете? Повсюду загадочные люди в плащах? И шепот, шепот о Поттерах.\n\nМиссис Дурслей вошла в гостиную с двумя чашками чая. Это было бесполезно. Он должен ей что-то сказать. Он нервно прочистил горло. - Э Петуния, дорогая, в последнее время ты ничего не слышала от сестры, не так ли?\n\nКак он и ожидал, миссис Дурслей выглядела шокированной и рассерженной. В конце концов, они обычно делали вид, что у нее нет сестры.\n\n«Нет», - резко ответила она. \"Зачем\"?\n\n«Смешные вещи в новостях», - пробормотал мистер Дурсль. «Совы, падающие звезды, и сегодня в городе было много забавных людей».\n\n\"Так \"? - оборвала миссис Дурсль.\n\n«Ну, я просто подумал, может, это как-то связано с ее толпой».\n\nМиссис Дурслей пригубила чай сквозь поджатые губы. Мистер Дурслей задался вопросом, осмелился ли он сказать ей, что слышал имя «Поттер». Он решил, что не посмеет. Вместо этого он сказал как можно небрежнее: «Их сын, он будет примерно того же возраста, что и Дадли, не так ли»?\n\n- Полагаю, - сухо ответила миссис Дурслей.\n\n«Как его снова зовут? Говард, не так ли?\n\n\"Гарри. Гадкое, общее имя, если вы спросите меня.\n\n«О да, - сказал мистер Дурслей, его сердце ужасно упало. «Да, я полностью согласен».\n\nОн не сказал ни слова на эту тему, пока они поднимались наверх спать. Пока миссис Дурслей была в ванной, мистер Дурслей подкрался к окну спальни и заглянул в палисадник. Кот все еще был там. Он смотрел на Тисовую улицу, как будто чего-то ждал.\n\nОн что-то воображал? Может ли все это иметь какое-то отношение к Поттерам? Если это так, если выяснится, что они были родственниками пары, ну, он не думал, что выдержит это.\n\nДурсли легли в постель. Миссис Дурслей быстро заснула, но мистер Дурслей лежал без сна, обдумывая все это. Его последней утешительной мыслью перед сном было то, что даже если Поттеры замешаны, у них нет причин приближаться к нему и миссис Дурслей. Поттеры очень хорошо знали, что он и Петуния думали о них и им подобных. Он не мог понять, как он и Петуния могли замешаться во всем, что могло происходить, он зевнул и перевернулся, это не могло повлиять на них.\n\nКак сильно он ошибался.\n\nМистер Дурсль мог засыпать беспокойным сном, но кот на стене снаружи не выказывал признаков сонливости. Он сидел неподвижно, как статуя, не мигая, устремив глаза на дальний угол Тисовой улицы. Он не так сильно дрожал, когда хлопнула дверца машины на следующей улице или когда две совы пролетели над головой. Фактически, была почти полночь, когда кошка вообще двинулась.\n\nВ углу, за которым наблюдал кот, появился человек, он появился так внезапно и тихо, что можно было подумать, что он только что выскочил из земли. Хвост кота дернулся, а глаза сузились.\n\nНичего подобного этому человеку никогда не видели на Тисовой улице. Он был высоким, худым и очень старым, судя по серебристым его волосам и бороде, которые были достаточно длинными, чтобы их можно было заправить за пояс. На нем была длинная мантия, пурпурный плащ, спускающийся по земле, и ботинки на высоком каблуке с пряжками. Его голубые глаза были светлыми, яркими и сверкали под очками-полумесяцами, а нос был очень длинным и кривым, как будто его сломали как минимум дважды. Звали этого человека Альбус Дамблдор.\n\nАльбус Дамблдор, похоже, не осознавал, что он только что прибыл на улицу, где все, от его имени до ботинок, было нежелательным. Он копался в своем плаще, что-то искал. Но он, казалось, понимал, что за ним наблюдают, потому что внезапно взглянул на кошку, которая все еще смотрела на него с другого конца улицы. Почему-то вид кота его, казалось, позабавил. Он усмехнулся и пробормотал: «Я должен был знать».\n\nОн нашел то, что искал, во внутреннем кармане. Похоже, это была серебряная зажигалка. Он распахнул ее, поднял в воздух и щелкнул. Ближайший уличный фонарь с тихим хлопком погас. Он щелкнул еще раз, следующая лампа погрузилась в темноту. Двенадцать раз он щелкнул «Put Outer», пока на всей улице не оставались только два крошечных булавочных укола вдалеке, которые были глазами кошки, наблюдающей за ним. Если бы сейчас кто-нибудь выглянул из своего окна, даже если бы миссис Дурслей пристально смотрела в глаза, он бы не увидел ничего, что происходило на тротуаре. Дамблдор сунул «Внешний мир» обратно в свой плащ и направился по улице к дому номер четыре, где сел на стену рядом с котом. Он не смотрел на нее, но через мгновение заговорил с ней.\n\n«Рад видеть вас здесь, профессор МакГонагалл».\n\nОн повернулся, чтобы улыбнуться полосатой кошке, но ее уже не было. Вместо этого он улыбался довольно сурово выглядящей женщине в квадратных очках, точно такой же, как у кошки вокруг глаз. На ней тоже был плащ, изумрудный. Ее черные волосы были собраны в тугой пучок. Она выглядела явно взъерошенной.\n\n«Как вы узнали, что это я»? она спросила.\n\n«Мой дорогой профессор, я никогда не видел кошку сидеть так натянуто».\n\n«Если бы вы весь день сидели на кирпичной стене, вы были бы скованы», - сказала профессор МакГонагалл.\n\n\"Весь день? Когда можно было праздновать? По пути сюда я, должно быть, провел с десяток застолий и вечеринок.\n\nПрофессор МакГонагалл сердито фыркнула.\n\n«О да, все празднуют, хорошо, - нетерпеливо сказала она. «Можно подумать, что они будут немного осторожнее, но нет, даже маглы заметили, что что-то происходит. Это было в их новостях ». Она кивнула на темное окно гостиной Дурслей. «Я слышал это. Стаи сов, падающие звезды. Ну, они не совсем тупые. Они должны были что-то заметить. Падающие звезды в Кенте, держу пари, что это был Дедал Диггл. У него никогда не было особого смысла ».\n\n«Вы не можете их винить», - мягко сказал Дамблдор. «У нас было очень мало поводов для празднования за одиннадцать лет».\n\n«Я знаю это», - раздраженно сказала профессор МакГонагалл. «Но это не повод терять голову. Люди ведут себя совершенно беззаботно, выходят на улицы среди бела дня, даже не одетые в маггловскую одежду, обмениваются слухами ».\n\nОна бросила на Дамблдора резкий искоса взгляд, как будто надеясь, что он собирается ей что-то сказать, но он этого не сделал, поэтому она продолжила. «Было бы хорошо, если бы в тот самый день, когда Сами-Знаете-Кто, кажется, наконец исчез, маглы узнали обо всех нас. Полагаю, он действительно ушел, Дамблдор?\n\n«Конечно, кажется, - сказал Дамблдор. «Нам есть за что быть благодарными. Не хочешь ли лимонную дольку? \"\n\n\"Что \"?\n\n«Лимонная долька. Они что-то вроде сладких маглов, которые мне очень нравятся.\n\n«Нет, спасибо», - холодно ответила профессор МакГонагалл, как будто она не думала, что сейчас самое время для лимонных капель. «Как я уже сказал, даже если Сами-Знаете-Кто ушел»\n\n«Мой дорогой профессор, неужели такой разумный человек, как ты, может называть его по имени? Вся эта чушь про \"Сами-Знаете-Кто\", вот уже одиннадцать лет я пытаюсь убедить людей называть его собственным именем: Волан-де-Морт. Профессор МакГонагалл вздрогнула, но Дамблдор, отклеивавший две лимонные дольки, казалось, не заметил. «Все становится так запутанно, если мы продолжаем говорить« Сами-Знаете-Кто ». Я никогда не видел причин бояться произнесения имени Волан-де-Морта.\n\n«Я знаю, что вы этого не сделали», - сказала профессор МакГонагалл наполовину раздраженно, наполовину восхищенно. «Но ты другой. Все знают, что ты единственный, кого Ты-Знаешь, ну ладно, Волдеморт, боялся.\n\n«Вы мне льстите», - спокойно сказал Дамблдор. «Волдеморт обладал способностями, которых у меня никогда не будет».\n\n«Только потому, что ты слишком, ну, благороден, чтобы их использовать».\n\n«Хорошо, что темно. Я не так сильно покраснел с тех пор, как мадам Помфри сказала мне, что ей нравятся мои новые наушники.\n\nПрофессор МакГонагалл резко взглянула на Дамблдора и сказала: «Совы - ничто по сравнению с распространяющимися слухами. Вы знаете, что все говорят? О том, почему он исчез? О том, что его наконец остановило?\n\nПохоже, профессор МакГонагалл подошла к тому моменту, который она больше всего хотела обсудить, - истинной причине, по которой она весь день ждала на холодной твердой стене, потому что ни кошка, ни женщина не смотрели на Дамблдора таким пронзительным взглядом как она это сделала сейчас. Было очевидно, что что бы ни говорили «все», она не поверила бы этому, пока Дамблдор не сказал ей, что это правда. Однако Дамблдор выбирал еще одну дольку лимона и ничего не ответил.\n\n«Они говорят, - продолжала она, - что прошлой ночью Волдеморт появился в Годриковой лощине. Он пошел искать Поттеров. Ходят слухи, что Лили и Джеймс Поттеры мертвы.\n\nДамблдор склонил голову. Профессор МакГонагалл ахнула.\n\n«Лили и Джеймс, я не могу в это поверить, я не хотел верить, о, Альбус».\n\nДамблдор протянул руку и похлопал ее по плечу. \"Я знаю я знаю\". - тяжело сказал он.\n\nГолос профессора МакГонагалл дрожал, пока она продолжала. \"Это не все. Говорят, он пытался убить сына Поттера, Гарри. Но он не мог. Он не мог убить этого маленького мальчика. Никто не знает, почему и как, но они говорят, что, когда он не смог убить Гарри Поттера, сила Волан-де-Морта каким-то образом сломалась, и поэтому он ушел.\n\nДамблдор мрачно кивнул.\n\n\"Это правда\"? - запнулась профессор МакГонагалл. «После всего, что он сделал, всех людей, которых он убил, он не мог убить маленького мальчика? Это просто поразительно, из всего, что могло его остановить, но, ради всего святого, как Гарри выжил? »\n\n«Мы можем только догадываться», - сказал Дамблдор. «Возможно, мы\n\nникогда не узнаем».\nПрофессор МакГонагалл вынула кружевной платок и промокнула глаза под очками. Дамблдор тяжело вздохнул, вынул из кармана золотые часы и стал их рассматривать. Это были очень странные часы. У него было двенадцать стрелок, но без цифр; вместо этого маленькие планеты двигались по краю. Однако это должно было иметь смысл для Дамблдора, потому что он положил его обратно в карман и сказал: «Хагрид опоздал. Кстати, я полагаю, это он сказал тебе, что я буду здесь?\n\n«Да», - сказала профессор МакГонагалл. «И я не думаю, что ты собираешься сказать мне, зачем ты здесь вообще»?\n\n«Я пришел, чтобы привести Гарри к его тете и дяде. Теперь это единственная семья, которую он оставил ».\n\n«Вы не имеете в виду, вы не имеете в виду людей, которые здесь живут»? - воскликнула профессор МакГонагалл, вскакивая на ноги и указывая на номер четыре. «Дамблдор, ты не можешь. Я смотрел их весь день. Вы не можете найти двух людей, менее похожих на нас. И у них есть сын, я видел, как он всю улицу пинал свою мать, крича о сладостях. Гарри Поттер, приезжай и живи здесь! »\n\n«Это лучшее место для него», - твердо сказал Дамблдор. «Его тетя и дядя смогут ему все объяснить, когда он станет старше. Я написал им письмо ».\n\n\"Письмо\"? - слабо повторила профессор МакГонагалл, снова садясь на стену. «В самом деле, Дамблдор, ты думаешь, что сможешь объяснить все это в письме? Эти люди никогда его не поймут! Он будет знаменитостью, легендой, я не удивлюсь, если сегодня будет известен как день Гарри Поттера в будущем, о Гарри будут написаны книги, каждый ребенок в нашем мире будет знать его имя! »\n\n- Совершенно верно, - сказал Дамблдор, очень серьезно глядя поверх своих очков-полумесяцев. «Этого было бы достаточно, чтобы вскружить голову любому мальчику. Знаменит до того, как сможет ходить и говорить! Известен тем, чего даже не вспомнит! Разве ты не видишь, насколько ему будет лучше, если он вырастет вдали от всего этого, пока не будет готов принять это? »\n\nПрофессор МакГонагалл открыла рот, передумала, сглотнула и сказала: «Да, да, вы, конечно, правы. Но как мальчик сюда попадает, Дамблдор? Она внезапно взглянула на его плащ, как будто подумала, что он, возможно, прячет под ним Гарри.\n\n- Его ведет Хагрид.\n\n- Ты думаешь, мудро доверить Хагриду нечто столь же важное, как это?\n\n«Я бы доверил Хагриду свою жизнь», - сказал Дамблдор.\n\n«Я не говорю, что его сердце находится не в том месте, - неохотно сказала профессор МакГонагалл, - но вы не можете притворяться, что он небрежный. Он действительно склонен, что это было? \"\n\nТишину вокруг нарушил низкий грохочущий звук. Он становился все громче, пока они смотрели вверх и вниз по улице в поисках каких-то признаков фар; он перерос в рев, когда они оба посмотрели на небо, и огромный мотоцикл упал с воздуха и приземлился на дороге перед ними.\n\nЕсли мотоцикл был огромным, то для человека, сидящего на нем, это ничего не значило. Он был почти в два раза выше обычного человека и как минимум в пять раз шире. Он выглядел просто слишком большим, чтобы его допустить, и такие дикие, длинные спутанные густые черные волосы и борода скрывали большую часть его лица, его руки были размером с крышку мусорного бака, а его ноги в кожаных сапогах были похожи на детенышей дельфинов. В своих огромных мускулистых руках он держал пучок одеял.\n\n- Хагрид, - с облегчением сказал Дамблдор. \"В конце концов. А где ты взял этот мотоцикл? »\n\n«Позаимствовал, профессор Дамблдор, сэр», - сказал великан, осторожно слезая с мотоцикла, пока говорил. - Мне его одолжил юный Сириус Блэк. Он у меня, сэр.\n\n«Никаких проблем не было»?\n\n- Нет, сэр, дом был почти разрушен, но я вытащил его, прежде чем маглы начали роиться вокруг. Он заснул, когда мы летели над Бристолем.\n\nДамблдор и профессор МакГонагалл наклонились над пачкой одеял. Внутри был едва виден мальчик, который крепко спал. Под прядью угольно-черных волос у него на лбу они увидели порез странной формы, похожий на разряд молнии.\n\n\"Это где\"? прошептала профессор МакГонагалл.\n\n«Да», - сказал Дамблдор. «У него всегда будет этот шрам».\n\n«Не могли бы вы что-нибудь с этим поделать, Дамблдор»?\n\n«Даже если бы я мог, я бы не стал. Шрамы могут пригодиться. У меня есть один выше левого колена, который является идеальной картой лондонского метро. Что ж, отдай его сюда, Хагрид, нам лучше с этим покончить.\n\nДамблдор взял Гарри на руки и повернулся к дому Дурслей.\n\n«Могу я попрощаться с ним, сэр»? - спросил Хагрид. Он склонил свою огромную лохматую голову над Гарри и поцеловал его, должно быть, очень колючим, узловатым поцелуем. Затем внезапно Хагрид завыл, как раненый пес.\n\n\"Шшш\"! - прошипела профессор МакГонагалл, - вы разбудите маглов!\n\n- П-прости, - всхлипнул Хагрид, вынимая большой пятнистый носовой платок и прячась в нем лицом. «Но я с-не могу этого вынести, Лили и Джеймс мертвы, а бедный маленький Гарри остался жить с магглами»,\n\n«Да, да, это все очень грустно, но возьми себя в руки, Хагрид, или нас найдут», - прошептала профессор МакГонагалл, осторожно похлопав Хагрида по руке, когда Дамблдор перешагнул через низкую ограду сада и пошел вперед дверь. Он осторожно положил Гарри на порог, вынул из-под плаща письмо, сунул его в одеяла Гарри и вернулся к двум другим. Целую минуту все трое стояли и смотрели на маленький сверток; Плечи Хагрида дрожали, профессор МакГонагалл яростно моргнула, и мерцающий свет, который обычно исходил из глаз Дамблдора, казалось, погас.\n\n- Ну, - наконец сказал Дамблдор, - вот и все. Нам нечего здесь оставаться. Мы можем пойти и присоединиться к празднованию ».\n\n- Ага, - сказал Хагрид очень приглушенным голосом, - я заберу его велосипед Сириуса. Доброй ночи, профессор МакГонагалл, профессор Дамблдор, сэр.\n\nВытерев слезящиеся глаза рукавом куртки, Хагрид вскочил на мотоцикл и завел двигатель; с ревом он поднялся в воздух и растворился в ночи.\n\n- Надеюсь, скоро увидимся, профессор МакГонагалл, - сказал Дамблдор, кивая ей. Профессор МакГонагалл высморкалась в ответ.\n\nДамблдор повернулся и пошел обратно по улице. На углу он остановился и достал серебряный Пут-Аутер. Он щелкнул ею один раз, и двенадцать световых шаров устремились обратно к своим уличным фонарям, так что Тисовая улица внезапно засветилась оранжевым светом, и он увидел полосатого кота, крадущегося из-за угла на другом конце улицы. Он просто видел пачку одеял на ступеньке номер четыре.\n\n- Удачи, Гарри, - пробормотал он. Он повернулся на каблуках и, взмахнув плащом, ушел.\n\nВетерок трепал аккуратные живые изгороди Тисовой дороги, которая лежала тихо и аккуратно под чернильным небом - последнее место, где можно было бы ожидать удивительных вещей. Гарри Поттер перевернулся в одеяле, не проснувшись. Одна маленькая рука сомкнулась на письме рядом с ним, и он продолжал спать, не зная, что он особенный, не зная, что он знаменит, не зная, что через несколько часов его разбудит крик миссис Дурслей, когда она открыла входную дверь, чтобы положить из бутылок с молоком, ни то, что он проведет следующие несколько недель, когда его толкает и щиплет его кузен Дадли. Он не мог знать, что в этот самый момент люди, тайно встречающиеся по всей стране, поднимали свои стаканы и говорили в приглушенные голоса: «Гарри Поттеру, мальчику, который выжил»!\n\n2: ГОРЯЩЕЕ СТЕКЛО.\n\nПрошло почти десять лет с тех пор, как Дурсли проснулись и обнаружили на крыльце своего племянника, но Тисовая улица почти не изменилась. Солнце вставало в тех же ухоженных палисадниках и освещало медный номер четыре на входной двери Дурслей; он прокрался в их гостиную, которая была почти такой же, как в ту ночь, когда мистер Дурслей увидел роковую новость о совах. Только фотографии на каминной полке действительно показали, сколько времени прошло. Десять лет назад было много фотографий того, что выглядело как большой розовый пляжный мяч в разноцветных чепчиках, но Дадли Дурслей уже не был младенцем, а теперь на фотографиях был изображен крупный белокурый мальчик, едущий на своем первом велосипеде на карусели. на ярмарке, играя в компьютерную игру со своим отцом, его обнимала и целовала его мать.\n\nИ все же Гарри Поттер все еще был там, спал, но ненадолго. Его тетя Петуния не спала, и именно ее пронзительный голос произвел первый шум за день.\n\n«Вверх! Вставай! Сейчас же\"!\n\nГарри проснулся, вздрогнув. Его тетя снова постучала в дверь.\n\n«Вверх»! - завизжала она. Гарри услышал, как она шла к кухне, а затем услышал, как на плиту ставят сковороду. Он перекатился на спину и попытался вспомнить приснившийся ему сон. Это было хорошо. В нем был летающий мотоцикл. У него было странное ощущение, что ему уже снился такой же сон.\n\nЕго тетя вернулась за дверь.\n\n\"Ты еще не встал\"? она потребовала.\n\n«Почти», - сказал Гарри.\n\n«Ну, давай, я хочу, чтобы ты присмотрел за беконом. И не смей позволять этому гореть, я хочу, чтобы в день рождения Дадди все было идеально ».\n\nГарри застонал.\n\n\"Что вы сказали\"? его тетя рванулась в дверь.\n\n\"Ничего ничего\".\n\nДень рождения Дадли, как он мог забыть? Гарри медленно встал с постели и начал искать носки. Он нашел пару под своей кроватью и, стащив с одной из них паука, надел их. Гарри привык к паукам, потому что шкаф под лестницей был полон ими, и именно там он спал.\n\nWh\n\nКогда он был одет, он пошел по коридору на кухню. Стол был почти спрятан под всеми подарками Дадли на день рождения. Похоже, Дадли получил новый компьютер, который хотел, не говоря уже о втором телевизоре и гоночном велосипеде. Для Гарри было загадкой, почему Дадли хотел гоночный байк, поскольку Дадли был очень толстым и ненавидел упражнения, если, конечно, они не касались ударов кулаком. Любимой боксерской грушей Дадли был Гарри, но он не часто его ловил. Гарри не смотрел на это, но был очень быстр.\nВозможно, это имело какое-то отношение к жизни в темном шкафу, но Гарри всегда был маленьким и худым для своего возраста. Он выглядел еще меньше и худее, чем был на самом деле, потому что все, что ему нужно было носить, было старой одеждой Дадли, а Дадли был примерно в четыре раза больше, чем он был. У Гарри было худое лицо, узловатые колени, черные волосы и ярко-зеленые глаза. На нем были круглые очки, скрепленные большим количеством скотча, потому что Дадли постоянно бил его по носу. Единственное, что нравилось Гарри в его собственной внешности, - это очень тонкий шрам на лбу, имевший форму молнии. Он был у него столько, сколько он себя помнил, и первый вопрос, который он мог вспомнить, задавая своей тете Петунии, был как он это получил.\n\n«В автокатастрофе, когда погибли твои родители», - сказала она. «И не задавай вопросов».\n\nНе задавайте вопросов, это было первое правило спокойной жизни с Дурслями.\n\nДядя Вернон вошел на кухню, когда Гарри переворачивал бекон.\n\n«Расчешите волосы»! - рявкнул он в качестве утреннего приветствия.\n\nПримерно раз в неделю дядя Вернон просматривал газету и кричал, что Гарри нужно постричься. У Гарри, должно быть, было больше стрижек, чем у остальных мальчиков в его классе вместе взятых, но это не имело значения, его волосы просто росли таким образом, повсюду.\n\nГарри жарил яйца к тому времени, когда Дадли прибыл на кухню с его матерью. Дадли был очень похож на дядю Вернона. У него было большое розовое лицо, небольшая шея, маленькие водянистые голубые глаза и густые светлые волосы, плавно ложившиеся на его толстую толстую голову. Тетя Петуния часто говорила, что Дадли похож на маленького ангела, Гарри часто говорил, что Дадли похож на свинью в парике.\n\nГарри поставил тарелки с яйцом и беконом на стол, что было трудно, так как места было мало. Дадли тем временем считал свои подарки. Его лицо упало.\n\n«Тридцать шесть», - сказал он, глядя на мать и отца. «Это на два меньше, чем в прошлом году».\n\n«Милый, ты не посчитал подарок тети Мардж, видишь ли, он здесь, под этим большим подарком от мамы и папы».\n\n- Хорошо, тогда тридцать семь, - сказал Дадли, покраснев. Гарри, который видел надвигающуюся истерику Дадли, начал как можно быстрее съесть свой бекон на случай, если Дадли перевернет стол.\n\nТетя Петуния, очевидно, тоже почувствовала опасность, потому что она быстро сказала: «И мы купим тебе еще два подарка, пока нас не будет. Как это, попкин? Еще два подарка. Все в порядке?\n\nДадли на мгновение задумался. Это было похоже на тяжелую работу. В конце концов он медленно сказал: «Значит, у меня будет тридцать, тридцать».\n\n«Тридцать девять, сладкие», - сказала тетя Петуния.\n\n\"Ой\". Дадли тяжело сел и схватил ближайший сверток. \"Тогда все в порядке\".\n\nДядя Вернон усмехнулся. «Маленький тычок, как и его отец, хочет окупить свои деньги. «Атта, мальчик, Дадли»! Он взъерошил волосы Дадли.\n\nВ этот момент зазвонил телефон, и тетя Петуния подошла к нему, а Гарри и дядя Вернон наблюдали, как Дадли разворачивает гоночный байк, видеокамеру, самолет с дистанционным управлением, шестнадцать новых компьютерных игр и видеомагнитофон. Он срывал бумажку с золотых наручных часов, когда тетя Петуния вернулась от телефона, выглядя одновременно сердитой и встревоженной.\n\n«Плохие новости, Вернон», - сказала она. «Миссис Фигг сломала ногу. Она не может взять его ». Она кивнула в сторону Гарри.\n\nРот Дадли открылся от ужаса, но сердце Гарри подпрыгнуло. Каждый год в день рождения Дадли родители брали его и друга на день в парки приключений, гамбургерные рестораны или в кино. Каждый год Гарри оставался с миссис Фигг, безумной старушкой, которая жила через две улицы. Гарри ненавидел это там. Во всем доме пахло капустой, и миссис Фигг заставила его взглянуть на фотографии всех кошек, которые у нее когда-либо были.\n\n\"Что теперь\"? - сказала тетя Петуния, яростно глядя на Гарри, как будто он это все спланировал. Гарри знал, что ему следовало бы пожалеть о том, что миссис Фигг сломала ногу, но это было нелегко, когда он напомнил себе, что пройдет целый год, прежде чем ему придется снова взглянуть на Тибблса, Сноуи, Мистера Лапки и Тафти.\n\n«Мы могли бы позвонить Мардж», - предложил дядя Вернон.\n\n«Не будь дураком, Вернон, она ненавидит мальчика».\n\nДурсли часто говорили о Гарри так, как будто его там не было, или, скорее, как будто он был чем-то очень противным, что не могло их понять, как слизняк.\n\n«Как насчет того, как ее зовут, твоя подруга Ивонн»?\n\n«В отпуске на Майорке», - огрызнулась тетя Петуния.\n\n«Ты можешь просто оставить меня здесь», - вставил Гарри с надеждой (для разнообразия он сможет посмотреть то, что он хочет, по телевизору и, возможно, даже поиграть на компьютере Дадли).\n\nТетя Петуния выглядела так, словно только что проглотила лимон.\n\n«И вернуться и найти дом в руинах»? - прорычала она.\n\n«Я не взорву дом», - сказал Гарри, но они не слушали.\n\n«Думаю, мы могли бы отвезти его в зоопарк, - медленно сказала тетя Петуния, - и оставить в машине».\n\n«Эта машина новая, он не сидит в ней один».\n\nДадли начал громко плакать. На самом деле, он действительно не плакал, прошли годы с тех пор, как он действительно плакал, но он знал, что, если он скривится и причитает, его мать даст ему все, что он хочет.\n\n«Динки Даддидамс, не плачь, мама не позволит ему испортить тебе особенный день»! - воскликнула она, обнимая его.\n\n«Я, не хочу, его, т-приехать»! Дадли закричал сквозь громкие притворные рыдания. «Он всегда все портит»! Он одарил Гарри мерзкой ухмылкой сквозь щель в руках матери.\n\nВ этот момент раздался звонок в дверь: «О, Господи, они здесь»! - в отчаянии сказала тетя Петуния, и мгновение спустя лучший друг Дадли, Пирс Полкисс, вошел с его матерью. Пирс был тощим мальчиком с крысиным лицом. Обычно он держал людей за спину, пока Дадли бил их. Дадли сразу же перестал притворяться плачущим.\n\nПолчаса спустя Гарри, который не мог поверить в свою удачу, сидел на заднем сиденье машины Дурслей с Пирсом и Дадли, впервые в своей жизни направляясь в зоопарк. Его тетя и дядя не могли придумать, что еще иметь с ним дело, но перед их отъездом дядя Вернон отвел Гарри в сторону.\n\n«Я предупреждаю тебя, - сказал он, приближая свое большое пурпурное лицо к Гарри, - я предупреждаю тебя сейчас, мальчик, о любых забавных делах, о чем угодно, и ты будешь в этом шкафу от теперь до Рождества.\n\n«Я не собираюсь ничего делать, - сказал Гарри, - честно».\n\nНо дядя Вернон ему не поверил. Никто никогда не делал.\n\nПроблема заключалась в том, что вокруг Гарри часто происходили странные вещи, и было бесполезно говорить Дурслям, что он не заставлял их происходить.\n\nОднажды тетя Петуния, уставшая от того, что Гарри возвращался из парикмахерских с таким видом, будто его и не было, взяла кухонные ножницы и так коротко подстригла его волосы, что он стал почти лысым, за исключением челки, которую она оставила « чтобы скрыть этот ужасный шрам ». Дадли глупо посмеялся над Гарри, который провел бессонную ночь, представляя школу на следующий день, где над ним уже смеялись из-за его мешковатой одежды и очков с лентой. На следующее утро, однако, он проснулся и обнаружил, что его волосы в точности такие, какими они были до того, как тетя Петуния остригла их. За это ему дали неделю в шкафу, хотя он пытался объяснить, что не может объяснить, как это так быстро выросло.\n\nВ другой раз тетя Петуния пыталась заставить его надеть отвратительный старый свитер Дадли (коричневый с оранжевыми клубками). Чем сильнее она пыталась натянуть его на его голову, тем он казался меньше, пока, наконец, не подошел ручная марионетка, но Гарри точно не подойдет. Тетя Петуния решила, что он, должно быть, уменьшился после стирки, и, к его огромному облегчению, Гарри не был наказан.\n\nС другой стороны, он попал в ужасную беду из-за того, что его нашли на крыше школьной кухни. Банда Дадли преследовала его, как обычно, когда, к удивлению Гарри, как и всех остальных, он сидел на дымоходе. Дурсли получили очень гневное письмо от директора Гарри, в котором говорилось, что Гарри лазил по школьным зданиям. Но все, что он пытался сделать (когда он кричал на дядю Вернона через запертую дверь своего шкафа), это прыгнуть за большие мусорные баки за дверью кухни. Гарри предположил, что ветер, должно быть, подхватил его в середине прыжка.\n\nНо сегодня ничего не могло пойти не так. С Дадли и Пирсом даже стоило провести день где-нибудь, кроме школы, его шкафа или гостиной миссис Фигг, пахнущей капустой.\n\nПока он ехал, дядя Вернон пожаловался тете Петунии. Он любил жаловаться на вещи: люди на работе, Гарри, совет, Гарри, банк и Гарри были лишь некоторыми из его любимых предметов. Сегодня утром это были мотоциклы.\n\n«Ревущие, как маньяки, молодые хулиганы», - сказал он, когда их догнал мотоцикл.\n\n«Мне приснился мотоцикл, - внезапно вспомнил Гарри. «Он летел».\n\nДядя Вернон чуть не врезался в машину впереди. Он повернулся прямо на своем месте и крикнул Гарри, его лицо было похоже на гигантскую свеклу с усами: «МОТОЦИКЛЫ НЕ ЛЕТАТЬ»!\n\nДадли и Пирс захихикали.\n\n«Я знаю, что нет, - сказал Гарри. «Это был всего лишь сон».\n\nНо он пожалел, что не\n\nсказал что-нибудь. Если и было что-то, что Дурсли ненавидели даже больше, чем то, что он задавал вопросы, так это то, что он говорил о чем-либо, действуя так, как не следовало бы, независимо от того, было ли это во сне или даже в мультфильме, они, казалось, думали, что он может получить опасные идеи.\nБыла очень солнечная суббота, и зоопарк был переполнен семьями. Дурсли купили у Дадли и Пирса большое шоколадное мороженое у входа, а затем, поскольку улыбающаяся дама в фургоне спросила Гарри, что он хочет, прежде чем они успели его поторопить, они купили ему дешевое лимонное мороженое. «Это тоже неплохо», - подумал Гарри, облизывая его, когда они наблюдали, как горилла почесывала себе голову, которая была удивительно похожа на Дадли, за исключением того, что она не была блондинкой.\n\nУ Гарри было лучшее утро за долгое время. Он старался пройти немного дальше от Дурслей, чтобы Дадли и Пирс, которым к обеду стало скучно с животными, не вернулись к своему любимому хобби - ударить его. Они ели в ресторане зоопарка, и когда у Дадли случилась истерика из-за того, что на его славу трусиков не хватило мороженого, дядя Вернон купил ему еще одно, и Гарри разрешили закончить первое.\n\nВпоследствии Гарри почувствовал, что должен был знать, что все это слишком хорошо, чтобы продолжаться.\n\nПосле обеда они пошли в дом рептилий. Там было прохладно и темно, по стенам были освещены окна. За стеклом ползали и скользили по дереву и камню всевозможные ящерицы и змеи. Дадли и Пирс хотели увидеть огромных ядовитых кобр и толстых, сокрушающих человека питонов. Дадли быстро нашел самую большую змею в этом месте. Он мог дважды обернуть свое тело вокруг машины дяди Вернона и раздавить его в мусорное ведро, но в данный момент это было не в настроении. Фактически, это был крепкий сон.\n\nДадли стоял, прижавшись носом к стеклу, глядя на блестящие коричневые катушки.\n\n«Заставь его двигаться», - скулил он своему отцу. Дядя Вернон постучал по стеклу, но змея не двинулась с места.\n\n«Сделай это снова», - приказал Дадли. Дядя Вернон ловко постучал по стеклу костяшками пальцев, но змея просто дремала.\n\n«Это скучно», - простонал Дадли. Он поплелся прочь.\n\nГарри подошел к резервуару и пристально посмотрел на змею. Он не был бы удивлен, если бы оно умерло от самой скуки, ни одной компании, кроме глупых людей, барабанящих пальцами по стеклу, пытающихся потревожить его весь день. Это было хуже, чем иметь шкаф вместо спальни, где единственным посетителем была тетя Петуния, которая стучала в дверь, чтобы разбудить вас; по крайней мере, он должен посетить остальную часть дома.\n\nЗмея внезапно открыла глаза-бусинки. Медленно, очень медленно он поднял голову, пока его глаза не оказались на уровне глаз Гарри.\n\nОн подмигнул.\n\nГарри уставился. Затем он быстро огляделся, чтобы посмотреть, не наблюдает ли кто-нибудь. Их не было. Он снова посмотрел на змею и тоже подмигнул.\n\nЗмея кивнула в сторону дяди Вернона и Дадли, затем подняла глаза к потолку. Это дало Гарри взгляд, который довольно ясно говорил:\n\n«Я все время это понимаю. -\n\nЗнаю, - пробормотал Гарри через стекло, хотя и не был уверен, что змея его слышит. «Это должно быть действительно раздражает».\n\nЗмея энергично кивнула.\n\n- И вообще, откуда вы? - спросил Гарри.\n\nЗмея ткнула хвостом в маленькую табличку рядом со стеклом. Гарри всмотрелся в нее.\n\nБоа Констриктор, Бразилия.\n\n\"Было ли там хорошо\"?\n\nУдав снова ткнул хвостом в знак, и Гарри продолжил читать: Этот экземпляр был выведен в зоопарке. «О, понятно, значит, вы никогда не были в Бразилии»?\n\nКогда змея покачала головой, оглушительный крик позади Гарри заставил их обоих подпрыгнуть.\n\n«ДАДЛИ! МИСТЕР ДЕРСЛИ! Приходите и смотрите на эту змею! ВЫ НЕ ВЕРИТЕ, ЧТО ЭТО ДЕЛАЕТ! »\n\nДадли ковылял к ним так быстро, как только мог.\n\n- С дороги, ты, - сказал он, ударив Гарри по ребрам. Застигнутый врасплох, Гарри упал на бетонный пол. То, что было дальше, произошло так быстро, что никто не заметил, как это произошло, в одну секунду Пирс и Дадли наклонились вплотную к стеклу, в следующую они отскочили назад с воплями ужаса.\n\nГарри сел и ахнул; стеклянный фасад аквариума удава исчез. Огромная змея быстро разворачивалась и скользила по полу. Люди по всему дому рептилий закричали и бросились к выходу.\n\nКогда змея быстро проскользнула мимо него, Гарри мог поклясться, что низкий шипящий голос сказал: «Бразилия, вот и я. Спасибо, амиго».\n\nХозяйка рептилии была в шоке.\n\n«А вот стекло, - повторял он, - куда делось стекло»?\n\nДиректор зоопарка сам заварил тете Петунии чашку крепкого сладкого чая, снова и снова извиняясь. Пирс и Дадли могли только бормотать. Насколько Гарри заметил, змея ничего не сделала, кроме как игриво бросилась им вслед, но к тому времени, когда они все вернулись в машину дяди Вернона, Дадли рассказывал им, как она чуть не откусила ему ногу: пока Пирс ругался, он пытался прижать его до смерти. Но хуже всего, по крайней мере для Гарри, было то, что Пирс успокоился достаточно, чтобы сказать: «Гарри говорил с этим, не так ли, Гарри»?\n\nДядя Вернон подождал, пока Пирс благополучно выйдет из дома, прежде чем приступить к Гарри. Он был так зол, что едва мог говорить. Ему удалось сказать: «Иди, шкаф, останься, без еды», прежде чем он рухнул на стул, и тете Петунии пришлось бежать и принести ему большую порцию бренди.\n\nМного позже Гарри лежал в своем темном шкафу, мечтая о часах. Он не знал, который час, и не мог быть уверен, что Дурсли еще спят. Пока они не пришли, он не мог рискнуть прокрасться на кухню за едой.\n\nОн прожил с Дурслями почти десять лет, десять жалких лет, сколько себя помнил, с тех пор, как он был младенцем, и его родители погибли в той автокатастрофе. Он не мог вспомнить, как был в машине, когда его родители умерли. Иногда, когда он часами напрягал свою память в шкафу, ему приходило странное видение: ослепляющая вспышка зеленого света и жгучая боль во лбу. Он предположил, что это была авария, хотя он и представить себе не мог, откуда взялся зеленый свет. Он совершенно не мог вспомнить своих родителей. Его тетя и дядя никогда о них не говорили, и, конечно же, ему было запрещено задавать вопросы. Фотографий их в доме не было.\n\nКогда он был моложе, Гарри мечтал и мечтал о том, что какой-то неизвестный родственник придет, чтобы забрать его, но этого не произошло; Дурсли были его единственной семьей. Но иногда он думал (а может, надеялся), что незнакомцы на улице, кажется, знают его. Они тоже были очень странными незнакомцами. Крохотный человечек в фиолетовом цилиндре однажды поклонился ему, когда ходил по магазинам с тетей Петунией и Дадли. Яростно спросив Гарри, знает ли он этого человека, тетя Петуния поспешно выгнала их из магазина, ничего не купив. Однажды дикого вида старуха, одетая во все зеленое, весело помахала ему рукой в ​​автобусе. Лысый мужчина в очень длинном пурпурном пальто на днях действительно пожал руку на улице, а затем ушел, не сказав ни слова. Самым странным во всех этих людях было то, как они исчезли, когда Гарри попытался рассмотреть их поближе.\n\nВ школе у ​​Гарри никого не было. Все знали, что банда Дадли ненавидела этого странного Гарри Поттера в его мешковатой старой одежде и разбитых очках, и никто не любил спорить с бандой Дадли.\nПобег бразильского удава принес Гарри самое долгое наказание в истории. К тому времени, когда ему снова разрешили выйти из шкафа, начались летние каникулы, и Дадли уже сломал свою новую видеокамеру, разбил свой самолет с дистанционным управлением и, впервые выехав на своем гоночном велосипеде, сбил старую миссис Фигг, когда она пересекла Тисовую улицу на костылях.\n\nГарри был рад, что школа закончилась, но от банды Дадли, которая приходила в дом каждый божий день, никуда не деться. Пирс, Деннис, Малкольм и Гордон были большими и глупыми, но, поскольку Дадли был самым большим и глупым из всех, он был лидером. Остальные были счастливы присоединиться к любимому спорту Дадли: Гарри Хантингу.\n\nВот почему Гарри проводил как можно больше времени вне дома, бродил вокруг и думал о конце каникул, где он мог видеть крошечный лучик надежды. Когда наступит сентябрь, он пойдет в среднюю школу, и впервые в жизни его не будет с Дадли. Дадли был принят в старую частную школу дяди Вернона Смелтингс. Туда собирался и Пирс Полкисс. Гарри же, с другой стороны, учился в Стоунволл Хай, местной государственной школе. Дадли подумал, что это было очень забавно.\n\n«В первый день в Стоунволле они запихивают головы в унитаз, - сказал он Гарри. «Хотите подняться наверх и потренироваться»?\n\n«Нет, спасибо», - сказал Гарри. «В бедном туалете никогда не было ничего ужаснее твоей головы - это может быть больно». Затем он побежал, прежде чем Дадли смог сообразить, что он сказал.\n\nОднажды в июле тетя Петуния взяла Дадли в Лондон, чтобы купить ему форму Смелтингса, оставив Гарри у миссис Фигг. Миссис Фигг была не так плоха, как обычно. Оказалось, что она сломала ногу, споткнувшись об одну из своих кошек, и, похоже, она не так сильно их любила, как раньше. Она позволила Гарри посмотреть телевизор и дала ему шоколадный торт, который на вкус был так, как если бы он ел его несколько лет назад....\n\nВ тот вечер Дадли в своей новенькой униформе расхаживал по гостиной для всей семьи. Мальчики Смелтингса носили темно-бордовые фраки, оранжевые трусики и плоские соломенные шляпы, называемые канотье. У них также были бугорчатые палки, которыми они били друг друга, пока учителя не смотрели. Это должно было стать хорошей тренировкой для дальнейшей жизни.\n\nГлядя на Дадли в его новых штанах, дядя Вернон хрипло сказал, что это был самый гордый момент в его жизни. Тетя Петуния расплакалась и сказала, что не может поверить, что это ее Икл Дадлейкинс, он выглядел таким красивым и взрослым. Гарри не доверял себе говорить. Он подумал, что два его ребра, возможно, уже сломались из-за попытки не смеяться.\nНа следующее утро, когда Гарри пошел завтракать, на кухне стоял ужасный запах. Похоже, он исходил из большой металлической ванны в раковине. Он пошел посмотреть. В ванне было что-то вроде грязных тряпок, плавающих в серой воде.\n\n\"Что это\"? - спросил он у тети Петунии. Ее губы сжались, как всегда, если он осмеливался задать вопрос.\n\n«Твоя новая школьная форма», - сказала она.\n\nГарри снова заглянул в миску.\n\n«О, - сказал он, - я и не думал, что он должен быть таким влажным».\n\n«Не будь дурой», - огрызнулась тетя Петуния. «Я крашу для тебя некоторые старые вещи Дадли в серый цвет. Когда я закончу, он будет выглядеть как все ».\n\nГарри серьезно в этом сомневался, но решил, что лучше не спорить. Он сел за стол и постарался не думать о том, как он будет выглядеть в свой первый день в Стоунволл Хай - вероятно, как будто на нем были кусочки старой слоновой кожи.\n\nВошли Дадли и дядя Вернон, оба с морщинистыми носами из-за запаха новой формы Гарри. Дядя Вернон, как обычно, открыл свою газету, и Дадли стукнул плавильной палкой, которую он носил повсюду, по столу.\n\nОни услышали щелчок прорези для почты и стук писем на коврике.\n\n«Получи почту, Дадли», - сказал дядя Вернон из-за своей газеты.\n\n«Заставь Гарри понять».\n\n«Получи почту, Гарри».\n\n«Заставь Дадли понять».\n\n«Ткните его своей плавильной палкой, Дадли».\n\nГарри увернулся от Плавильной палки и пошел за почтой. На коврике лежали три вещи: открытка от сестры дяди Вернона Мардж, которая отдыхала на острове Уайт, коричневый конверт, похожий на счет, и - письмо для Гарри. Гарри поднял его и уставился на него, его сердце колотилось, как гигантская резинка. Никто никогда за всю его жизнь не писал ему. Кто будет? У него не было ни друзей, ни других родственников - он не принадлежал к библиотеке, поэтому никогда не получал даже грубых записок с просьбами вернуть книги. Но вот это письмо, адресованное так ясно, что не могло быть никакой ошибки:\n\nМистер Гарри Поттер,\n\n«Шкаф под лестницей»,\n\n4\n\nТисовая улица, Литтл-Уингинг,\n\nСуррей.\n\nКонверт был толстым и тяжелым, сделан из желтоватого пергамента, а адрес был написан изумрудно-зелеными чернилами. Штампа не было.\n\nПеревернув конверт дрожащей рукой, Гарри увидел фиолетовую сургучную печать с гербом; лев, орел, барсук и змея, окружающие большую букву H\n\n«Поторопись, мальчик»! - крикнул дядя Вернон из кухни. «Что ты делаешь, проверяешь письма-бомбы»? Он усмехнулся собственной шутке.\n\nГарри вернулся на кухню, все еще глядя на свое письмо. Он протянул дяде Вернону счет и открытку, сел и медленно начал открывать желтый конверт.\n\nДядя Вернон вскрыл банкноту, с отвращением фыркнул и перевернул открытку.\n\n«Мардж больна», - сообщил он тете Петунии. «Съел забавного щенка».\n\n«Папа»! - внезапно сказал Дадли. «Папа, у Гарри что-то есть»!\n\nГарри собирался развернуть свое письмо, написанное на том же тяжелом пергаменте, что и конверт, когда дядя Вернон резко выдернул его из его руки.\n\n\"Это мое\"! - сказал Гарри, пытаясь вернуть его.\n\n«Кто бы вам писал»? - усмехнулся дядя Вернон, одной рукой потрясая письмо и глядя на него. Его лицо из красного превратилось в зеленый быстрее, чем светофор. И это еще не все. Через несколько секунд он превратился в серовато-белый цвет старой каши.\n\n«ПП-Петуния»! он ахнул.\n\nДадли попытался схватить письмо, чтобы прочитать его, но дядя Вернон держал его подальше от досягаемости. Тетя Петуния с любопытством прочитала первую строчку. На мгновение показалось, что она вот-вот упадет в обморок. Она схватилась за горло и задохнулась.\n\n«Вернон! О боже мой - Вернон!\n\nОни уставились друг на друга, словно забыли, что Гарри и Дадли все еще были в комнате. Дадли не привык, чтобы его игнорировали. Он резко ударил отца по голове своей плавильной палкой.\n\n«Я хочу прочитать это письмо», - громко сказал он.\n\n«Я хочу прочитать это, - яростно сказал Гарри, - поскольку это мое».\n\n- Уходите, вы оба, - прохрипел дядя Вернон, запихивая письмо обратно в конверт.\n\nГарри не двинулся с места.\n\n«ХОЧУ МОЕ ПИСЬМО»! он крикнул.\n\n\"Позволь мне увидеть это\"! потребовал Дадли.\n\n\"ИЗ\"! - взревел дядя Вернон, схватил Гарри и Дадли за шкирки и швырнул их в холл, захлопнув за ними кухонную дверь. Гарри и Дадли сразу же затеяли яростную, но безмолвную борьбу за то, кто будет слушать в замочную скважину; Дадли победил, поэтому Гарри, его очки болтались с одного уха, лег на живот и прислушивался к щели между дверью и полом.\n\n«Вернон, - дрожащим голосом говорила тетя Петуния, - посмотри на адрес - откуда им знать, где он спит? Вы не думаете, что они следят за домом »?\n\n«Наблюдение - шпионаж- может преследовать нас», - дико пробормотал дядя Вернон.\n\n«Но что нам делать, Вернон? Мы должны ответить? Скажи им, что мы не хотим -\n\nГарри видел, как блестящие черные туфли дяди Вернона расхаживали взад и вперед по кухне.\n\n«Нет», - наконец сказал он. «Нет, мы проигнорируем это. Если они не получат ответа, да, так лучше; мы ничего не будем делать; ».\n\n«Но - »\n\n«У меня нет дома, Петуния! Разве мы не клялись, когда забирали его, что искореним эту опасную чушь »?\n\nВ тот вечер, когда он вернулся с работы, дядя Вернон сделал то, чего никогда раньше не делал; он посетил Гарри в его шкафу.\n\n«Где мое письмо»? - сказал Гарри в тот момент, когда дядя Вернон протиснулся в дверь. «Кто мне пишет»?\n\n\"Никто. - Оно было адресовано вам по ошибке, - коротко сказал дядя Вернон. «Я сжег это».\n\n«Это не было ошибкой, - сердито сказал Гарри, - на нем был мой шкаф».\n\n«ТИШИНА»! - заорал дядя Вернон, и с потолка упала пара пауков. Он сделал несколько глубоких вдохов, а затем заставил свое лицо улыбнуться, что выглядело довольно болезненно.\n\n- Э - да, Гарри, об этом шкафу. Мы с твоей тетей думали; ты действительно становишься немного большим для этого; мы думаем, было бы неплохо, если бы вы переехали во вторую спальню Дадли ».\n\n\"Почему\"? - сказал Гарри.\n\n«Не задавай вопросов»! - отрезал дядя. «Сейчас же возьми это наверх».\n\nВ доме Дурслей было четыре спальни: одна для дяди Вернона и тети Петунии, одна для посетителей (обычно сестра дяди Вернона, Мардж), одна, где спал Дадли, и одна, где Дадли хранил все игрушки и вещи, которые не помещались в его доме первая спальня. Гарри потребовалось всего одно путешествие наверх, чтобы перенести все, что у него было из шкафа в эту комнату. Он сел на кровать и огляделся. Здесь почти все было сломано. Видеокамера месячной давности лежала на небольшом работающем танке, на котором Дадли однажды переехал собаку соседа; в углу был первый телевизор Дадли, в который он проткнул ногу, когда его любимая программа была отменена; там была большая птичья клетка, в которой когда-то сидел попугай, которого Дадли в школе обменял на настоящую пневматическую винтовку, который был на полке с загнутым концом, потому что Дадли сидел на нем. Другие полки были заполнены книгами. Они были единственными вещами в комнате, которые выглядели так, как будто к ним никогда не прикасались.\n\nСнизу доносился звук, как Дадли кричал на свою мать: «Я не хочу, чтобы он здесь; Мне нужна эта комната; заставить его уйти; ».\n\nГарри вздохнул и растянулся на кровати. Вчера он отдал бы все, чтобы быть здесь. Сегодня он предпочел бы вернуться в свой шкаф с этим письмом, чем здесь без него.\n\nНа следующее утро за завтраком все притихли. Дадли был в шоке. Он кричал, бил своего отца плавильной палкой, умышленно болел, пинал мать и швырял черепаху через крышу теплицы, но ему все еще не вернули свою комнату. Вчера Гарри думал об этом времени и с горечью сожалел, что открыл письмо в холле. Дядя Вернон и тетя Петуния мрачно смотрели друг на друга.\n\nКогда пришло письмо, дядя Вернон, который, казалось, старался быть милым с Гарри, заставил Дадли пойти и забрать его. Они слышали, как он стучал плавильной палкой по всему коридору. Затем он крикнул: «Есть еще один! 'Г-н. H, Поттер, Самая маленькая спальня, Тисовая улица, 4 -\n\nДядя Вернон с задушенным криком вскочил со своего места и побежал по коридору, Гарри - прямо за ним. Дяде Вернону пришлось повалить Дадли на землю, чтобы получить от него письмо, что было затруднительно из-за того, что Гарри схватил дядю Вернона сзади за шею. После минуты запутанной борьбы, в которой всех сильно ударила плавильная палка, дядя Вернон выпрямился, задыхаясь, сжимая в руке письмо Гарри.\n\n«Иди в свой шкаф - я имею в виду в спальню», - прохрипел он Гарри. «Дадли, давай, уходи».\n\nГарри ходил по своей новой комнате. Кто-то знал, что он переехал из шкафа, и, похоже, знали, что он не получил свое первое письмо. Неужели это означало, что они попробуют еще раз? И на этот раз он позаботится о том, чтобы они не проиграли. У него был план.\n\nОтремонтированный будильник зазвонил в шесть часов утра. Гарри быстро выключил его и молча оделся. Он не должен будить Дурслей. Он спустился вниз, не включив ни одного света.\n\nОн собирался дождаться почтальона на углу Тисовой улицы и сначала достать буквы для номера четыре. Его сердце колотилось, когда он пробирался через темный холл к входной\n\nдвери - «ААААААРРРГ»!\n\nГарри прыгнул в воздух; он наступил на коврик на что-то большое и мягкое - на что-то живое!\n\nНаверху зажегся свет, и Гарри, к своему ужасу, понял, что это большое, мягкое что-то было лицом его дяди. Дядя Вернон лежал у подножия входной двери в спальном мешке, явно следя за тем, чтобы Гарри не делал именно то, что пытался сделать. Он кричал на Гарри около получаса, а затем сказал ему пойти и приготовить чашку чая. Гарри с несчастным видом поплелся на кухню, и к тому времени, когда он вернулся, почта прибыла прямо на колени дяде Вернону. Гарри увидел три письма, написанные зелеными чернилами.\n\n«Я хочу - » - начал он, но дядя Вернон рвал буквы на куски прямо у него на глазах.\n\nДядя Вернон в тот день не пошел на работу. Он остался дома и прибил почтовый ящик.\n\n«Видишь ли, - объяснил он тете Петунии, забивая гвозди, - если они не смогут доставить их, они просто сдадутся».\n\n«Я не уверен, что это сработает, Вернон».\n\n«О, у этих людей странная работа, Петуния, они не такие, как ты и я», - сказал дядя Вернон, пытаясь забить гвоздь кусочком кекса, который ему только что принесла тетя Петуния.\n\nВ пятницу Гарри пришло не менее двенадцати писем. Поскольку они не могли пройти через прорезь для почты, их протолкнули под дверь, проделали через боковые щели, а некоторых даже вытолкнули через маленькое окно в ванной на первом этаже.\n\nДядя Вернон снова остался дома. Сожгив все буквы, он достал молоток и гвозди и заделал трещины вокруг передней и задней дверей, чтобы никто не мог выйти. Во время работы он напевал «На цыпочках сквозь тюльпаны» и прыгал от небольшого шума.\n\nВ субботу дела стали выходить из-под контроля. Двадцать четыре письма к Гарри попали в дом, свернутые и спрятанные внутри каждого из двух дюжин яиц, которые их очень сбитый с толку молочник передал тете Петунии через окно гостиной. Пока дядя Вернон яростно звонил на почту и в молочный завод, пытаясь найти кого-нибудь, кому можно было бы пожаловаться, тетя Петуния измельчала письма в кухонном комбайне.\n\n«Кто на свете так хочет с тобой разговаривать»? - удивленно спросил Дадли у Гарри.\nВ воскресенье утром дядя Вернон сел за стол для завтрака, выглядя усталым и довольно больным, но счастливым.\n\n«Никакой почты по воскресеньям», - бодро напомнил он им,\n\nразливая мармелад по газетам, - «никаких чертовых писем сегодня.» Что-то пролетело по кухонной трубе, пока он говорил, и резко ударил его по затылку. В следующий момент тридцать или сорок букв вылетели из камина, как пули. Дурсли пригнулись, но Гарри подпрыгнул в воздухе, пытаясь поймать одного-\n\n«Вон! ИЗ\"!\n\nДядя Вернон схватил Гарри за талию и швырнул в холл. Когда тетя Петуния и Дадли выбежали, закрыв руки руками, дядя Вернон захлопнул дверь. Они могли слышать, как буквы все еще текут в комнату, отскакивая от стен и пола.\n\n«Вот и все», - сказал дядя Вернон, пытаясь говорить спокойно, но в то же время выдергивая большие пучки из усов. «Я хочу, чтобы вы все вернулись сюда через пять минут и были готовы к отъезду. Мы уезжаем. Просто собери немного одежды. Никаких аргументов »!\n\nОн выглядел так опасно с отсутствующей половиной усов, что никто не осмеливался спорить. Десять минут спустя они прорвались через заколоченные двери и ехали в машине, мчащейся к шоссе. Дадли всхлипывал на заднем сиденье; его отец ударил его по голове за то, что он держал их, когда он пытался упаковать свой телевизор, видеомагнитофон и компьютер в спортивную сумку.\n\nОни поехали. И они поехали. Даже тетя Петуния не осмелилась спросить, куда они собирались. Время от времени дядя Вернон резко поворачивал и какое-то время ехал в противоположном направлении.\n\n«Стряхните их; избавься от них, - бормотал он всякий раз, когда делал это.\n\nОни не останавливались, чтобы есть или пить весь день. К ночи Дадли выл. У него никогда в жизни не было такого плохого дня. Он был голоден, он пропустил пять телепрограмм, которые хотел посмотреть, и никогда не уходил так долго, чтобы не взорвать инопланетянина на своем компьютере.\n\nДядя Вернон наконец остановился у мрачного отеля на окраине большого города. Дадли и Гарри делили комнату с двумя односпальными кроватями и влажными, затхлыми простынями. Дадли храпел, но Гарри не спал, сидя на подоконнике, глядя на огни проезжающих машин и размышляя; .\n\nНа следующий день на завтрак они ели черствые кукурузные хлопья и холодные консервированные помидоры с тостами. Они только закончили, когда к их столику подошел хозяин гостиницы.\n\n«Извините, но один из вас мистер Гарри Поттер? Только я получил об этом на стойке регистрации ».\n\nОна подняла письмо, чтобы они могли прочитать адрес , написанный зелеными чернилами:\n\nМистер Гарри Поттер,\n\nкомната 17,\n\nотель «Рейлвью»,\n\nКокворт.\n\nГарри попытался схватить письмо, но дядя Вернон сбил его руку с пути. Женщина смотрела.\n\n«Я возьму их», - сказал дядя Вернон, быстро вставая и следуя за ней из столовой.\n«Не лучше ли пойти домой, дорогой»? Несколько часов спустя робко предложила тетя Петуния, но дядя Вернон, похоже, ее не слышал. Никто из них не знал, что именно он искал. Он загнал их в середину леса, вышел, огляделся, покачал головой, вернулся в машину, и они снова поехали. То же самое произошло посреди вспаханного поля, на полпути по подвесному мосту и наверху многоуровневого гаража.\n\n«Папа сошел с ума, не так ли»? - тупо спросил Дадли у тети Петунии поздно вечером. Дядя Вернон припарковался на берегу, запер всех в машине и исчез.\n\nНачался дождь. По крыше машины бьют большие капли. Дадли хмыкнул.\n\n«Сегодня понедельник», - сказал он матери. «Великий Умберто сегодня вечером. Я хочу остаться где-нибудь с телевизором ».\n\nПонедельник. Это что-то напомнило Гарри. Если это был понедельник - а Дадли обычно знает дни недели из-за телевидения, - то завтра, вторник, будет одиннадцатый день рождения Гарри. Конечно, дни его рождения никогда не были особенно веселыми - в прошлом году Дурсли подарили ему вешалку для одежды и пару старых носков дяди Вернона. И все же тебе не было одиннадцати каждый день.\n\nДядя Вернон вернулся и улыбался. У него также был длинный тонкий сверток, и он не ответил тете Петунии, когда она спросила, что он купил.\n\n«Нашел идеальное место»! он сказал. \"Давай! Все вон »!\n\nЗа пределами машины было очень холодно. Дядя Вернон указывал на нечто похожее на большую скалу в море. На вершине скалы стояла самая жалкая хижина, которую только можно представить. Одно можно было сказать наверняка: там не было телевизора.\n\n«Прогноз шторма на ночь»! - радостно сказал дядя Вернон, хлопая в ладоши. «И этот господин любезно согласился одолжить нам свою лодку»!\n\nК ним подошел беззубый старик и указал с довольно злой ухмылкой на старую гребную лодку, покачивающуюся в серо-железной воде под ними.\n\n«У меня уже есть пайки, - сказал дядя Вернон, - так что все на борт»!\n\nВ лодке было холодно. Ледяные морские брызги и дождь ползли по их шеям, а холодный ветер хлестал их лица. По прошествии нескольких часов они достигли скалы, где дядя Вернон, поскользнувшись, направился к разрушенному дому.\n\nВнутри было ужасно; Здесь сильно пахло водорослями, ветер свистел сквозь щели в деревянных стенах, а в камине было сыро и пусто. Было всего две комнаты.\n\nПайками дяди Вернона оказались по пакету чипсов и четыре банана. Он попытался разжечь огонь, но пустые пакеты для чипсов просто задымились и сморщились.\n\n«Могли бы теперь сделать некоторые из этих писем, а»? - весело сказал он.\n\nОн был в очень хорошем настроении. Очевидно, он думал, что ни у кого нет шанса добраться до них здесь во время шторма, чтобы доставить почту. Гарри в частном порядке согласился, хотя эта мысль нисколько не взбодрила его.\n\nС наступлением ночи вокруг них разразился обещанный шторм. Брызги высоких волн забрызгали стены хижины, сильный ветер стучал в грязные окна. Тетя Петуния нашла во второй комнате несколько заплесневелых одеял и застелила Дадли постель на изъеденном молью софе. Она и дядя Вернон отправились на комковатую кровать по соседству, а Гарри оставалось найти самый мягкий кусок пола и свернуться калачиком под самым тонким и рваным одеялом.\n\nС наступлением ночи буря бушевала все более и более яростно. Гарри не мог уснуть. Он вздрогнул и перевернулся, пытаясь устроиться поудобнее, его живот урчал от голода. Храп Дадли заглушили низкие раскаты грома, разразившиеся около полуночи. Светящийся циферблат часов Дадли, свисавший с края дивана на его толстом запястье, сообщал Гарри, что через десять минут ему будет одиннадцать. Он лежал и смотрел, как приближается его день рождения, гадая, вспомнят ли Дурсли вообще, гадая, где сейчас писатель письма.\n\nОсталось пять минут. Гарри услышал снаружи какой-то скрип. Он надеялся, что крыша не обвалится, хотя, возможно, ему было бы теплее. Осталось четыре минуты. Может быть, когда они вернутся, в доме на Тисовой улице будет столько писем, что он как-нибудь сможет украсть одно.\n\nОсталось три минуты. Неужели это море так сильно бьется о скалу? И (осталось две минуты), что это был за странный хруст? Неужели скала рушилась в море?\n\nОсталась одна минута, и ему будет одиннадцать. Тридцать секунд; 20 ; 10 ; девять - может, он разбудит Дадли, просто чтобы рассердить его - три; два ; один ;\n\nБУМ.\n\nВся хижина задрожала, и Гарри резко выпрямился, глядя на дверь. Кто-то был снаружи и стучал, чтобы войти.\n\nБУМ. Они снова постучали. Дадли резко проснулся. «Где пушка»? - глупо сказал он.\n\nПозади них раздался грохот, и дядя Вернон влетел в комнату. В руках он держал винтовку - теперь они знали, что было в длинном тонком пакете, который он принес с собой.\n\n\"Кто здесь\"? он крикнул. «Предупреждаю - я вооружен»!\n\nНаступила пауза. Затем -\n\nРАЗБИРАТЬ!\n\nДверь ударилась с такой силой, что она сорвалась с петель и с оглушительным грохотом приземлилась на пол.\n\nВ дверях стоял гигантский мужчина. Его лицо было почти полностью скрыто длинной косматой гривой волос и дикой спутанной бородой, но его глаза блестели, как черные жуки, под всеми волосами.\n\nВеликан протиснулся в хижину, наклонившись так, что его голова едва коснулась потолка. Он нагнулся, поднял дверь и легко вставил ее обратно в раму. Шум шторма снаружи немного утих. Он повернулся, чтобы посмотреть на них всех.\n\n«Не могли бы вы приготовить нам чашку чая? Это было нелегкое путешествие. . ».\n\nОн подошел к дивану, на котором замер от страха сидел Дадли.\n\n«Поднимайся, большой кусок», - сказал незнакомец.\n\nДадли пискнул и побежал спрятаться за спиной своей матери, которая в ужасе приседала за дядей Верноном.\n\n«А вот и Гарри»! сказал гигант.\n\nГарри взглянул на свирепое, дикое, темное лицо и увидел, что глаза жука сморщились в улыбке.\n\n«В последний раз, когда я видел тебя, ты был всего лишь младенцем», - сказал великан. «Ты очень похож на своего отца, но у тебя глаза мамы».\n\nДядя Вернон издал забавный скрипучий звук.\n\n«Я требую, чтобы вы немедленно ушли, сэр»! он сказал. «Вы взламываете и входите»!\n\n«Ах, заткнись, Дурсль, большой чернослив», - сказал великан; он потянулся через спинку дивана, выдернул ружье из рук дяди Вернона, завязал его в узел так легко, как если бы он был сделан из резины, и швырнул его в угол комнаты.\n\nДядя Вернон издал еще один забавный звук, как будто наступили на мышь.\n\n- В любом случае- Гарри, - сказал великан, поворачиваясь спиной к Дурслям, - очень поздравляю тебя с днем ​​рождения. Получил summat for yeh здесь - возможно, я когда-то на нем сидел, но вкус будет неплохой ».\n\nИз внутреннего кармана своего черного пальто он вытащил слегка раздавленную коробку. Гарри открыл его дрожащими пальцами. Внутри был большой липкий шоколадный торт с надписью «С Днем Рождения, Гарри» зеленой глазурью.\n\nГарри взглянул на гиганта. Он хотел сказать спасибо, но слова потерялись на пути к его рту, и вместо этого он сказал: «Кто ты»?\n\nВеликан усмехнулся.\n\n«Правда, я не представился. Рубеус Хагрид, хранитель ключей и земель в Хогвартсе ».\n\nОн протянул огромную руку и потряс Гарри за руку.\n\n«А как насчет того чая, а»? - сказал он, потирая руки. «Я бы не сказал« no ter summat »сильнее, если он у тебя есть».\n\nЕго взгляд упал на пустую решетку со сморщенными мешками для чипсов, и он фыркнул. Он наклонился над камином; они не могли видеть, что он делал, но когда он отступил секундой позже, там горел огонь. Он наполнил всю сырую хижину мерцающим светом, и Гарри почувствовал, как его накатило тепло, словно он погрузился в горячую ванну.\n\nВеликан снова сел на диван, прогнувшийся под его весом, и стал вынимать из карманов пальто всякие вещи: медный чайник, мягкий пакет сосисок, кочергу, чайник, несколько кружек со сколами, и бутылка янтарной жидкости, из которой он сделал глоток, прежде чем начать заваривать чай. Вскоре хижина наполнилась звуком и запахом шипящей колбасы. Пока великан работал, никто ничего не сказал, но, вытаскивая из кочерги первые шесть жирных, сочных, слегка подгоревших сосисок, Дадли немного заерзал. Дядя Вернон резко сказал: «Не трогай ничего, что он тебе дает, Дадли».\n\nВеликан мрачно усмехнулся.\n\n«Твоему хорошему сыну не нужно больше откармливать, Дурсль, не волнуйся».\n\nОн передал сосиски Гарри, который был так голоден, что никогда не пробовал ничего более чудесного, но все еще не мог отвести глаз от гиганта. В конце концов, так как никто не собирался ничего объяснять, он сказал: «Мне очень жаль, но я все еще не знаю, кто вы».\n\nГигант сделал глоток чая и вытер рот тыльной стороной ладони.\n\n«Зовите меня Хагрид, - сказал он, - все так делают. «Как я уже сказал, я хранитель ключей в Хогвартсе - вы, конечно, все знаете о Хогвартсе».\n\n- Э- нет, - сказал Гарри.\n\nХагрид выглядел потрясенным.\n\n«Извини», - быстро сказал Гарри.\n\n\"Сожалею\"? - рявкнул Хагрид, поворачиваясь к Дурслям, которые отступили в тень. «Это им как следует извиняться! Я знал, что ты не получаешь писем, но никогда не думал, что ты даже не узнаешь о Хогвартсе, черт возьми! Разве вы никогда не задумывались, откуда родители все это узнали »?\n\n«Все что»? - спросил Гарри.\n\n«ВСЕ ЧТО»? - прогремел Хагрид. «А теперь подожди одну секунду»!\n\nОн вскочил на ноги. В гневе он, казалось, заполнил всю хижину. Дурсли прижались к стене.\n\n«Вы хотите сказать мне, - прорычал он Дурслям, - что этот мальчик - этот мальчик! - ничего не знает ни о чем»?\n\nГарри подумал, что это заходит слишком далеко. В конце концов, он был в школе, и его оценки были неплохими.\n\n«Я кое-что знаю, - сказал он. «Я могу заниматься математикой и прочим». Но Хагрид просто махнул рукой и сказал: «Я имею в виду наш мир. Твой мир. Мой Мир. Мир твоих родителей ».\n\n«Какой мир»?\n\nХагрид выглядел так, будто вот-вот взорвется.\n\n«ДУРСЛИ»! - прогремел он.\n\nДядя Вернон, который сильно побледнел, прошептал что-то вроде «Мимблвимбл». Хагрид дико уставился на Гарри.\n\n«Но ты должен знать о своих маме и папе», - сказал он. «Я имею в виду, они знамениты. Ты знаменит ».\n\n\"Какая? Мои- мои мама и папа не были знаменитостями, не так ли »?\n\n«Ага, не знаю; да не знаю. . ». Хагрид провел пальцами по волосам, недоуменно глядя на Гарри.\n\n«Ты не знаешь, кто ты»? - сказал он наконец.\n\nДядя Вернон внезапно обрел голос.\n\n\"Стоп\"! - скомандовал он. «Стой, садись! Я запрещаю тебе что-либо рассказывать мальчику »!\n\nЧеловек более храбрый, чем Вернон Дурслей, вздрогнул бы от яростного взгляда Хагрида; когда Хагрид заговорил, каждый его слог дрожал от ярости.\n\n«Вы никогда не говорили ему? Так и не сказал ему, что было в письме, которое Дамблдор оставил ему? Я был там! Я видел, как Дамблдор оставил его, Дурсль! «Вы скрывали это от него все эти годы»?\n\n«Что скрыл от меня»? - нетерпеливо сказал Гарри.\n\n\"СТОП! Я ЗАПРЕЩАЮ ВАМ »! - в панике крикнул дядя Вернон.\n\nТетя Петуния в ужасе ахнула.\n\n- А, вы оба, варите свои головы, - сказал Хагрид. «Гарри - ты волшебник».\n\nВ хижине наступила тишина. Было слышно только море и свист ветра.\n\n«Я что»? ахнул Гарри.\n\n- Конечно, волшебник, - сказал Хагрид, снова садясь на диван, который застонал и опустился еще ниже, - и я бы сказал, что если вы немного подучите, . С такой мамой и папой, как ваши, кем бы вы еще были? «Думаю, тебе пора читать письмо».\n\nГарри протянул руку, наконец, чтобы взять желтоватый конверт с изумрудно-зеленым адресом мистеру Х Поттеру, Пол, Хижина на Скале, Море. Он вытащил письмо и прочитал:\n\nХОГВАРТСКАЯ ШКОЛА ЧЛОВЕЩИН и ВОЛШЕБНИКОВ.\n\nДиректор: АЛЬБУС ДАМБЛДОР.\n\n(Орден Мерлина, Первый класс, Великий Сорк., Главнокомандующий Чернокнижник, Высший Шутник, Международная Конфедерация Волшебников).\n\nДорогой мистер Поттер,\n\nМы рады сообщить вам, что вы были приняты в школу чародейства и волшебства Хогвартс. В приложении вы найдете список всех необходимых книг и оборудования.\n\nСрок начинается 1 сентября. Ждем вашу сову не позднее 31 июля.\n\nС уважением,\n\nМинерва МакГонагалл,\n\nзаместитель директора.\n\nВопросы взорвались в голове Гарри, как фейерверк, и он не мог решить, что задать первым. Через несколько минут он пробормотал: «Что значит, они ждут мою сову»?\n\n«Скачут горгоны, это напомнило мне», - сказал Хагрид, хлопнув ладонью по лбу с достаточной силой, чтобы сбить лошадь с телегой, а из еще одного кармана пальто он вытащил сову - настоящую, живую, довольно взъерошенную сова - длинное перо и свиток пергамента. Зажав языком между зубами, он нацарапал записку, которую Гарри мог прочитать вверх ногами: «\n\nДорогой профессор Дамблдор,\n\nотдай Гарри его письмо».\n\nЗавтра возьму его за вещами.\n\nПогода ужасная. Надеюсь ты в порядке.\n\nХагрид\n\nХагрид свернул записку, отдал ее сове, которая зажала ее клювом, подошел к двери и выбросил сову в шторм. Затем он вернулся и сел, как будто это было нормально, как разговаривать по телефону.\n\nГарри понял, что его рот открыт, и быстро закрыл его.\n\n\"Где был я\"? - сказал Хагрид, но в этот момент дядя Вернон, все еще бледный, но очень сердитый, вышел на свет костра.\n\n«Он не пойдет», - сказал он.\n\nХагрид хмыкнул.\n\n«Я бы хотел, чтобы такой великий маггл, как ты, остановил его», - сказал он.\n\n\"Что\"? - заинтересовался Гарри.\n\n«Маггл, - сказал Хагрид, - это то, что мы называем немагическим народом, подобным им. «Вам не повезло, что вы выросли в семье самых больших маглов, которых я когда-либо видел».\n\n«Мы поклялись, что положим конец этому мусору, - сказал дядя Вернон, - поклялись, что вытеснем его из него! Воистину волшебник »!\n\n\"Вы знали\"? - сказал Гарри. «Вы знали, что я- волшебник»?\n\n«Знал»! - внезапно вскрикнула тетя Петуния. «Знал! Конечно знали! Как ты могла не быть, если моя убитая сестра была тем, кем была? О, она получила такое же письмо и исчезла в той - той школе - и каждые каникулы приходила домой с карманами, полными лягушачьего икры, превращая чашки в крыс. Я был единственным, кто видел ее такой, какая она была - уродой! Но что касается моих мамы и отца, о нет, это были Лили и Лили, они гордились тем, что в семье есть ведьма »!\n\nОна остановилась, чтобы сделать глубокий вдох, а затем продолжила разглагольствовать. Похоже, она годами хотела сказать все это.\n\n«Потом она встретила этого Поттера в школе, и они ушли, поженились и родили тебя, и, конечно, я знал, что ты будешь такой же, такой же странный, такой же- как- ненормальный, - а потом, пожалуйста, она пошла и взорвалась, и мы с тобой приземлились »!\n\nГарри побледнел. Как только он обрел голос, он сказал: «Взорван? Ты сказал мне, что они погибли в автокатастрофе »!\n\n«АВАРИЯ АВТОМОБИЛЯ»! - проревел Хагрид, вскакивая так сердито, что Дурсли побежали обратно в свой угол. «Как автокатастрофа могла убить Лили и Джеймса Поттеров? Возмущение! Скандал! Гарри Поттер не знает своей истории, хотя каждый ребенок в нашем мире знает его имя »!\n\n\"Но почему? Что случилось\"? - настойчиво спросил Гарри.\n\nГнев улетучился с лица Хагрида. Он выглядел внезапно встревоженным.\n\n«Я никогда не ожидал этого», - сказал он низким обеспокоенным голосом. «Я понятия не имел, когда Дамблдор сказал мне, что могут возникнуть проблемы с получением тебя, сколько ты не знал. Ах, Гарри, я не знаю, тот ли я человек, чтобы сказать тебе, но кто-то должен - ты не можешь уйти из Хогвартса, не зная ».\n\nОн бросил на Дурслей недобрый взгляд.\n\n«Что ж, лучше тебе знать столько, сколько я могу тебе сказать, - помни, я не могу тебе всего рассказать, это великая мистерия, части ее; ».\n\nОн сел, несколько секунд смотрел в огонь, а затем сказал: «Это начинается, я полагаю, с- с человека, которого зовут, но это невероятно, что вы не знаете его имени, все в нашем мире знают-»\n\n« ВОЗ\"?\n\n- Ну- я не люблю произносить имя, если могу. Никто не делает\".\n\n\"Почему бы и нет\"?\n\n«Глотая горгулий, Гарри, люди все еще напуганы. Черт возьми, это сложно. Видите, там был волшебник, который пошел; Плохо. Так плохо, как ты мог пойти. Хуже. Хуже, чем хуже. Его звали . . ».\n\nХагрид сглотнул, но не произнес ни слова.\n\n«Не могли бы вы это записать»? - предложил Гарри.\n\n«Не-а, не могу это написать по буквам. Хорошо - Волдеморт ». Хагрид вздрогнул. «Не заставляй меня повторять это снова. В общем, этот- этот волшебник, лет двадцать назад, начал искать последователей. У них тоже есть - некоторые боялись, некоторые просто хотели немного его силы, потому что он получал силу, хорошо. Мрачные дни, Гарри. Не знал, кому доверять, не осмеливался подружиться со странными волшебниками или ведьмами; случились ужасные вещи. Он забирал. Конечно, некоторые противостояли ему - и он их убивал. Ужасно. Единственным оставшимся безопасным местом был Хогвартс. Считай, что Дамблдор единственный, кого боялся Сами-Знаете-Кто. Во всяком случае, тогда я не осмелился взять школу.\n\n«Итак, ваши мама и папа были такими хорошими ведьмами и волшебниками, как я когда-либо знал. Старший мальчик и девочка в Хогвартсе в свое время! Предположим, мистерия заключается в том, почему Сами-Знаете-Кто никогда раньше не пытался переманить их на свою сторону; вероятно, знал, что они были слишком близки, чтобы Дамблдор не хотел иметь ничего общего с Темной стороной.\n\n«Может, он думал, что сможет их убедить; возможно, он просто хотел, чтобы они не мешали. Все знают, что он появился в деревне, где вы все жили, на Хэллоуин десять лет назад. Тебе был всего год. Он приехал в ваш дом и - и -\n\nХагрид внезапно вытащил очень грязный, покрытый пятнами носовой платок и высморкался со звуком, похожим на гудок.\n\n«Извини», - сказал он. «Но это так грустно - знал своих маму и папу, и более хороших людей вы не могли найти - в любом случае; .\n\n- Сами-Знаете-Кто их убил. А потом - а это настоящая загадка - он тоже пытался убить тебя. Я полагаю, хотел, чтобы он поработал с этим чисто, а может, к тому времени он просто любил убивать. Но он не мог этого сделать. Никогда не задумывался, откуда у тебя такая отметина на лбу? Это был необычный разрез. Это то, что ты получаешь, когда тебя коснется могущественное злое проклятие - позаботился о твоей маме, папе и даже твоем доме, - но на тебя это не подействовало, и именно поэтому ты знаменит, Гарри. Никто и никогда не выжил после того, как он решил убить их, никто, кроме тебя, и он убил нескольких из лучших ведьм и волшебников своего времени - Маккиннонов, Кости, Прюеттов - и ты был всего лишь младенец, и «ты жил».\n\nЧто-то очень болезненное происходило в голове Гарри. Когда рассказ Хагрида подошел к концу, он снова увидел ослепляющую вспышку зеленого света, более отчетливо, чем когда-либо раньше, - и он вспомнил кое-что еще, впервые в своей жизни: высокий, холодный, жестокий смех.\n\nХагрид с грустью наблюдал за ним.\n\n- Сам забрал тебя из разрушенного дома по приказу Дамблдора. Я принес тебе эту партию. . ».\n\n«Куча старого мусора», - сказал дядя Вернон. Гарри подпрыгнул; он почти забыл, что там были Дурсли. Дядя Вернон определенно вернул себе храбрость. Он смотрел на Хагрида, сжав кулаки.\n\n«А теперь послушай, мальчик, - прорычал он, - я согласен, что в тебе есть что-то странное, наверное, ничто хорошее избиение не могло бы вылечить», а что касается всего этого о твоих родителях, ну, они были чудаками, не отрицая это, и, на мой взгляд, мир станет лучше без них - просили всего, что у них есть, смешиваясь с этими волшебными типами - именно то, что я ожидал, всегда знал, что они придут к неприятному концу -\n\nНо в этот момент Хагрид спрыгнул с дивана и вытащил потрепанный розовый зонтик из-под пальто. Направив это на дядю Вернона, как на меч, он сказал: «Я предупреждаю вас, Дурсль, я предупреждаю вас, еще одно слово. . ».\n\nВ опасности быть пронзенным бородатым гигантом концом зонтика, храбрость дяди Вернона снова исчезла; он прижался к стене и замолчал.\n\n«Так лучше», - сказал Хагрид, тяжело дыша и снова садясь на диван, который на этот раз осел прямо на пол.\n\nМежду тем у Гарри все еще оставались вопросы, сотни из них.\n\n«Но что случилось с Вол- извините- я имею в виду, Сами-Знаете-Кого»?\n\n«Хороший вопрос, Гарри. Исчезнувший. Исчез. В ту же ночь он пытался тебя убить. Делает тебя еще более известным. Это самая большая мистерия, понимаете; он становился все сильнее и сильнее - почему он ушел?\n\n«Некоторые говорят, что он умер. По-моему, бред. Не знаю, осталось ли в нем достаточно людей, чтобы умереть. Некоторые говорят, что он все еще там, хочет сказать свое время, но я в это не верю. Люди, которые были на его стороне, вернулись на нашу сторону. Некоторые из них вышли из своего рода транса. Не думай, что они могли бы это сделать, если бы он вернулся.\n\n«Большинство из нас считает, что он все еще где-то там, но потерял свои силы. Слишком слаб, чтобы продолжать. Потому что что-то в тебе прикончило его, Гарри. В ту ночь было что-то, на что он не рассчитывал - я не знаю, что это было, никто не делает - но что-то в тебе поставило его в тупик, хорошо ».\n\nХагрид посмотрел на Гарри с теплотой и уважением, горящими в его глазах, но Гарри, вместо того чтобы чувствовать себя довольным и гордым, был совершенно уверен, что произошла ужасная ошибка. Волшебник? Ему? Как он мог быть? Дадли всю свою жизнь запугивал его тётя Петуния и дядя Вернон; если он действительно был волшебником, почему они не превращались в бородавчатых жаб каждый раз, когда они пытались запереть его в шкафу? Если он когда-то победил величайшего колдуна в мире, почему Дадли всегда мог пинать его, как футбольный мяч?\n\n- Хагрид, - тихо сказал он, - я думаю, ты, должно быть, ошибся. Не думаю, что могу быть волшебником ».\n\nК его удивлению, Хагрид усмехнулся.\n\n«Не волшебник, а? Никогда ничего не происходило, когда ты был напуган или зол »?\n\nГарри посмотрел в огонь. Теперь он подумал об этом; все странные вещи, которые когда-либо приводили в ярость его тетю и дядю, происходили, когда он, Гарри, был расстроен или зол; преследуемый бандой Дадли, он каким-то образом оказался вне их досягаемости; боясь пойти в школу с этой нелепой стрижкой, ему удалось отрастить ее снова; и в самый последний раз, когда Дадли ударил его, разве он не отомстил, даже не осознавая, что делает это? Разве он не натравил на него удав?\n\nГарри снова посмотрел на Хагрида, улыбаясь, и увидел, что Хагрид прямо ему сияет.\n\n\"Видеть\"? - сказал Хагрид. «Гарри Поттер, а не волшебник - погоди, ты будешь знаменит в Хогвартсе».\n\nНо дядя Вернон не собирался сдаваться без боя.\n\n«Разве я не говорил тебе, что он не поедет»? - прошипел он. «Он собирается учиться в Стоунволл Хай, и он будет за это благодарен. Я прочитал эти письма, и ему нужна всякая ерунда - книги заклинаний, палочки и- -\n\nЕсли он хочет, чтобы он ушел, такой великий маггл, как ты, не остановит его, - прорычал Хагрид. «Остановите Лили и сына Джеймса Поттера поехать в Хогвартс! Ты злишься. Его имя не разглашается с тех пор, как он родился. Он из лучшей школы колдовства и волшебства в мире. Семь лет там, и он не узнает себя. Он будет со своими детьми, для разнообразия, и «он будет под руководством величайшего директора Хогвартса, которого когда-либо видел Альбус Дамблд\n\n»- - завопил дядя Вернон.\n\nНо в конце концов он зашел слишком далеко. Хагрид схватил свой зонтик и закружил им над головой. «НИКОГДА, - прогремел он, - - НАПИШИТЕСЬ - АЛЬБУСА - ДАМБЛДОР - В - ПЕРЕД - ОТ - МЕНЯ»!\n\nОн поднял зонт, свистнув в воздухе, и указал на Дадли - там вспыхнула фиолетовая вспышка, звук, похожий на фейерверк, резкий визг, и в следующую секунду Дадли танцевал прямо на месте, сложив руки на своем толстом теле снизу, воющий от боли. Когда он повернулся к ним спиной, Гарри увидел курчавый свиный хвост, торчащий из дыры в его брюках.\n\n- взревел дядя Вернон. Утащив тетю Петунью и Дадли в другую комнату, он бросил последний испуганный взгляд на Хагрида и захлопнул за ними дверь.\n\nХагрид посмотрел на свой зонтик и погладил бороду.\n\n«Не следовало выходить из себя, - сказал он с сожалением, - но это все равно не сработало. Речь идет о том, чтобы превратить его в свинью, но я полагаю, что он все равно был так похож на свинью, что от него почти ничего не оставалось ».\n\nОн искоса взглянул на Гарри из-под густых бровей.\n\n«Будем признательны, если вы не упомянули об этом ником в Хогвартсе», - сказал он. - Я- э-э- не должен заниматься магией, строго говоря. Мне разрешили немного следить за вами и получать письма к вам и тому подобное - одна из причин, по которой я так хотел взяться за эту работу-\n\n- Почему ты не должен заниматься магией? - спросил Гарри.\n\n- О, ну- я сам был в Хогвартсе, но меня- э-э- исключили, если честно. У меня третий год. Они сломали мне палочку пополам. Но Дамблдор позволил мне остаться егерем. Великий человек, Дамблдор ».\n\n«За что вас исключили»?\n\n«Уже поздно, а завтра у нас много дел», - громко сказал Хагрид. «Надо подняться в город, достать все свои книги и все это».\n\nОн снял свое плотное черное пальто и бросил его Гарри.\n\n«Под этим можно прыгнуть», - сказал он. «Не возражайте, если он немного покачивается, я думаю, у меня все еще есть пара сони в одном из карманов».\n\nНа следующее утро Гарри проснулся рано. Хотя он мог сказать, что был дневной свет, он держал глаза закрытыми.\n\n«Это был сон», - твердо сказал он себе. «Мне приснилось, что гигант по имени Хагрид пришел сказать мне, что я иду в школу волшебников. Когда я открою глаза, я буду дома, в шкафу ».\n\nВнезапно раздался громкий звук постукивания.\n\n«А тетя Петуния стучится в дверь», - подумал Гарри с замиранием сердца. Но он все еще не открывал глаза. Это был такой хороший сон.\n\nTap Tap Tap\n\n«Хорошо, - пробормотал Гарри, - я встаю».\n\nОн сел, и тяжелое пальто Хагрида упало с него. Хижина была залита солнечным светом, буря закончилась, сам Хагрид спал на обрушившемся диване, а сова стучала когтем по окну с газетой в клюве.\n\nГарри с трудом поднялся на ноги, так счастлив, что ему казалось, что внутри него надувается большой воздушный шар. Он подошел прямо к окну и распахнул его. Подлетела сова и уронила газету на Хагрида, который не проснулся. Затем сова упала на пол и начала атаковать пальто Хагрида.\n\n«Не делай этого».\n\nГарри попытался отвести сову с дороги, но она яростно щелкнула клювом и продолжила терзать пальто.\n\n«Хагрид»! - громко сказал Гарри. - Вот сова- -\n\nЗаплати ему, - проворчал Хагрид в диван.\n\n\"Какая\"?\n\n«Он хочет заплатить за доставку газеты. Загляни в карманы ».\n\nПальто Хагрида, казалось, состояло только из карманов: связки ключей, пули, клубки веревки, мятные мяты, чайные пакетики; наконец, Гарри вытащил пригоршню странно выглядящих монет.\n\n- Дайте ему пять кнутов, - сонно сказал Хагрид.\n\n«Кнутс»?\n\n«Маленькие бронзовые».\n\nГарри отсчитал пять маленьких бронзовых монет, и сова протянула ему ногу, чтобы Гарри мог положить деньги в привязанный к ней небольшой кожаный мешочек. Затем он улетел через открытое окно.\n\nХагрид громко зевнул, сел и потянулся.\n\n«Лучше уходи, Гарри, сегодня много надо делать, надо вставать в Лондон и покупать все, что тебе нужно для школы».\n\nГарри переворачивал волшебные монеты и смотрел на них. Он только что подумал о чем-то, что заставило его почувствовать себя так, как будто счастливый шар внутри него прокололся.\n\n«Гм- Хагрид»?\n\n«Мм»? - сказал Хагрид, натягивая свои огромные сапоги.\n\n- У меня нет денег - а вчера вечером вы слышали дядю Вернона; он не будет платить за то, чтобы я пошел изучать магию ».\n\n«Не беспокойся об этом», - сказал Хагрид, вставая и почесывая затылок. «Как думаешь, твои родители ничего тебе не оставили»?\n\n«Но если их дом будет разрушен »\n\n«Они не хранили свое золото в доме, мальчик! Нет, первая остановка для нас - Гринготтс. Банк волшебников. Ешьте колбасу, они неплохо простужаются - и я бы тоже ни капельки не отказался от именинного торта ».\n\n«У волшебников есть банки»?\n\n«Только один. Гринготтс. Бегут гоблины ».\n\nГарри уронил кусок сосиски, который держал в руке.\n\n«Гоблины»?\n\n- Ага- так что вы будете безумны, если попытаетесь ограбить его, я вам это скажу. Никогда не связывайся с гоблинами, Гарри. Гринготтс - самое безопасное место в мире для всего, что вы хотите сохранить в безопасности, кроме, может быть, Хогвартса. Собственно говоря, я все равно должен посетить Гринготтс. Фер Дамблдор. Дело Хогвартса ». Хагрид гордо выпрямился. «Он обычно заставляет меня делать для него важные дела. Приносит вещи из Гринготтса - знает, что может мне доверять, понимаете.\n\n«Есть все? Тогда пошли\".\n\nГарри последовал за Хагридом на скалу. Теперь небо было совершенно чистым, и море блестело в солнечном свете. Лодка, которую нанял дядя Вернон, все еще была там, на дне после шторма было много воды.\n\n\"Как ты сюда попал\"? - спросил Гарри, ища другую лодку.\n\n«Летал», - сказал Хагрид.\n\n«Пролетели»?\n\n«Да, но мы вернемся к этому. Теперь я не собираюсь использовать магию ».\n\nОни устроились в лодке, Гарри все еще смотрел на Хагрида, пытаясь представить его летящим.\n\n- Хотя, похоже, стыдно, - сказал Хагрид, бросив на Гарри еще один искоса взгляд. «Если бы я был тер- э-э- ускорил процесс, не могли бы вы не упомянуть об этом в Хогвартсе»?\n\n«Конечно, нет», - сказал Гарри, желая увидеть больше магии. Хагрид снова вытащил розовый зонтик, дважды постучал им о борт лодки, и они помчались к берегу.\n\n«Почему ты злишься, пытаясь ограбить Гринготтс»? - спросил Гарри.\n\n«Заклинания- чары», - сказал Хагрид, разворачивая газету. «Они говорят, что драконы охраняют хранилища повышенной безопасности. А потом тебе нужно найти дорогу - Гринготтс в сотнях миль от Лондона, понимаете. Глубоко под землей. Вы бы умерли с голоду, пытаясь выбраться отсюда, даже если бы вам удалось заполучить свои руки ».\n\nГарри сидел и думал об этом, пока Хагрид читал свою газету «Ежедневный пророк». Гарри узнал от дяди Вернона, что людям нравится, когда они это делают, но это было очень сложно, у него никогда в жизни не было так много вопросов.\n\n- Министерство магии, как обычно, лажает, - пробормотал Хагрид, переворачивая страницу.\n\n«Есть Министерство Магии»? - спросил Гарри, прежде чем он смог остановиться.\n\n«Конечно, - сказал Хагрид. - Конечно, они хотели, чтобы Дамблдор был министром, но он никогда не уедет из Хогвартса, поэтому старый Корнелиус Фадж получил эту работу. Работник, если вообще был. Поэтому он каждое утро забрасывает Дамблдора совами, спрашивая совета ».\n\n«Но что делает Министерство магии»?\n\n«Ну, их главная задача - скрыть от маглов, что в стране все еще есть ведьмы и волшебники».\n\n\"Почему\"?\n\n\"Почему? Черт побери, Гарри, всем нужны волшебные решения своих проблем. Нет, нам лучше остаться в покое ».\n\nВ этот момент лодка мягко ударилась о стену гавани. Хагрид свернул газету, и они поднялись по каменным ступеням на улицу.\n\nПрохожие много смотрели на Хагрида, пока они шли через маленький городок к вокзалу. Гарри не мог их винить. Мало того, что Хагрид был вдвое выше всех остальных, он продолжал указывать на совершенно обычные вещи, такие как парковочные счетчики, и громко говорил: «Видишь это, Гарри? То, что выдумывают эти маглы, а?\n\n«Хагрид», - сказал Гарри, немного задыхаясь, бегая, чтобы не отставать, - «ты сказал, что в Гринготтсе есть драконы»?\n\n«Ну, как они говорят, - сказал Хагрид. «Крики, я бы хотел дракона».\n\n«Вы хотите один»?\n\n«Хотел один с детства - поехали».\n\nОни добрались до станции. Через пять минут был поезд до Лондона. Хагрид, который не понимал «маггловских денег», как он это называл, отдал счета Гарри, чтобы тот мог купить их билеты.\n\nЛюди смотрели в поезде больше, чем когда-либо. Хагрид занял два места и сел вязать нечто, напоминающее канареечно-желтую цирковую палатку.\n\n«Письмо все еще есть, Гарри»? - спросил он, считая швы. Гарри достал из кармана пергаментный конверт.\n\n«Хорошо, - сказал Хагрид. «Там есть список всего, что вам нужно».\n\nГарри развернул второй листок бумаги, который не заметил накануне вечером, и прочитал:\n\nХОГВАРТСКАЯ ШКОЛА ЧЛОВОДСТВА И ВОЛШЕБНИКА.\n\nУНИФОРМА.\n\nСтудентам первого курса потребуется:\n\n1: Три комплекта простой рабочей одежды (черного цвета).\n\n2: Одна однотонная остроконечная шляпа (черная) для повседневного ношения.\n\n3: Одна пара защитных перчаток (шкура дракона или аналогичный).\n\n4: Один зимний плащ (черный, застежки серебряные).\n\nОбратите внимание, что на всей одежде учеников должны быть бирки с именами.\nКУРСОВЫЕ КНИГИ.\n\nВсе учащиеся должны иметь по одному экземпляру каждого из следующих материалов:\n\nСтандартная книга заклинаний (1 класс) Миранды Тетеревятник.\n\nИстория магии Батильды Бэгшот.\n\nМагическая теория Адальберта Ваффлинга.\n\nРуководство для начинающих по трансфигурации с помощью рвотного переключателя.\n\nТысяча волшебных трав и грибов от Phyllida Spore.\n\nМагические зелья и зелья Арсения Джиггера.\n\nФантастические твари и где они обитают Ньют Скамандер.\n\nТемные силы: Руководство по самозащите Квентина Тримбла.\n\nДРУГОЕ ОБОРУДОВАНИЕ:\n\n1 палочка.\n\n1 набор котлов (оловянный, стандартный размер 2)\n\n1 набор стеклянных или хрустальных пузырьков\n\n1 набор телескопов\n\n1 латунные весы.\n\nСтуденты также могут принести сову ИЛИ кошку ИЛИ жабу.\n\nНАПОМИНАЕМ РОДИТЕЛЯМ, ЧТО ПЕРВЫЕ ГОДЫ НЕ РАЗРЕШАЮТСЯ ИХ СОБСТВЕННЫЕ БРОМСТИКЫ.\n\n«Можно ли все это купить в Лондоне»? - вслух задумался Гарри.\n\n«Если вы знаете, куда идти, - сказал Хагрид.\n\nГарри никогда раньше не был в Лондоне. Хотя Хагрид, казалось, знал, куда идет, он явно не привык добираться туда обычным способом. Он застрял в турникете в метро и громко жаловался, что сидений слишком мало, а поезда слишком медленные.\n\n«Я не знаю, как маглы обходятся без магии», - сказал он, когда они поднимались по сломанному эскалатору, ведущему на оживленную дорогу, полную магазинов.\n\nХагрид был таким огромным, что легко разделил толпу; Гарри оставалось только держаться за ним. Они проезжали книжные и музыкальные магазины, рестораны, где подают гамбургеры, и кинотеатры, но нигде не было похоже, что здесь можно продать волшебную палочку. Это была обычная улица, полная обычных людей. Неужели под ними действительно лежат груды волшебного золота? Были ли действительно магазины, в которых продавались книги заклинаний и метлы? Разве это не какая-то шутка, которую придумали Дурсли? Если бы Гарри не знал, что у Дурслей нет чувства юмора, он бы так и подумал; но каким-то образом, несмотря на то, что все, что Хагрид сказал ему до сих пор, было невероятным, Гарри не мог не доверять ему.\n\n- Вот он, - сказал Хагрид, останавливаясь, - Дырявый Котел. Это известное место ».\n\nЭто был крошечный грязный паб. Если бы Хагрид не указал на это, Гарри бы не заметил, что это было там. Проходящие мимо люди даже не взглянули на него. Их глаза скользили от большого книжного магазина с одной стороны к музыкальному магазину с другой, как будто они вообще не могли видеть Дырявый Котел. На самом деле, у Гарри было очень странное чувство, что только он и Хагрид могли это видеть. Прежде чем он успел упомянуть об этом, Хагрид ввел его внутрь.\n\nДля известного места было очень темно и убого. Несколько старушек сидели в углу и пили крошечные рюмки шерри. Один из них курил длинную трубку. Маленький человечек в цилиндре разговаривал со старым барменом, который был совершенно лысым и выглядел как беззубый грецкий орех. Когда они вошли, тихая болтовня прекратилась. Казалось, все знают Хагрида; они помахали ему и улыбнулись, и бармен потянулся за стаканом, говоря: «Как обычно, Хагрид»?\n\n«Не могу, Том, я по делам Хогвартса», - сказал Хагрид, хлопнув Гарри по плечу своей огромной рукой и заставив его колени подогнуться.\n\n- Господи, - сказал бармен, глядя на Гарри, - это- это может быть-?\n\nДырявый котел внезапно стал совершенно неподвижным и тихим.\n\n«Благослови мою душу, - прошептал старый бармен, - Гарри Поттер; какая честь ».\n\nОн выскочил из-за стойки бара, бросился к Гарри и схватил его за руку со слезами на глазах.\n\n«С возвращением, мистер Поттер, с возвращением».\n\nГарри не знал, что сказать. Все смотрели на него. Старуха с трубкой попыхивала трубкой, даже не подозревая, что она погасла. Хагрид сиял.\n\nЗатем раздался громкий скрип стульев, и в следующий момент Гарри обнаружил, что пожимает руки всем в Дырявом Котле.\n\n«Дорис Крокфорд, мистер Поттер, не могу поверить, что я наконец встречаю вас».\n\n«Так горжусь, мистер Поттер, я так горжусь».\n\n«Всегда хотел пожать тебе руку - я весь трепещу».\n\n«В восторге, мистер Поттер, просто не могу сказать вам, как зовут Диггла, Дедалус Диггл».\n\n«Я видел тебя раньше»! - сказал Гарри, когда цилиндр Дедала Диггла упал от волнения. «Ты однажды поклонился мне в магазине».\n\n\"Он помнит\"! - воскликнул Дедал Диггл, оглядываясь на всех. \"Ты это слышал? Он меня помнит »! Гарри снова и снова пожимал руки - Дорис Крокфорд возвращалась снова и снова.\n\nБледный молодой человек очень нервно шагал вперед. Один его глаз подергивался.\n\n«Профессор Квиррелл»! - сказал Хагрид. «Гарри, профессор Квиррелл будет одним из ваших учителей в Хогвартсе».\n\n- ПП-Поттер, - запинаясь, пробормотал профессор Квиррелл, хватая Гарри за руку, - я не могу сказать тебе, как я рад встрече с тобой.\n\n«Какой магии вы учите, профессор Квиррелл»?\n\n«D-защита от DD-темных искусств», - пробормотал профессор Квиррелл, как будто он предпочел бы не думать об этом. «Н-не то, чтобы оно тебе не нужно, а, ПП-Поттер»? Он нервно засмеялся. - Полагаю, вы получите все свое оборудование? Мне нужно взять новую тетрадку о вампирах, я сам ». Он выглядел напуганным самой этой мыслью.\n\nНо другие не позволили профессору Квирреллу держать Гарри при себе. Чтобы уйти от них всех, потребовалось почти десять минут. Наконец Хагриду удалось заглушить болтовню.\n\n«Надо продолжать - много покупать. Давай, Гарри ».\n\nДорис Крокфорд в последний раз пожала Гарри руку, и Хагрид провел их через бар в небольшой обнесенный стеной двор, где не было ничего, кроме мусорного бака и нескольких сорняков.\n\nХагрид ухмыльнулся Гарри.\n\n«Сказал да, не так ли? Сказал, что ты знаменит. Даже профессор Квиррелл боялся познакомиться с вами - заметьте, обычно он дрожит ».\n\n«Он всегда так нервничает»?\n\n\"О, да. Бедный парень. Блестящий ум. Он был в порядке, пока изучал книги, но затем он взял годовой перерыв, чтобы получить какой-нибудь личный опыт; . Говорят, он встретил вампиров в Шварцвальде, и с ведьмой было немного неприятностей - с тех пор никогда не было прежним. Боясь студентов, боюсь своего предмета - а где же мне зонтик?\n\nВампиры? Ведьмы? Голова Гарри кружилась. Тем временем Хагрид считал кирпичи в стене над мусорным баком.\n\n«Три вверх; двое поперек, - пробормотал он. «Хорошо, отойди, Гарри».\n\nОн трижды постучал по стене острием зонтика.\n\nКирпич, которого он коснулся, задрожал - он изогнулся - посередине образовалась небольшая дыра - она ​​становилась все шире и шире - через секунду они оказались перед аркой, достаточно большой даже для Хагрида, аркой на мощеную улицу, которая извивалась и сворачивалась  зрения.\n\n«Добро пожаловать, - сказал Хагрид, - в Косой переулок».\n\nОн ухмыльнулся изумлению Гарри. Они прошли через арку. Гарри быстро оглянулся через плечо и увидел, что арка мгновенно превратилась в сплошную стену.\n\nСолнце ярко освещало кипу котлов возле ближайшего магазина. «Котлы - всех размеров - медные, латунные, оловянные, серебряные - самовмешивающиеся - складные», - гласила табличка, висящая над ними.\n\n«Да, он тебе понадобится, - сказал Хагрид, - но сначала мы должны получить твои деньги».\n\nГарри пожалел, что у него было еще восемь глаз. Он поворачивал голову во все стороны, пока они шли по улице, пытаясь осмотреть все сразу: магазины, вещи снаружи, людей, делающих покупки. Полная женщина возле аптекаря покачала головой, когда они проходили, говоря: «Драконья печень, семнадцать серпов за унцию, они безумны; ».\n\nНизкое тихое улюлюканье доносилось из темного магазина с вывеской «Eeylops Owl Emporium - Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown и Snowy. Несколько мальчиков примерно возраста Гарри прижались носами к окну с метлами в нем. «Послушайте, - услышал Гарри один из них, - новый« Нимбус Две тысячи »- самый быстрый из когда-либо-» Были магазины, торгующие мантии, магазины, торгующие телескопами и странными серебряными инструментами, которых Гарри никогда раньше не видел, окна были завалены бочками с селезенками летучих мышей и угрями «глаза, шатающиеся груды книг заклинаний, перья и свитки пергамента, бутылки с зельями, шары луны; .\n\n«Гринготтс», - сказал Хагрид.\n\nОни подошли к белоснежному зданию, которое возвышалось над другими магазинчиками. Возле его полированных бронзовых дверей в алой и золотой униформе стоял-\n\n«Да, это гоблин», - тихо сказал Хагрид, когда они поднимались к нему по белокаменным ступеням. Гоблин был примерно на голову ниже Гарри. У него было смуглое умное лицо, остроконечная борода и, как заметил Гарри, очень длинные пальцы и ступни. Он поклонился, когда они вошли внутрь. Теперь перед ними стояла вторая пара дверей, на этот раз серебряных, с выгравированными на них словами:\n\nВойдите, незнакомец, но берегитесь того, что ожидает грех жадности, Для тех, кто берет, но не зарабатывает, Должен дорого заплатить их очередь.\nТак что если ты ищешь под нашими этажами Сокровище, которое никогда не было твоим, Вор, тебя предупредили, остерегайся найти там больше, чем сокровище.\n«Как я уже сказал, да будет безумно попытаться ограбить его», - сказал Хагрид.\n\nПара гоблинов поклонилась им через серебряные двери, и они оказались в огромном мраморном зале. Еще около сотни гоблинов сидели на высоких стульях за длинным прилавком, строчили в больших бухгалтерских книгах, взвешивали монеты на медных весах, рассматривали драгоценные камни через очки. Было слишком много дверей, чтобы сосчитать, что они вели из зала, и еще больше гоблинов показывали людям вход и выход. Хагрид и Гарри направились к стойке.\n\n«Доброе утро», - сказал Хагрид свободному гоблину. «Мы пришли забрать немного денег из сейфа мистера Гарри Поттера».\n\n«У вас есть его ключ, сэр»?\n\n- Он где-то здесь, - сказал Хагрид и начал высовывать карманы на прилавок, разбрасывая горсть заплесневелых собачьих печений по книге чисел гоблина. Гоблин наморщил нос. Гарри смотрел, как гоблин справа взвешивает груду рубинов величиной с раскаленные угли.\n\n- Понял, - наконец сказал Хагрид, показывая крошечный золотой ключик.\n\nГоблин внимательно посмотрел на него.\n\n«Вроде в порядке».\n\n«И еще вот письмо от профессора Дамблдора», - важно сказал Хагрид, выпячивая грудь. «Речь идет о Сам-Знаете-Что в хранилище семьсот тринадцать».\n\nГоблин внимательно прочитал письмо.\n\n- Хорошо, - сказал он, возвращая его Хагриду, - я попрошу кого-нибудь провести вас в оба хранилища. Griphook »!\n\nГрипхук был еще одним гоблином. После того, как Хагрид запихнул все собачьи бисквиты обратно в карманы, они с Гарри последовали за Крюкохвостом к одной из дверей, ведущих из холла.\n\n«Что за сам-знаешь-что в хранилище семьсот тринадцать»? - спросил Гарри.\n\n- Не могу этого сказать, - загадочно сказал Хагрид. «Очень секретно. Дело Хогвартса. Дамблдор мне доверял. Больше того, чем моя работа, стоит сказать тебе ».\n\nГрипхук придержал для них дверь. Гарри, ожидавший большего количества мрамора, был удивлен. Они оказались в узком каменном проходе, освещенном пылающими факелами. Он круто спускался вниз, и на полу были небольшие железнодорожные пути. Грипхук свистнул, и к ним по рельсам мчалась небольшая тележка. Они забрались внутрь - Хагрид с трудом - и поехали.\n\nСначала они просто мчались по лабиринту извилистых коридоров. Гарри попытался вспомнить, левую, правую, правую, левую, среднюю вилку, правую, левую, но это было невозможно. Грохочущая тележка, казалось, знала свой путь, потому что Грипхук не управлял.\n\nГлаза Гарри защипало, когда холодный воздух пронесся мимо них, но он держал их широко открытыми. Однажды ему показалось, что он увидел вспышку огня в конце коридора, и он обернулся, чтобы увидеть, не дракон ли это, но было слишком поздно - они погрузились еще глубже, миновав подземное озеро, где огромные сталактиты и сталагмиты росли из потолка и этаж.\n\n«Никогда не знаю, - крикнул Гарри Хагриду сквозь шум тележки, - в чем разница между сталагмитом и сталактитом»?\n\n«В сталагмите есть буква« м », - сказал Хагрид. «И не задавай мне вопросов сейчас, я думаю, я заболею».\n\nОн действительно выглядел очень зеленым, и когда тележка наконец остановилась у маленькой двери в стене коридора, Хагрид вылез из машины и был вынужден прислониться к стене, чтобы у него не дрожали колени.\n\nКрюк отпер дверь. Из него вышло много зеленого дыма, и когда он рассеялся, Гарри ахнул. Внутри лежали груды золотых монет. Колонны из серебра. Куча маленьких бронзовых кнатов.\n\n«Все твои», - улыбнулся Хагрид.\n\nВсе Гарри - это было невероятно. Дурсли не могли знать об этом, иначе они бы получили это от него быстрее, чем моргание. Как часто они жаловались, сколько Гарри стоит им содержать? И все это время ему принадлежало небольшое состояние, похороненное глубоко под Лондоном.\n\nХагрид помог Гарри сложить немного в сумку.\n\n«Золотые - это галеоны», - пояснил он. «Семнадцать серебряных серпов на галеон и двадцать девять кнутов на серп, это достаточно просто. Хорошо, этого должно хватить на пару сроков, остальное мы сохраним для тебя ». Он повернулся к Крюкохвату. «Убежище семьсот тринадцать, пожалуйста, а мы можем идти помедленнее»?\n\n«Только одна скорость», - сказал Грипхук.\n\nТеперь они шли еще глубже и набирали скорость. Когда они проносились по крутым углам, воздух становился все холоднее и холоднее. Они с грохотом перевалили через подземный овраг, и Гарри перегнулся через край, чтобы попытаться увидеть, что было внизу, на темном дне, но Хагрид застонал и потянул его назад за шиворот.\n\nВ Убежище семьсот тринадцать не было замочной скважины.\n\n«Отойди», - важно сказал Крюкохват. Он нежно погладил дверь одним из своих длинных пальцев, и она просто растаяла.\n\n«Если бы кто-нибудь, кроме гоблина Гринготтса, попробовал это, их бы затянуло через дверь и застряло там», - сказал Грипхук.\n\n«Как часто вы проверяете, есть ли кто внутри»? - спросил Гарри.\n\n«Примерно раз в десять лет», - сказал Грипхук с довольно неприятной ухмылкой.\n\nГарри был уверен, что в этом верхнем хранилище безопасности должно быть что-то действительно экстраординарное, и он нетерпеливо наклонился вперед, ожидая увидеть хотя бы сказочные драгоценности, но сначала он подумал, что оно пусто. Затем он заметил на полу грязный сверток, завернутый в коричневую бумагу. Хагрид поднял его и засунул глубоко под пальто. Гарри очень хотелось узнать, что это было, но он знал, что лучше не спрашивать.\n\n«Давай, возвращайся в эту адскую тележку, и не разговаривай со мной на обратном пути, лучше, если я буду держать рот на замке», - сказал Хагрид.\n\nОднажды дикой поездкой на телеге позже они стояли, моргая на солнце, возле Гринготтса. Гарри не знал, куда бежать первым, теперь, когда у него была полная сумка денег. Ему не нужно было знать, сколько галлеонов на фунт, чтобы знать, что у него было больше денег, чем было за всю свою жизнь - больше денег, чем когда-либо было даже у Дадли.\n\n«Можно также надеть вашу униформу», - сказал Хагрид, кивая на «Одеяния на все случаи жизни» мадам Малкин. - Послушай, Гарри, ты не будешь возражать, если я ускользну, чтобы забрать меня в Дырявом котле? Я ненавижу их повозки Гринготтса ». Он все еще выглядел немного больным, поэтому Гарри вошел в магазин мадам Малкин один, нервничая.\n\nМадам Малкин была приземистой улыбающейся ведьмой, одетой во все лиловые.\n\n«Хогвартс, дорогой»? - сказала она, когда Гарри начал говорить. «Здесь много - еще один молодой человек, которого сейчас обучают».\n\nВ задней части магазина мальчик с бледным острым лицом стоял на скамеечке, а вторая ведьма прикалывала его длинные черные мантии. Мадам Малкин поставила Гарри на табурет рядом с ним, накинула ему на голову длинный халат и начала приколоть его до нужной длины.\n\n«Привет, - сказал мальчик, - тоже Хогвартс»?\n\n«Да», - сказал Гарри.\n\n«Мой отец по соседству покупает мои книги, а мама смотрит на волшебные палочки», - сказал мальчик. У него был скучающий протяжный голос. «Тогда я собираюсь утащить их на гоночные метлы. Я не понимаю, почему у первокурсников не может быть своего. Думаю, я заставлю отца достать мне такой и как-нибудь пронесу его ».\n\nГарри сильно напомнил Дадли.\n\n«У тебя есть собственная метла»? мальчик продолжал.\n\n«Нет», - сказал Гарри.\n\n«Играть вообще в квиддич»?\n\n- Нет, - снова сказал Гарри, гадая, каким может быть квиддич.\n\n«Да- Отец говорит, что это преступление, если меня не выбрали играть для моего дома, и я должен сказать, что согласен. Знаешь, в каком доме ты еще будешь »?\n\n- Нет, - сказал Гарри, с каждой минутой чувствуя себя глупее.\n\n«Ну, никто на самом деле не знает, пока они не доберутся туда, не так ли, но я знаю, что буду в Слизерине, вся наша семья была- представьте, что я в Хаффлпаффе, я думаю, что я уйду, не так ли»?\n\n«Ммм», - сказал Гарри, желая сказать что-нибудь более интересное.\n\n«Я говорю, посмотрите на этого человека»! - внезапно сказал мальчик, кивая в сторону окна. Там стоял Хагрид, ухмыляясь Гарри и указывая на два больших мороженого, чтобы показать, что он не может войти.\n\n«Это Хагрид», - сказал Гарри, довольный тем, что мальчик не знал. «Он работает в Хогвартсе».\n\n«О, - сказал мальчик, - я слышал о нем. Он что-то вроде слуги, не так ли?\n\n«Он егерь, - сказал Гарри. С каждой секундой мальчик все меньше и меньше нравился ему.\n\n\"Да, точно. Я слышал, что он какой-то дикарь - живет в хижине на территории школы и то и дело напивается, пытается творить магию и в конце концов поджигает свою кровать ».\n\n«Я думаю, он великолепен», - холодно сказал Гарри.\n\n\"Вы\"? - сказал мальчик с легкой усмешкой. «Почему он с тобой? Где твои родители\"?\n\n«Они мертвы», - коротко сказал Гарри. Ему не хотелось вдаваться в подробности с этим мальчиком.\n\n«Ой, извините», - сказал другой, совершенно не извиняясь. «Но ведь они же были наши»?\n\n«Они были ведьмами и волшебниками, если вы это имеете в виду».\n\n«Я действительно не думаю, что они должны впускать других, а вы? Они просто не такие, их никогда не учили знать наши пути. Представьте, некоторые из них даже не слышали о Хогвартсе, пока не получили письмо. Я думаю, они должны оставить его в старых волшебных семьях. Какая у вас фамилия?\n\nНо прежде чем Гарри успел ответить, мадам Малкин сказала: «Вот и все, моя дорогая», и Гарри, не извиняясь за предлог прекратить разговаривать с мальчиком, спрыгнул с скамейки для ног.\n\n- Ну, я полагаю, увидимся в Хогвартсе, - сказал протяжный мальчик.\n\nГарри был довольно тихим, когда ел мороженое, купленное ему Хагридом (шоколадно-малиновый с измельченными орехами).\n\n\"Что происходит\"? - сказал Хагрид.\n\n«Ничего», - солгал Гарри. Они остановились, чтобы купить пергамент и перья. Гарри немного повеселел, когда он нашел бутылку с чернилами, которая меняла цвет, когда вы писали. Когда они вышли из магазина, он сказал: «Хагрид, что такое квиддич»?\n\n«Черт возьми, Гарри, я все время забываю, как мало ты знаешь - не знаешь о квиддиче»!\n\n«Не заставляй меня чувствовать себя хуже», - сказал Гарри. Он рассказал Хагриду о мальчишке в доме мадам Малкин.\n\n«- И он сказал, что людей из магловских семей нельзя даже пускать».\n\n«Ты не из магловской семьи. Если бы он знал, кто вы такие - он вырос, зная ваше имя, если его родители из волшебников. Вы видели, какими были все в Дырявом Котле, когда они видели вас. Во всяком случае, что он знает об этом, некоторые из лучших, что я когда-либо видел, были единственными, у кого была магия в длинной череде маглов - посмотрите на свою маму! Посмотри, какая у нее была сестра »!\n\n«Так что же такое квиддич»?\n\n«Это наш спорт. Мастер спорта. Это как футбол в мире маглов - все следят за квиддичем - играют в воздухе на метлах, а там четыре мяча - вроде как сложнее объяснить правила ».\n\n«А что такое Слизерин и Хаффлпафф»?\n\n«Школьные дома. Их четыре. Все говорят, что Хаффлпаффец - много болванов, но\n\n- - Держу пари, я в Хаффлпаффе, - мрачно сказал Гарри.\n\n«Лучше Хаффлпафф, чем Слизерин», - мрачно сказал Хагрид. «Нет ни одной колдуньи или волшебника, которые испортились бы, кроме Слизерина. Сами-Знаете-Кто был одним из них ».\n\n«Вол- извините- Сами-Знаете-Кто был в Хогвартсе»?\n\n«Много лет назад, - сказал Хагрид.\n\nОни купили школьные учебники Гарри в магазине под названием «Флориш энд Блоттс», где полки до потолка были забиты книгами размером с брусчатку в кожаных переплетах; книги размером с почтовые марки в шелковых переплетах; книги, полные необычных символов, и несколько книг, в которых вообще ничего нет. Даже Дадли, который никогда ничего не читал, был бы безумным, если бы заполучил некоторые из них. Хагриду почти пришлось утащить Гарри от «Проклятий и противодействующих проклятий» профессора Виндиктуса Виридиана («Очаровывайте своих друзей и сбивайте с толку врагов последними мщениями: выпадение волос, студенистые ноги, завязывание языка и многое другое»).\n\n«Я пытался узнать, как проклясть Дадли».\n\n«Я не говорю, что это плохая идея, но ты не станешь использовать магию в мире маглов, за исключением особых обстоятельств», - сказал Хагрид. «В любом случае, вы пока не можете сработать ни одно из проклятий, вам нужно гораздо больше изучить, прежде чем вы достигнете этого уровня».\n\nХагрид не позволил Гарри купить котел из цельного золота («В твоем списке написано олово»), но у них есть хорошие весы для взвешивания ингредиентов зелья и складной латунный телескоп. Затем они посетили аптекарь, который был достаточно очаровательным, чтобы компенсировать ужасный запах смеси тухлых яиц и тухлой капусты. На полу стояли бочки со слизью; по стенам стояли банки с травами, сушеными корнями и ярким порошком; С потолка свисали пучки перьев, связки клыков и оскаленных когтей. Пока Хагрид просил у человека за прилавком запас некоторых основных ингредиентов зелья для Гарри, Гарри сам осмотрел серебряные рога единорога на двадцать один галлеон каждый и крохотные блестящие черные глаза жука (пять кнутов за совок).\n\nВозле аптекаря Хагрид снова проверил список Гарри.\n\n«Осталась только твоя палочка - да, и« у меня до сих пор нет подарка на день рождения ».\n\nГарри почувствовал, что краснеет.\n\n«Тебе не нужно-»\n\n«Я знаю, что не должен. Вот что скажи, я достану твое животное. Не жаба, жабы вышли из моды много лет назад, над вами бы посмеялись - а «я не люблю кошек», они заставляют меня чихать. Я принесу тебе сову. Всем детям нужны совы, они бесполезны, носят почту и все ».\n\nДвадцать минут спустя они покинули торговую палату «Eeylops Owl Emporium», которая была темной, полна шороха и мерцания блестящих, как драгоценный камень, глаз. Теперь Гарри нес большую клетку, в которой держалась красивая полярная сова, которая крепко спала, положив голову под свое крыло. Он не мог перестать бормотать свою благодарность, как профессор Квиррелл.\n\n- Не говори об этом, - хрипло сказал Хагрид. - Не ждите, что вы получили от этих Дурслей много подарков. Остался только Олливандер - положи только палочки Олливандера, и тебе нужна лучшая палочка ».\n\nВолшебная палочка; это было то, чего Гарри действительно ждал.\n\nПоследний магазин был узким и убогим. Золотые буквы над дверью читали «Олливандерс: Создатели изящных жезлов с 382 г до нэ». Одна палочка лежала на выцветшей пурпурной подушке в пыльном окне.\n\nКогда они вошли внутрь, где-то в глубине магазина зазвонил колокольчик. Это было крошечное место, пустое, если не считать единственного тонкого стула, на котором Хагрид сел и стал ждать. Гарри чувствовал себя странно, как будто он вошел в очень строгую библиотеку; он проглотил множество новых вопросов, которые только что пришли ему в голову, и вместо этого посмотрел на тысячи узких ящиков, аккуратно сложенных до самого потолка. По какой-то причине у него покалывало затылок. Сама пыль и тишина здесь, казалось, пронизаны какой-то тайной магией.\n\n«Добрый день», - сказал мягкий голос. Гарри подпрыгнул. Хагрид, должно быть, тоже прыгнул, потому что раздался громкий хруст, и он быстро слез с тонкого стула.\n\nПеред ними стоял старик, его широкие бледные глаза сияли, как луны, в сумраке магазина.\n\n- Привет, - неловко сказал Гарри.\n\n«Ах да, - сказал мужчина. «Да, да. Я думал, что скоро увижу тебя. Гарри Поттер\". Это не было вопросом. «У тебя есть глаза твоей матери. Кажется, только вчера она сама была здесь, покупала свою первую палочку. Десять с четвертью дюйма в длину, мягкий, сделанный из ивы. Прекрасная палочка для работы с чарами ».\n\nМистер Олливандер подошел к Гарри. Гарри хотел, чтобы он моргнул. Эти серебристые глаза были немного жуткими.\n\n- А твой отец предпочитал палочку из красного дерева. Одиннадцать дюймов. Податливый. Чуть больше мощности и отлично подходит для преображения. Что ж, я говорю, что твой отец одобрял это - на самом деле, палочка, конечно же, выбирает волшебника ».\n\nМистер Олливандер подошел так близко, что они с Гарри оказались почти нос к носу. Гарри видел свое отражение в этих туманных глазах.\n\n«И вот где. . ».\n\nМистер Олливандер коснулся шрама молнии на лбу Гарри длинным белым пальцем.\n\n«Мне жаль, что я продал палочку, которая сделала это», - мягко сказал он. «Тринадцать с половиной дюймов. Тис Сильная палочка, очень мощная и попала в чужие руки; ну, если бы я знал, для чего эта палочка выходит в мир; ».\n\nОн покачал головой и затем, к облегчению Гарри, заметил Хагрида.\n\n«Рубеус! Рубеус Хагрид! Как приятно снова тебя видеть; . Дуб, шестнадцать дюймов, довольно гибкий, не так ли?\n\n«Это было, сэр, да», - сказал Хагрид.\n\n«Хорошая палочка. Но я полагаю, они сломали его пополам, когда тебя исключили »? - внезапно сурово сказал мистер Олливандер.\n\n- Э-э- да, да, - сказал Хагрид, шаркая ногами. «У меня все еще есть кусочки», - весело добавил он.\n\n«Но вы же ими не пользуетесь»? - резко сказал мистер Олливандер.\n\n- О нет, сэр, - быстро сказал Хагрид. Гарри заметил, что очень крепко сжимал свой розовый зонтик, когда говорил.\n\n- Хммм, - сказал мистер Олливандер, пронзительно взглянув на Хагрида. «Ну, теперь - мистер. Поттер. Дайте-ка подумать\". Он вытащил из кармана длинную рулетку с серебряными отметками. «Какая у тебя рука с палочкой»?\n\n- Э- ну, я правша, - сказал Гарри.\n\n«Протяни руку. Это оно\". Он измерил Гарри от плеча до пальца, затем от запястья до локтя, от плеча до пола, от колена до подмышки и вокруг головы. При измерении он сказал: «У каждой палочки Олливандера есть сердцевина из могущественной магической субстанции, мистер Поттер. Мы используем волосы единорога, перья хвоста феникса и сердечные струны драконов. Нет двух одинаковых жезлов Олливандера, как и нет двух одинаковых единорогов, драконов или фениксов. И, конечно же, вы никогда не получите таких хороших результатов с палочкой другого волшебника ».\n\nГарри внезапно понял, что рулетка, которая измеряла между его ноздрями, делала это сама. Мистер Олливандер порхал по полкам, снимая коробки.\n\n«Достаточно», - сказал он, и рулетка свернулась кучей на полу. - Хорошо, мистер Поттер. Попробуй это. Буковая древесина и сердечная нить дракона. Девять дюймов. Красиво и гибко. Просто возьми и помаши ».\n\nГарри взял палочку и (чувствуя себя глупо) немного помахал ею, но мистер Олливандер почти сразу выхватил ее у него из рук.\n\n«Клен и перо феникса. Семь дюймов. Довольно хлипко. Попробуй- -\n\nГарри попытался, но едва поднял палочку, как мистер Олливандер выхватил ее.\n\n«Нет, нет, здесь черное дерево и волосы единорога, восемь с половиной дюймов, упругие. Давай, давай, попробуй ».\n\nГарри пытался. И попробовал. Он понятия не имел, чего ждал мистер Олливандер. Груда испытанных жезлов поднималась все выше и выше на тонком стуле, но чем больше палочек мистер Олливандер вытаскивал с полок, тем счастливее он становился.\n\n«Хитрый покупатель, а? Не волнуйтесь, мы где-нибудь найдем здесь идеальную пару - интересно, теперь - да, почему бы и нет - необычное сочетание - падуб и перо феникса, одиннадцать дюймов, красивое и гибкое ».\n\nГарри взял палочку. Он почувствовал внезапное тепло в пальцах. Он поднял палочку над головой, пронес ее вниз по пыльному воздуху, и поток красных и золотых искр вылетел из конца, как фейерверк, отбрасывая танцующие пятна света на стены. Хагрид кричал и хлопал, а мистер Олливандер кричал: «О, браво! Да, действительно, очень хорошо. Так так так ; как любопытно; как очень любопытно. . ».\n\nОн положил палочку Гарри обратно в коробку и завернул ее в коричневую бумагу, продолжая бормотать: «Любопытно; любопытно. . ».\n\n«Извини, - сказал Гарри, - но что любопытного»?\n\nМистер Олливандер пристально посмотрел на Гарри бледным взглядом.\n\n«Я помню каждую палочку, которую я когда-либо продал, мистер Поттер. Каждая палочка. Так получилось, что феникс, чье хвостовое перо находится в твоей палочке, дал еще одно перо - всего одно. Действительно, очень любопытно, что тебе суждено было получить эту палочку, когда она брат - ну ведь брат оставил тебе этот шрам ».\n\nГарри сглотнул.\n\n«Да, тринадцать с половиной дюймов. Ю Действительно любопытно, как это происходит. Помните, палочка выбирает волшебника; . Я думаю, мы должны ожидать от вас многого, мистер Поттер; . В конце концов, Тот-Кого-Нельзя-называть совершил великие дела - ужасные, да, но великие ».\n\nГарри вздрогнул. Он не был уверен, что мистер Олливандер ему слишком нравится. Он заплатил семь золотых галеонов за свою палочку, и мистер Олливандер поклонился им из своей лавки.\n\nВечернее солнце низко садилось в небе, пока Гарри и Хагрид возвращались по Косому переулку, обратно через стену, обратно через Дырявый котел, теперь уже пустой. Гарри вообще не разговаривал, пока они шли по дороге; он даже не заметил, как много людей пялились на них в Подземелье, нагруженных всеми своими забавными пакетами, с полярной совой, спящей в своей клетке на коленях Гарри. Подняться по другому эскалатору на станцию ​​Паддингтон; Гарри понял, где они были, только когда Хагрид похлопал его по плечу.\n\n«Есть время, чтобы перекусить до отправления поезда», - сказал он.\n\nОн купил Гарри гамбургер, и они сели на пластиковые сиденья, чтобы их съесть. Гарри продолжал оглядываться. Как-то все выглядело так странно.\n\n«С тобой все в порядке, Гарри? - Очень тихо, - сказал Хагрид.\n\nГарри не был уверен, что сможет объяснить. У него только что был лучший день рождения в его жизни - и все же - он жевал свой гамбургер, пытаясь подобрать слова.\n\n«Все думают, что я особенный», - сказал он наконец. «Все те люди в« Дырявом котле », профессор Квиррелл, мистер Олливандер; но я вообще ничего не знаю о магии. Как они могут ожидать великих вещей? Я знаменит и даже не могу вспомнить, чем я знаменит. Я не знаю, что случилось, когда Вол - извини - я имею в виду, в ночь, когда умерли мои родители ».\n\nХагрид перегнулся через стол. За дикой бородой и бровями у него была очень добрая улыбка.\n\n«Не волнуйся, Гарри. Вы научитесь достаточно быстро. В Хогвартсе все начинают с самого начала, все будет в порядке. Просто будь собой. Я знаю, это сложно. Тебя выделили, и это всегда сложно. Но вы отлично проведете время в Хогвартсе - я отлично провел - до сих пор, «мелочь».\n\nХагрид помог Гарри сесть на поезд, который должен был отвезти его к Дурслям, затем вручил ему конверт.\n\n«Ваш билет в Хогвартс», - сказал он. «Первое сентября - Кингс-Кросс - все в твоем билете. Если возникнут проблемы с Дурслями, пришлите мне письмо со своей совой, она знает, где меня найти; . До скорой встречи, Гарри ».\n\nПоезд отошел от вокзала. Гарри хотел наблюдать за Хагридом, пока тот не скрылся из виду; он поднялся на сиденье и прижался носом к окну, но моргнул, и Хагрид ушел.\n\nПоследний месяц Гарри с Дурслями не был веселым. Правда, теперь Дадли так боялся Гарри, что не оставался в одной комнате, в то время как тетя Петуния и дядя Вернон не закрывали Гарри в шкафу, не заставляли его что-либо делать и не кричали на него - по сути, они не вообще не разговариваю с ним. Наполовину испуганные, наполовину разъяренные, они вели себя так, как будто любой стул с Гарри был пуст. Хотя это было во многом улучшением, через некоторое время стало немного удручающе.\n\nГарри остался в своей комнате со своей новой совой в компании. Он решил назвать ее Хедвиг, имя, которое он нашел в «Истории магии». Его школьные учебники были очень интересными. Он лежал на кровати и читал до поздней ночи, Хедвиг выскакивала из открытого окна, как ей заблагорассудится. К счастью, тетя Петуния больше не приходила пылесосить, потому что Хедвиг все время приносила мертвых мышей. Каждую ночь перед сном Гарри отмечал еще один день на прикрепленном к стене листе бумаги, отсчитывая до первого сентября.\n\nВ последний день августа он подумал, что ему лучше поговорить с тетей и дядей о том, чтобы добраться до станции Кингс-Кросс на следующий день, поэтому он спустился в гостиную, где они смотрели викторину по телевизору. Он откашлялся, чтобы дать им знать, что он здесь, и Дадли с криком убежал из комнаты.\n\n«Э- дядя Вернон»?\n\nДядя Вернон хмыкнул, показывая, что слушает.\n\n«Э-э- ​​мне нужно быть на Кингс-Кросс завтра, чтобы- поехать в Хогвартс».\n\nДядя Вернон снова хмыкнул.\n\n«Было бы хорошо, если бы вы меня подвезли»?\n\nХрюкать. Гарри предположил, что это означало «да».\n\n\"Спасибо\".\n\nОн собирался вернуться наверх, когда дядя Вернон действительно заговорил.\n\n«Забавный способ добраться до школы волшебников, поезд. У всех волшебных ковров проколы, не так ли?\n\nГарри ничего не сказал.\n\n«А где вообще эта школа»?\n\n«Не знаю», - сказал Гарри, впервые осознав это. Он вытащил из кармана билет, который дал ему Хагрид.\n\n«Я просто сажусь на поезд с платформы девять и три четверти в одиннадцать часов», - прочитал он.\n\nЕго тетя и дядя уставились на него.\n\n«Платформа какая»?\n\n«Девять и три четверти».\n\n«Не говори ерунды, - сказал дядя Вернон. «Нет платформы девять и три четверти».\n\n«Это у меня в билете».\n\n- Лай, - сказал дядя Вернон, - воют безумно, все они. Вот увидишь. Просто подожди. Хорошо, мы отвезем вас на Кингс-Кросс. Мы все равно едем в Лондон завтра, иначе я бы не стал беспокоиться ».\n\n«Почему ты едешь в Лондон»? - спросил Гарри, пытаясь сохранить дружеские отношения.\n\n«Отвезти Дадли в больницу», - прорычал дядя Вернон. «Надо удалить этот румяный хвост, прежде чем он пойдет в Смелтингс».\n\nНа следующее утро Гарри проснулся в пять часов и был слишком взволнован и нервничал, чтобы снова заснуть. Он встал и натянул джинсы, потому что не хотел заходить на станцию ​​в своей волшебной мантии - он переоделся в поезде. Он еще раз проверил свой список в Хогвартсе, чтобы убедиться, что у него есть все необходимое, увидел, что Хедвиг надежно заперта в клетке, а затем прошелся по комнате, ожидая, пока Дурсли встанут. Два часа спустя огромный тяжелый чемодан Гарри был загружен в машину Дурслей, тетя Петуния уговорила Дадли сесть рядом с Гарри, и они уехали.\n\nОни достигли Кингс-Кросс в половине одиннадцатого. Дядя Вернон бросил чемодан Гарри на тележку и откатил его на станцию. Гарри думал, что это было странно добрым, пока дядя Вернон не остановился замертво, глядя на платформы с мерзкой улыбкой на лице.\n\n«Ну вот и ты, мальчик. Платформа девять - платформа десять. Ваша платформа должна быть где-то посередине, но они, кажется, еще не построили ее, не так ли?\n\nКонечно, он был совершенно прав. На одной платформе была большая пластиковая цифра девять, а рядом - большая пластиковая цифра десять, а посередине вообще ничего.\n\n«Удачи», - сказал дядя Вернон с еще более мерзкой улыбкой. Он ушел, не сказав больше ни слова. Гарри повернулся и увидел, что Дурсли уезжают. Все трое смеялись. Во рту Гарри пересохло. Что, черт возьми, он собирался делать? Он начал привлекать много забавных взглядов из-за Хедвиг. Он должен спросить кого-нибудь.\n\nОн остановил проходящего мимо охранника, но не осмелился упомянуть платформу девять и три четверти. Охранник никогда не слышал о Хогвартсе, и когда Гарри даже не мог сказать ему, в какой части страны он находится, он начал раздражаться, как будто Гарри нарочно дурак. В отчаянии Гарри попросил поезд, который ушел в одиннадцать часов, но охранник сказал, что его нет. В конце концов, стражник зашагал прочь, бормоча про расточителей времени. Гарри теперь изо всех сил пытался не поддаться панике. Судя по большим часам на табло прибытия, у него оставалось десять минут, чтобы сесть на поезд до Хогвартса, и он понятия не имел, как это сделать; он застрял посреди станции с чемоданом, который он едва мог поднять, карманом, полным волшебных денег, и большой совой.\n\nХагрид, должно быть, забыл сказать ему что-то, что вам нужно сделать, например, нажать на третий кирпич слева, чтобы попасть в Косой переулок. Он подумал, стоит ли достать палочку и начать постукивать по стойке билетной кассы между платформами девять и десять.\n\nВ этот момент сразу за ним прошла группа людей, и он уловил несколько слов из того, что они говорили.\n\n«- Набитый магглами, конечно-»\n\nГарри обернулся. Говорила полная женщина, которая разговаривала с четырьмя мальчиками, у всех были ярко-рыжие волосы. Каждый из них толкал перед собой ствол, как у Гарри, - а у них была сова.\n\nС колотящимся сердцем Гарри толкнул тележку за ними. Они остановились, и он тоже, достаточно близко, чтобы услышать, что они говорят.\n\n«Теперь, какой номер платформы»? сказала мать мальчиков.\n\n«Девять и три четверти»! - крикнула маленькая девочка, тоже рыжая, державшая ее за руку: «Мама, я не могу пойти. . ».\n\n«Ты недостаточно взрослая, Джинни, теперь молчи. Хорошо, Перси, ты иди первым ».\n\nЧто-то вроде самого старшего двинулось к платформам девять и десять. Гарри наблюдал, стараясь не моргнуть на случай, если он пропустит это - но как только мальчик достиг разделяющего барьера между двумя платформами, большая толпа туристов собралась перед ним, и к тому времени, как последний рюкзак исчез, мальчик исчез.\n\n«Фред, ты следующий», - сказала полная женщина.\n\n«Я не Фред, я Джордж», - сказал мальчик. «Честно говоря, женщина, вы называете себя нашей мамой? Разве ты не можешь сказать, что я Джордж »?\n\n«Извини, Джордж, дорогой».\n\n«Шучу, я Фред», - сказал мальчик и пошел прочь. Его близнец крикнул ему, чтобы он поторопился, и он, должно быть, так и сделал, потому что через секунду он ушел - но как он это сделал?\n\nТеперь третий брат быстро шел к преграде, он был почти у цели - а затем, совершенно неожиданно, его нигде не было.\n\nБольше ничего не было для этого.\n\n«Простите, - сказал Гарри полной женщине.\n\n«Привет, дорогой», - сказала она. «Впервые в Хогвартсе? Рон тоже новенький ».\n\nОна указала на последнего и младшего из своих сыновей. Он был высоким, худым и долговязым, с веснушками, большими руками и ногами и длинным носом.\n\n«Да», - сказал Гарри. «Дело в том, что я не знаю, как-»\n\n«Как попасть на платформу»? - ласково сказала она, и Гарри кивнул.\n\n«Не волнуйтесь, - сказала она. «Все, что вам нужно сделать, это пройти прямо к барьеру между платформами девять и десять. Не останавливайтесь и не бойтесь врезаться в него, это очень важно. Если вы нервничаете, лучше всего сделайте это на бегу. Давай, давай раньше Рона »\n\n« Э- хорошо, - сказал Гарри.\n\nОн повернул тележку и уставился на барьер. Выглядело очень солидно.\n\nОн направился к нему. Люди толкали его на пути к платформам девять и десять. Гарри пошел быстрее. Он собирался врезаться прямо в этот барьер, и тогда у него будут проблемы - наклонившись вперед на своей тележке, он бросился на тяжелый бег - преграда приближалась все ближе и ближе - он не сможет остановиться - тележка вышел из-под контроля - он был в футе от него - он закрыл глаза, готовый к аварии -\n\nЭтого не произошло; он продолжал бежать; он открыл глаза. Алая паровая машина ждала у платформы, набитой людьми. Надпись наверху гласила: «Хогвартс-экспресс», одиннадцать часов. Гарри оглянулся и увидел арку из кованого железа на месте барьера с надписью «Платформа девять» и «Три четверти». Он это сделал.\n\nДым от двигателя плыл над головами болтающей толпы, а кошки всех мастей метались то тут, то там между ног. Совы недовольно улюлюкали друг другу из-за бормотания и скрежета тяжелых стволов.\n\nПервые несколько вагонов уже были забиты студентами, некоторые свешивались из окна, чтобы поговорить со своими семьями, некоторые дрались за места. Гарри столкнул тележку с платформы в поисках свободного места. Он прошел мимо круглолицого мальчика, который говорил: «Бабушка, я снова потерял жабу».\n\n«О, Невилл», - услышал он вздох старухи.\n\nМальчика с дредами окружала небольшая толпа.\n\n«Посмотри на нас, Ли, продолжай».\n\nМальчик поднял крышку коробки в своих руках, и люди вокруг него визжали и кричали, когда что-то внутри высовывало длинную волосатую ногу.\n\nГарри продирался сквозь толпу, пока не обнаружил пустое купе в конце поезда. Сначала он поместил внутрь Хедвиг, а затем начал толкать и тянуть свой сундук к двери поезда. Он попытался поднять его по ступенькам, но с трудом смог поднять один конец и дважды больно уронил его себе на ногу.\n\n«Хочешь руку»? Это был один из рыжеволосых близнецов, которых он преследовал через барьер.\n\n«Да, пожалуйста», - выдохнул Гарри.\n\n«Ой, Фред! Иди и помоги »!\n\nС помощью близнецов чемодан Гарри был наконец спрятан в углу купе.\n\n«Спасибо», - сказал Гарри, убирая потные волосы с глаз.\n\n\"Что это такое\"? - внезапно сказал один из близнецов, указывая на шрам Гарри.\n\n\"Черт побери,\" сказал другой близнец. \"Ты-\"\n\n«Он есть», - сказал первый близнец. «Разве не ты»? - добавил он Гарри.\n\n\"Какая\"? - сказал Гарри.\n\n«Гарри Поттер», - хором произнесли близнецы.\n\n«О, он», - сказал Гарри. «То есть, да, я».\n\nОба мальчика уставились на него, и Гарри почувствовал, что краснеет. Затем, к его облегчению, через открытую дверь поезда раздался голос.\n\n\"Фред? Джордж? Ты там\"?\n\n«Идем, мама»\n\nБросив последний взгляд на Гарри, близнецы сошли с поезда.\n\nГарри сел рядом с окном, откуда, наполовину скрытый, он мог наблюдать за рыжеволосой семьей на платформе и слышать, что они говорят. Их мать только что вынула носовой платок.\n\n«Рон, у тебя что-то на носу».\n\nМладший мальчик попытался отшатнуться, но она схватила его и стала тереть кончик носа.\n\n«Мама- Герофф-» Он высвободился.\n\n«Аааа, есть ли у Икла Ронни хоть какое-то отношение к его носу»? сказал один из близнецов.\n\n«Заткнись», - сказал Рон\n\n«Где Перси»? сказала их мать.\n\n«Он идет сейчас».\n\nВ поле зрения появился старший мальчик. Он уже переоделся в свою развевающуюся черную мантию Хогвартса, и Гарри заметил на его груди блестящий серебряный значок с буквой «P».\n\n«Не могу долго оставаться, мама, - сказал он. «Я впереди, у старших есть два отделения-»\n\n«О, ты префект, Перси»? - сказал один из близнецов с большим удивлением. «Ты должен был что-то сказать, мы понятия не имели».\n\n«Погоди, я думаю, я помню, как он что-то говорил об этом», - сказал другой близнец. - Один раз- -\n\nИли\n\nдва- - Минуту- -\n\nВсе лето-\n\n- Да заткнись, - сказал Префект Перси.\n\n«И вообще, почему Перси получил новые мантии»? сказал один из близнецов.\n\n«Потому что он префект», - нежно сказала их мать. «Хорошо, милый, хорошо, хороших семейств - пришли мне сову, когда доберешься».\n\nОна поцеловала Перси в щеку, и он ушел. Затем она обратилась к близнецам.\n\n«Итак, вы двое - в этом году ведите себя прилично. Если я получу еще одну сову, которая скажет мне, что вы- вы взорвали унитаз или-\n\n- Взорвали унитаз? Мы ни разу не взорвали унитаз ».\n\n«Отличная идея, спасибо, мама»\n\n«Это не смешно. И присмотри за Роном »\n\n«Не волнуйтесь, Икл Ронникинс с нами в безопасности».\n\n«Заткнись», - снова сказал Рон. Он был почти таким же высоким, как близнецы, и его нос был все еще розовым в том месте, где его потерла мать.\n\n«Эй, мама, угадай что? Угадай, кого мы только что встретили в поезде »?\n\nГарри быстро откинулся назад, чтобы они не видели его взгляда.\n\n«Вы знаете того черноволосого мальчика, который был рядом с нами на станции? Знаешь, кто он »?\n\n\"ВОЗ\"?\n\n\"Гарри Поттер\"!\n\nГарри услышал голос маленькой девочки.\n\n«Ой, мама, можно мне сесть в поезд и увидеть его, мама, пожалуйста; ».\n\n«Ты уже видела его, Джинни, а бедный мальчик - не то, на что можно таращиться в зоопарке. Он правда, Фред? Откуда вы знаете\"?\n\n\"Спросил его. Видел его шрам. Это действительно есть - как молния ».\n\n«Бедняжка- неудивительно, что он был один, - подумала я. Он был очень вежлив, когда спросил, как попасть на платформу ».\n\n«Неважно, ты думаешь, он помнит, как выглядит Сами-Знаете-Кто»?\n\nИх мать внезапно стала очень суровой.\n\n«Я запрещаю тебе спрашивать его, Фред. Нет, не смей. Как будто ему нужно напомнить об этом в первый же школьный день ».\n\n«Хорошо, оставь волосы прически».\n\nРаздался свисток.\n\n\"Поторопись\"! - сказала их мать, и трое мальчиков забрались в поезд. Они высунулись из окна, чтобы она поцеловала их на прощание, и их младшая сестра заплакала.\n\n«Не надо, Джинни, мы пришлем тебе кучу сов».\n\n«Мы пришлем вам сиденье для унитаза Хогвартса».\n\n«Джордж»!\n\n«Только шучу, мама»\n\nПоезд тронулся. Гарри увидел, как мать мальчиков машет рукой, а их сестра, наполовину смеясь, наполовину плача, бежит, чтобы не отставать от поезда, пока тот не набрал слишком большую скорость, затем она упала и помахала рукой.\n\nГарри смотрел, как девочка и ее мать исчезают, когда поезд завернул за угол. За окном мелькали дома. Гарри почувствовал сильнейший прилив возбуждения. Он не знал, что собирается делать, но это должно быть лучше, чем то, что он оставил после себя.\n\nДверь купе распахнулась, и вошел самый младший рыжеволосый мальчик.\n\n«Кто-нибудь там сидит»? - спросил он, указывая на сиденье напротив Гарри. «Везде полно».\n\nГарри покачал головой, и мальчик сел. Он взглянул на Гарри, а затем быстро выглянул в окно, делая вид, что не смотрел. Гарри увидел, что у него на носу все еще есть черная отметина.\n\n«Привет, Рон»\n\n. Близнецы вернулись.\n\n«Слушай, мы идем по середине поезда - у Ли Джордана там гигантский тарантул».\n\n- Хорошо, - пробормотал Рон,\n\n- Гарри, - сказал другой близнец, - мы представились? Фред и Джордж Уизли. А это Рон, наш брат. Тогда увидимся позже\".\n\n«Пока», - сказали Гарри и Рон Близнецы задвинули за собой дверь купе.\n\n«Вы действительно Гарри Поттер»? - выпалил Рон.\n\nГарри кивнул.\n\n«Ну что ж, я подумал, что это может быть одна из шуток Фреда и Джорджа», - сказал Рон «И ты действительно понял- ты знаешь. . ».\n\nОн указал на лоб Гарри.\n\nГарри откинул челку, чтобы показать шрам с молнией. Рон смотрел.\n\n«Так вот где Сами-Знаете-Кто-»?\n\n«Да, - сказал Гарри, - но я не могу этого вспомнить».\n\n\"Ничего\"? - нетерпеливо сказал Рон.\n\n«Ну, я помню много зеленого света, но ничего другого».\n\n«Вау», - сказал Рон. Он сел и несколько секунд смотрел на Гарри, а затем, как будто внезапно осознав, что делает, снова быстро взглянул в окно.\n\n«Все ли в вашей семье волшебники»? - спросил Гарри, который нашел Рона таким же интересным, как и Рон.\n\n«Э- да, я так думаю, - сказал Рон, - я думаю, у мамы есть троюродный брат, который работает бухгалтером, но мы никогда не говорим о нем».\n\n«Значит, ты уже должен знать много магии».\n\nУизли явно принадлежали к тем старым волшебным семьям, о которых говорил бледный мальчик из Косого переулка.\n\n«Я слышал, ты переехал жить к магглам», - сказал Рон «Какие они на самом деле»?\n\n«Ужасно- ну, не все. А вот мои тетя, дядя и двоюродный брат. Жаль, что у меня не было трех братьев-волшебников ».\n\n«Пять», - сказал Рон Почему-то он выглядел мрачным. «Я шестой в нашей семье, кто поступил в Хогвартс. Можно сказать, что у меня есть многое, чего нужно достичь. Билл и Чарли уже ушли - Билл был старостой, а Чарли был капитаном квиддича. Теперь Перси префект. Фред и Джордж много бездельничают, но они все равно получают очень хорошие оценки, и все думают, что они действительно забавные. Все ожидают, что я сделаю так же хорошо, как и другие, но если я это сделаю, в этом нет ничего страшного, потому что они сделали это первыми. С пятью братьями тоже никогда не получишь ничего нового. У меня есть старая мантия Билла, старая палочка Чарли и старая крыса Перси ».\n\nРон залез внутрь пиджака и вытащил жирную серую крысу, которая спала.\n\n«Его зовут Скабберс, и он бесполезен, он почти никогда не просыпается. Перси получил сову от моего отца за то, что был назначен старостой, но они не могли позволить себе - я имею в виду, вместо этого я получил Скабберса ».\n\nУши Рона порозовели. Казалось, ему показалось, что он сказал слишком много, потому что он снова стал смотреть в окно.\n\nГарри не думал, что нет ничего плохого в том, что он не может позволить себе сову. В конце концов, у него никогда в жизни не было денег до месяца назад, и он сказал об этом Рону, все о том, что ему придется носить старую одежду Дадли и никогда не получать достойных подарков на день рождения. Похоже, это развеселило Рона.\n\n«; и пока Хагрид не сказал мне, я ничего не знал ни о том, что я волшебник, ни о моих родителях, ни о Волан-де-Морте- -\n\nахнул Рон.\n\n\"Какая\"? - сказал Гарри.\n\n«Ты сказал имя Сами-Знаете-Кого»! - сказал Рон потрясенным и впечатленным голосом. «Я бы подумал, что ты, из всех людей-»\n\n«Я не пытаюсь быть храбрым или что-то в этом роде, говоря это имя, - сказал Гарри, - я просто никогда не знал, что ты не должен. Понимаете, о чем я? Мне нужно многому научиться; . Готов поспорить, - добавил он, впервые озвучив то, что сильно беспокоило его в последнее время, - держу пари, что я худший в классе.\n\n«Вы не будете. Есть множество людей из магловских семей, и они учатся достаточно быстро ».\n\nПока они разговаривали, поезд вывез их из Лондона. Теперь они мчались мимо полей, полных коров и овец. Некоторое время они молчали, глядя, как проносятся поля и переулки.\n\nПримерно в половине первого в коридоре раздался сильный грохот, и улыбающаяся женщина с ямочками на щеках выскользнула из их двери и спросила: «Что-нибудь из тележки, дорогие»?\n\nГарри, который не позавтракал, вскочил на ноги, но уши Рона снова порозовели, и он пробормотал, что принес бутерброды. Гарри вышел в коридор.\n\nУ него никогда не было денег на конфеты с Дурслями, и теперь, когда у него были карманы, гремящие золотом и серебром, он был готов купить столько Марсовых Слитков, сколько сможет унести, но у женщины не было Марсовых Слитков. Что у нее было, так это фасоль Бетти Ботт со вкусом, лучшая жвачка Дробла, шоколадные лягушки, тыквенные пирожные, котелки, лакричные палочки и ряд других странных вещей, которых Гарри никогда в жизни не видел. Не желая ничего упустить, он получил все и заплатил женщине одиннадцать серебряных серпов и семь бронзовых кнатов.\n\nРон смотрел, как Гарри принес все это обратно в купе и опрокинул на свободное место.\n\n«Ты голоден»?\n\n«Голод», - сказал Гарри, откусывая большой кусок тыквенного теста.\n\nРон достал комковатый пакет и развернул его. Внутри было четыре бутерброда. Он разорвал одну из них и сказал: «Она всегда забывает, что я не люблю солонину».\n\n«Обменяй тебя на одну из них», - сказал Гарри, поднимая пирожное. «Продолжай-»\n\n«Ты не хочешь этого, все сухо», - сказал Рон «У нее мало времени, - быстро добавил он, - ну знаешь, нас пятеро».\n\n«Давай, выпей пирожного», - сказал Гарри, которому раньше никогда не было, чем поделиться, да и вообще не с кем было. Было приятно сидеть здесь с Роном и перебирать все пирожные, пирожные и конфеты Гарри (о бутербродах забыли).\n\n\"Что это\"? - спросил Гарри Рона, держа пачку шоколадных лягушек. «На самом деле они не лягушки»? Он начинал чувствовать, что его ничто не удивит.\n\n«Нет, - сказал Рон, - но посмотри, какая карта. Я скучаю по Агриппе ».\n\n\"Какая\"?\n\n«О, конечно, ты бы не знал - у шоколадных лягушек есть карточки, внутри них, ну, знаешь, чтобы собирать - знаменитые ведьмы и волшебники. У меня около пятисот, но нет Агриппы или Птолемея ».\n\nГарри развернул шоколадную лягушку и взял карточку. На нем было видно мужское лицо. На нем были очки-полумесяцы, у него был длинный кривой нос, развевающиеся серебряные волосы, борода и усы. Под фотографией было имя Альбус Дамблдор.\n\n«Так это Дамблдор»! - сказал Гарри.\n\n«Не говори мне, что никогда не слышал о Дамблдоре»! сказал Рон: «Можно мне лягушку? Я мог бы получить Агриппу - спасибо -\n\nГарри перевернул свою карточку и прочитал:\n\nАЛЬБУС ДАМБЛДОР В НАСТОЯЩЕЕ ВРЕМЯ \n\nНАЧАЛЬНИК ХОГВАРТА.\n\nСчитающийся многими величайшими волшебниками современности, Дамблдор особенно известен победой над темным волшебником Гриндельвальдом в 1945 году, открытием двенадцати способов использования драконьей крови и работой по алхимии со своим напарником Николасом Фламелем. Профессор Дамблдор любит камерную музыку и боулинг.\n\nГарри перевернул карточку и, к своему удивлению, увидел, что лицо Дамблдора исчезло.\n\n\"Он ушел\"!\n\n«Ну, ты не можешь ожидать, что он будет торчать здесь весь день, - сказал Рон - Он вернется. Нет, у меня снова есть Моргана, и у меня ее около шести; ты хочешь этого? Можно начинать собирать ».\n\nВзгляд Рона упал на груду шоколадных лягушек, ожидающих разворачивания.\n\n«Угощайся, - сказал Гарри. «Но, знаете ли, в мире маглов люди просто остаются на фотографиях».\n\n«Они? Что, они вообще не двигаются »? - изумился Рон. «Странно»!\n\nГарри смотрел, как Дамблдор бочком вернулся к картинке на его карточке и одарил его легкой улыбкой. Рон больше интересовался поеданием лягушек, чем просмотром карточек «Знаменитые ведьмы и волшебники», но Гарри не мог оторвать от них глаз. Вскоре у него были не только Дамблдор и Моргана, но и Хенгист из Вудкрофта, Альберик Груннион, Цирцея, Парацельс и Мерлин. В конце концов он оторвал взгляд от друидки Клиодны, которая чесала нос, чтобы открыть пакет с бобами любого вкуса Берти Ботта.\n\n«Вы должны быть осторожны с ними», - предупредил Рон Гарри. «Когда говорят« каждый аромат », они имеют в виду все вкусы - вы знаете, вы получаете все обычные, такие как шоколад, перечная мята и мармелад, но тогда вы можете получить шпинат, печень и рубец. Джордж считает, что когда-то у него был вкус бугера ».\n\nРон взял зеленую фасоль, внимательно посмотрел на нее и откусил от угла.\n\n«Блеааа- видите? Ростки ».\n\nОни хорошо провели время, поедая фасоль Every Flavor. Гарри получил тосты, кокос, печеные бобы, клубнику, карри, траву, кофе, сардины, и даже был достаточно храбрым, чтобы откусить конец от забавного серого, к которому Рон не прикоснулся, а это оказался перец.\n\nСельская местность, пролетавшая теперь за окном, становилась все более дикой. Ухоженные поля исчезли. Теперь там были леса, извилистые реки и темно-зеленые холмы.\n\nВ дверь их купе постучали, и вошел круглолицый мальчик, которого Гарри прошел на платформе девять и три четверти. Он выглядел заплаканным.\n\n«Извините, - сказал он, - но вы вообще видели жабу»?\n\nКогда они покачали головами, он причитал: «Я потерял его! Он уходит от меня »!\n\n«Он появится», - сказал Гарри.\n\n«Да», - жалко сказал мальчик. «Хорошо, если ты его увидишь. . ».\n\nОн ушел.\n\n«Не знаю, почему он так обеспокоен», - сказал Рон, «Если бы я принес жабу, я бы потерял ее как можно быстрее. Имейте в виду, я принес Скабберса, поэтому я не могу разговаривать ».\n\nКрыса все еще дремала у Рона на коленях.\n\n«Он мог умереть, и вы не заметили бы разницы», - с отвращением сказал Рон. «Вчера я пыталась сделать его желтым, чтобы сделать его более интересным, но заклинание не сработало. Я тебе покажу, смотри. . ».\n\nОн порылся в своем сундуке и вытащил палочку, которая выглядела потрепанной. Он был местами сколот, а на конце блестело что-то белое.\n\n«Волосы единорога почти выпирают. В любом случае- -\n\nОн только что поднял палочку, когда дверь купе снова открылась. Мальчик без жабы вернулся, но на этот раз с ним была девочка. На ней уже была новая мантия Хогвартса.\n\n«Кто-нибудь видел жабу? - Невилл потерял одного, - сказала она. У нее был властный голос, густые каштановые волосы и довольно большие передние зубы.\n\n«Мы уже сказали ему, что не видели этого», - сказал Рон, но девушка не слушала, она смотрела на палочку в его руке.\n\n«О, ты занимаешься магией? Тогда давай посмотрим ».\n\nОна села. Рон выглядел озадаченным.\n\n«Э-э- ​​хорошо».\n\nОн прочистил горло.\n\n«Солнце, ромашки, сливочное масло, Сделай эту тупую жирную крысу желтой».\nОн взмахнул палочкой, но ничего не произошло. Коршун оставался серым и крепким сном.\n\n«Вы уверены, что это настоящее заклинание»? сказала девушка. «Ну, это не очень хорошо, правда? Я пробовал несколько простых заклинаний просто для практики, и все это у меня сработало. Никто из членов моей семьи не занимается магией, когда я получил свое письмо, это никогда не было таким сюрпризом, но я был очень доволен, конечно, я имею в виду, что это лучшая школа колдовства, какая есть, я слышал- Я, конечно, выучил все наши учебники наизусть, надеюсь, этого будет достаточно - кстати, я Гермиона Грейнджер, а ты кто?\n\nОна сказала все это очень быстро.\n\nГарри посмотрел на Рона и по его ошеломленному лицу с облегчением увидел, что он тоже не выучил все учебники наизусть.\n\n«Я Рон Уизли», - пробормотал Рон.\n\n«Гарри Поттер», - сказал Гарри.\n\n\"Ты серьезно\"? - сказала Гермиона. «Я, конечно, знаю о тебе все - у меня есть несколько дополнительных книг для ознакомления, а ты изучаешь« Современную историю магии »,« Взлет и падение темных искусств »и« Великие волшебные события двадцатого века ».\n\n«Я»? сказал Гарри, чувствуя себя ошеломленным.\n\n«Боже, разве ты не знал, я бы узнала все, что могла, будь это я», - сказала Гермиона. «Кто-нибудь из вас знает, в каком доме вы будете? Я все расспрашивал и надеюсь, что нахожусь в Гриффиндоре, это звучит, безусловно, лучше всего; Я слышал, что в этом участвовал сам Дамблдор, но, полагаю, Когтевран был бы не так уж плох; . В любом случае, нам лучше пойти и поискать жабу Невилла. Вам двоим лучше переодеться, я надеюсь, мы скоро будем там ».\n\nИ она ушла, забрав с собой мальчика без жабы.\n\n«В каком бы доме я ни находился, я надеюсь, что ее там нет», - сказал Рон Он бросил палочку обратно в багажник. «Глупое заклинание - Джордж дал его мне, держу пари, он знал, что это было неудачей».\n\n«В каком доме твои братья»? - спросил Гарри.\n\n«Гриффиндор», - сказал Рон Мрак, похоже, снова остановился на нем. «Мама и папа тоже были в этом. Я не знаю, что они скажут, если я не буду. Не думаю, что Когтевран был бы таким уж плохим, но представьте, если бы меня отправили в Слизерин ».\n\n«Это дом Вол- я имею в виду, Сами-Знаете-Кто был»?\n\n«Ага», - сказал Рон Он плюхнулся на свое место с подавленным видом.\n\n«Знаешь, я думаю, что концы усов Скабберса немного светлее», - сказал Гарри, пытаясь отвлечься от мыслей Рона. «Так что же твои старшие братья сейчас, когда они уехали»?\n\nГарри было интересно, что сделал волшебник, закончив школу.\n\n«Чарли в Румынии изучает драконов, а Билл в Африке что-то делает для Гринготтса, - сказал Рон - Вы слышали о Гринготтсе? Об этом говорилось в «Ежедневном пророке», но я не думаю, что вы уловили это с маглами - кто-то пытался ограбить хранилище строгого режима ».\n\nГарри уставился.\n\n\"В самом деле? Что с ними случилось\"?\n\n«Ничего, поэтому это такие важные новости. Их не поймали. Мой папа говорит, что Гринготтс обошел, должно быть, могущественный Темный волшебник, но они не думают, что что-то взяли, вот что странно. «Конечно, все пугаются, когда происходит что-то подобное, если за этим стоит Сами-Знаете-Кто».\n\nГарри мысленно прокрутил эту новость. Он начинал испытывать укол страха каждый раз, когда упоминался Сами-Знаете-Кто. Он предположил, что все это было частью входа в волшебный мир, но было намного удобнее сказать «Волан-де-Морт», не беспокоясь.\n\n«Какая ваша любимая команда по квиддичу»? - спросил Рон.\n\n- Э- я ничего не знаю, - признался Гарри.\n\n\"Какая\"! Рон выглядел ошеломленным. «Ой, подождите, это лучшая игра в мире-» И он ушел, объясняя все о четырех шарах и позициях семи игроков, описывая знаменитые игры, в которых он был со своими братьями, и метлу, которую он » Хотел бы получить, если бы у него были деньги. Он как раз проводил Гарри через тонкости игры, когда дверь купе снова распахнулась, но на этот раз это был не Невилл, мальчик без жабы, и не Гермиона Грейнджер.\n\nВошли три мальчика, и Гарри сразу узнал среднего: это был бледный мальчик из магазина халатов мадам Малкин. Он смотрел на Гарри с гораздо большим интересом, чем в Косом переулке.\n\n\"Это правда\"? он сказал. «В поезде говорят, что Гарри Поттер в этом купе. Так это ты? »\n\n«Да», - сказал Гарри. Он смотрел на других мальчиков. Оба они были коренастыми и выглядели очень злобно. Стоя по обе стороны от бледного мальчика, они были похожи на телохранителей.\n\n«О, это Крэбб, а это Гойл», - небрежно сказал бледный мальчик, заметив, куда смотрит Гарри. «А меня зовут Малфой, Драко Малфой».\n\nРон легонько закашлялся, возможно, скрывая смешок. Драко Малфой посмотрел на него.\n\n«Думаешь, мое имя смешное, а? Не нужно спрашивать, кто ты. Мой отец сказал мне, что у всех Уизли рыжие волосы, веснушки и больше детей, чем они могут себе позволить ».\n\nОн снова повернулся к Гарри. - Скоро вы обнаружите, что одни волшебные семьи намного лучше других, Поттер. Вы же не хотите заводить друзей не с тем. Я могу вам помочь ».\n\nОн протянул руку, чтобы пожать Гарри руку, но Гарри не взял ее.\n\n«Думаю, я могу сказать, кто не такой, спасибо, - холодно сказал он.\n\nДрако Малфой не покраснел, но на его бледных щеках появился розовый оттенок.\n\n«На твоем месте я был бы осторожен, Поттер», - медленно сказал он. «Если вы не станете немного вежливее, вы пойдете тем же путем, что и ваши родители. Они тоже не знали, что для них хорошо. Вы общаетесь с такой сволочью, как Уизли и этот Хагрид, и это отразится на вас ».\n\nИ Гарри, и Рон встали.\n\n«Повтори это еще раз», - сказал Рон, его лицо было таким же красным, как и его волосы.\n\n«Ой, ты собираешься драться с нами»? Малфой усмехнулся.\n\n«Если ты не уйдешь сейчас», - сказал Гарри смелее, чем он чувствовал, потому что Крэбб и Гойл были намного крупнее его или Рона.\n\n«Но мы же не любим ноги уезжать, не так ли, мальчики? Мы съели всю нашу еду, а у вас, кажется, еще есть ».\n\nГойл потянулся к шоколадным лягушкам рядом с Роном - Рон прыгнул вперед, но прежде, чем он даже коснулся Гойла, Гойл издал ужасный вопль.\n\nScabbers крыса свисала с его пальца, острые маленькие зубки глубоко вонзились в сустав Гойла - Крэбб и Малфой попятились, когда Гойл с воем размахивал Скабберсом из стороны в сторону, а когда Скабберс наконец отлетел и ударился в окно, все трое исчезли на глазах один раз. Возможно, они подумали, что среди сладостей прячется еще одна крыса, или, может быть, они услышали шаги, потому что секундой позже вошла Гермиона Грейнджер.\n\n«Что происходит»?? - сказала она, глядя на сладости по всему полу и на Рона, поднимающего Коршу за хвост.\n\n«Я думаю, его вырубили», - сказал Рон Гарри. Он внимательно посмотрел на Скабберса. «Нет- я не верю в это - он снова заснул-»\n\nТак и было.\n\n«Вы встречались с Малфоем раньше»?\n\nГарри рассказал об их встрече в Косом переулке.\n\n«Я слышал о его семье», - мрачно сказал Рон. «Они были одними из первых, кто вернулся на нашу сторону после исчезновения Сами-Знаете-Кто. Сказал, что они были околдованы. Папа этому не верит. Он говорит, что отцу Малфоя не требовалось оправдание, чтобы перейти на Темную сторону ». Он повернулся к Гермионе. «Мы можем вам чем-то помочь»?\n\n«Тебе лучше поторопиться и надеть мантию, я только что был на фронте, чтобы спросить кондуктора, и он говорит, что мы почти у цели. Вы ведь не дрались? У тебя будут проблемы еще до того, как мы доберемся до места »!\n\n«Королева боролась, а не мы», - сказал Рон, сердито глядя на нее. «Не могли бы вы уйти, пока мы переодеваемся»?\n\n«Хорошо, я зашла сюда только потому, что люди снаружи ведут себя очень по-детски, бегают взад и вперед по коридорам», - сказала Гермиона снисходительным голосом. «А у тебя, кстати, грязь на носу, ты знал»?\n\nРон впился в нее взглядом, когда она ушла. Гарри выглянул в окно. Сгущалась темнота. Он видел горы и леса под темно-фиолетовым небом. Поезд действительно замедлился.\n\nОн и Рон сняли куртки и натянули длинные черные мантии. Обувь Рона была для него коротковата, под ними были видны его кроссовки.\n\nВ поезде эхом разнесся голос: «Мы доберемся до Хогвартса через пять минут. Пожалуйста, оставьте свой багаж в поезде, в школу его отвезут отдельно ».\n\nЖивот Гарри подергивался от нервов, а Рон, как он увидел, выглядел бледным под своими веснушками. Они наполнили карманы последними конфетами и присоединились к толпе, заполнившей коридор.\n\nПоезд замедлился и наконец остановился. Люди пробивались к двери и выходили на крохотную темную платформу. Гарри задрожал в холодном ночном воздухе. Затем над головами студентов закружилась лампа, и Гарри услышал знакомый голос: «Первые годы! Первые годы здесь! Хорошо, Гарри »?\n\nБольшое волосатое лицо Хагрида сияло над морем голов.\n\n«Давай, следуй за мной - еще первые годы? Умеешь делать шаг! Первые годы следуют за мной »!\n\nПоскользнувшись и спотыкаясь, они последовали за Хагридом по узкой крутой тропе. По обе стороны от них было так темно, что Гарри подумал, что там должны быть толстые деревья. Никто много не говорил. Невилл, мальчик, терявший жабу, раз или два принюхался.\n\n«Вы все впервые увидите Хогвартс за секунду, - крикнул Хагрид через плечо, - только вот здесь, за поворотом».\n\nБыло громкое «Ооооо»!\n\nУзкая тропинка внезапно открылась на край большого черного озера. На другой стороне высокой горы, окна которой сверкали в звездном небе, возвышался огромный замок с множеством башен и башен.\n\n«Не больше четырех на лодку»! - крикнул Хагрид, указывая на флотилию маленьких лодок, стоящих в воде у берега. За Гарри и Роном в лодку последовали Невилл и Гермиона.\n\n«Все в»? - крикнул Хагрид, у которого была лодка. «Ну тогда - ВПЕРЕД»!\n\nИ флотилия маленьких лодок внезапно двинулась в путь, скользя по озеру, гладкому, как стекло. Все молчали, глядя на огромный замок над головой. Он возвышался над ними, когда они подходили все ближе и ближе к утесу, на котором он стоял.\n\n«Опустив голову»! - завопил Хагрид, когда первые лодки достигли обрыва; все они склонили головы, и маленькие лодки пронесли их сквозь завесу из плюща, скрывавшую широкий проем в скале. Их несли по темному туннелю, который, казалось, вел их прямо под замком, пока они не достигли своего рода подземной гавани, где они карабкались по камням и гальке.\n\n«Эй, ты там! Это твоя жаба »? - сказал Хагрид, проверявший лодки, когда из них вылезали люди.\n\n«Тревор»! - блаженно воскликнул Невилл, протягивая руки. Затем они карабкались по проходу в скале за лампой Хагрида и наконец вышли на гладкую влажную траву прямо в тени замка.\n\nОни поднялись по каменным ступеням и столпились у огромной дубовой входной двери.\n\n«Все здесь? Ты там, жаба у тебя еще есть »?\n\nХагрид поднял гигантский кулак и трижды постучал в дверь замка.",

        "en": "One afternoon I was sitting outside the Cafe cie la Paix in Paris, watching the people passing along the street. I was wondering why some people were very poor while others were so rich.\n\nSuddenly I heard somebody call my name.\n\nI turned round and saw Lord Murchison.We had not met since we were at Oxford University together, nearly ten years before, and I was pleased to see him again. We shook hands warmly.\n\nI had liked him very much at Oxford, and we had been very good friends. He had been so handsome, so full of life, and a very honest young man. We used to say that he would be the best person in the world if he was not always so honest. But I think we really admired him for his honesty.\n\nNow, looking at him ten years later, he seemed different. He looked anxious and worried, and he seemed to have doubts about something. I could not believe that he was in doubt about religion or politics, because he always had such definite opinions about everything. So I thought the problem must be a woman.\n\nI asked him if he was married yet.\n\n‘I don’t understand women well enough to marry one,’ he answered.\n\n‘My dear Gerald,’ I said, ‘it is our job to love women, not to understand them.’\n\n‘I can’t love anyone that I can’t trust,’ he answered.\n\n‘I think you have a mystery in your life, Gerald,’ I said. ‘Tell me about it.’\n\n‘Let’s go for a drive,’ he answered. ‘It’s too crowded here. No, not a yellow carriage – there, that dark green one will be all right.’\n\nAnd in a few moments we were driven away from the cafe.\n\n‘Where shall we gо to?’ I said.\n\n‘Oh, I don’t mind!’ he answered. ‘The restaurant in the Bois de Boulogne? We can have dinner there, and you can tell me about yourself.’\n\n‘I want to hear about you first,’ I said. ‘Tell me about your mystery.’\n\nHe took a little leather case from his pocket and gave it to me. I opened it. Inside was a photograph of a woman. She was tall and beautiful, with long hair, and large secretive eyes. Her clothes looked very expensive.\n\n‘What do you think of that face,’ he said.’ Is it an honest face?’\n\nI examined the face in the photograph carefully. It seemed to me to be the face of a woman with a secret. But I could not say if that secret was good or bad. The beauty of the face was full of mystery, and the faint smile on the lips made me think of the smile of the Egyptian Sphinx in the moonlight. Or was it the mysterious smile that vou sometimes see on the face of Leonardo’s painting, the Mona Lisa, in the Louvre in Paris?\n\n‘Well,’ he cried impatiently, ‘what do you think?’\n\n‘A beautiful sphinx,’ I answered.’ Tell me all about her.’\n\n‘Not now,’ he said. ‘After dinner.’\n\nWhen we were drinking our coffee and smoking our cigarettes after dinner, I reminded him, and he told me this story:\n\n‘One evening,’ he said, ‘I was walking down Bond Street in London at about five o’clock. There were a lot of carriages, and the traffic was moving very slowly. There was a small yellow carriage on my side of the road which, for some reason or other, caught my attention. As the carriage passed, I saw the face that I showed you in the photograph earlier. It went straight to my heart. All that night, I thought about the face, and all the next day. I looked for the yellow carriage in the usual places, but I couldn’t find it. I began to think that the beautiful stranger was only something from a dream.\n\n‘About a week later, I went to have dinner with Madame de Rastail. Dinner was for eight o’clock, but at half past eight we were still waiting in the sitting room. Finally the servant threw open the door and said «Lady Alroy». A woman entered the room — and it was the woman I was looking for! The woman in the yellow carriage.\n\n‘She came into the sitting room very slowly, looking lovely in a grey dress. I was pleased and excited when Madame de Rastail asked me to take Lady Alroy in to dinner. Lady Alroy then sat next to me at the table.\n\n‘After we sat down, I said quite innocently, «I think I saw you in Bond Street not long ago, Lady Alroy».\n\n‘She became very pale, and said to me in a low voice, «Please don’t talk so loudly. Someone may hear you».\n\n‘I felt unhappy about such a bad start to our conversation, and I started talking quickly about French theatre and other unimportant things. She spoke very little, always in the same low musical voice. She seemed to be afraid that someone might be listening.\n\n‘I fell madly in love, and I was excited by the mystery that seemed to surround her. I wanted to know more — much more — about this mysterious lady.\n\n‘She left very soon after dinner, and when she was going, I asked if I could visit her. She said nothing for a moment, looked round to see if anyone was near us, and then said, «Yes. Tomorrow at a quarter to five».\n\n‘I asked Madame de Rastail to tell me about her, but I learned only that her husband had died, and she lived in a beautiful house in the most expensive part of London. I left soon after that, and went home.\n\n‘The next day I arrived at her London house at exactly a quarter to five. I asked to see Lady Alroy but I was told by a servant that she had just gone out.\n\n‘I went to the club, very unhappy and quite confused. After some thought, I wrote a letter. I asked her if I could try again another afternoon.\n\n‘I had no answer for several days, but at last I got a letter saying that I could visit her on Sunday at four o’clock. At the end of the letter there was a strange note: «Please don’t write to me here again,» it said. «I will explain when I see you».\n\n‘On Sunday she was at home when I visited her, and she was perfectly nice to me. But when I was leaving, she said, «If you want to write to me again, will you address your letter to: Mrs Knox, Whitaker’s Library, Green Street? There are reasons why I can’t receive letters in my own house».\n\n‘After that, I saw her often. She continued to be pleasant and mysterious. I thought for a time that she might be in the power of a man, but I could not believe it.\n\n‘At last I decided to ask her to be my wife. I wrote to her at the library and asked her to see me the following Monday, at six o’clock. She answered yes, and I was wonderfully happy. I was very much in love with her, you understand. Perhaps because of the mystery surrounding her. No, no, that’s not right! I loved the woman.The mystery worried me, it’s true. It made me angry.’\n\n‘So you discovered the answer to the mystery?’ I cried.\n\n‘In a way,’ he answered. ‘On Monday I had lunch with my uncle in his house in Regent’s Park. After lunch, I wanted some exercise, and I decided to walk to Piccadilly. The shortest way is through a lot of poor little streets. I was going along one of these when I suddenly saw Lady Alroy in front of me. Her face was half-hidden by a large hat, but there was no doubt in my mind.\n\n‘She was walking fast. When she came to the last house in the street, she went up the steps to the front door, took a key from her bag, unlocked the door and went in.\n\n«So this is the mystery,» I said to myself, and I hurried to the front of the house. It seemed to be a place where people can rent rooms.\n\n‘She had dropped her handkerchief when she took the key out of her bag. It was lying on the doorstep, and I picked it up and put it in my pocket.\n\n‘At six o’clock, I went to see her as we had arranged. She was lying on a sofa in a silver-coloured dress and looked very lovely.\n\nI’m so glad to see you,» she said. «I haven’t been out all day».\n\n‘I stared at her, very surprised. I pulled the handkerchief out of my pocket, and gave it to her. » You dropped this in Cunmor Street this afternoon, Lady Alroy,» I said very calmly.\n\n‘She looked at me in terror, but she didn’t take the handkerchief.\n\n«What were vou doing there»? I asked.\n\n«What right have you to question me»? she answered.\n\n«The right of a man who loves you,» I said. «I came here to ask you to be my wife».\n\n‘She hid her face in her hands, but I could see the tears pouring from her eyes.\n\n«You must tell me,» I continued.\n\n‘She stood up and, through her tears, she looked straight into my eyes. «Lord Murchison,» she said. «There is nothing to tell you».\n\n«You went to meet somebody»! I cried. «This is your mystery».\n\n‘Her face went terribly white, and she said, «I did not go to meet anybody».\n\n«That’s not true,» I said.\n\n«It is true,» she replied.\n\n‘I was mad — completely out of control. I don’t know what I said, but I said terrible things to her. Finally I rushed out of the house. She wrote me a letter the next day, but I sent it back unopened, and left for Norway with my friend, Alan Colville.\n\n‘After a month in Norway, I returned to London. When I returned I saw in the Morning Post newspaper a report about the death of Lady Alroy. She had caught a very bad cold at the theatre one evening, and had died a few days later.\n\n‘I shut myself in my rooms and saw nobody for days. I had loved her so much, so madly. God! I had loved that woman!’\n\n‘You went to the street – to the house in it?’ I said.\n\n‘Yes, ‘he answered. ‘One day I went to Cumnor Street. I had to go. Doubts were destroying my mind. I knocked on the door, and a woman of good appearance opened it. I asked her if she had any rooms to rent.\n\n«Well, sir,» she replied politely, «the sitting room is really taken, but I haven’t seen the lady for three months. And the rent hasn’t been paid, so I think I can let you have it».\n\n«Is this the lady »? I asked, and I showed her the photograph.\n\n«Oh, yes! That’s her»! she said. «When is she coming back, sir»?\n\n«The lady is dead,» I replied.\n\n«Oh dear»! said the woman. «I’m very sorry to hear it. She paid me three pounds a week and she just came and sat in my sitting room sometimes».\n\n«Did she meet someone here »? I said.\n\n«No, sir,» said the woman. «Never. She always came alone, and she saw nobody».\n\n«What did she do here »? I cried.\n\n«She sat in the room, sir, reading books,» answered the woman. «Sometimes she had tea, but always alone».\n\n‘I didn’t know what to say, so I gave the woman five pounds and walked home. What do you think it meant? Do you think the woman’s story was true?’\n\n‘Yes, I do,’ I said.\n\n‘Then why did Lady Alroy go there ?’\n\n‘Gerald,’ I answered, ‘Lady Alroy was simply a woman who had to have a mystery. She took the room for the pleasure of going there secretly. She imagined that she was a mysterious character in a story. She had a great love to secrets and mysteries, but she herself was just a sphinx without a secret.’\n\n‘Do you really think so?’ he said.\n\n‘I’m sure of it,’ I said.\n\nHe took the leather case out of his pocket, opened it, and looked at the photograph.\n\n‘I’ll never be sure,’ he said at last.",
        "ru": "Однажды днем ​​я сидел у кафе cie la Paix в Париже и смотрел на людей, идущих по улице. Мне было интересно, почему одни люди были очень бедными, а другие - такими богатыми.\n\nВдруг я услышал, как кто-то зовет меня по имени.\n\nЯ обернулся и увидел лорда Мерчисона. Мы не встречались с тех пор, как были вместе в Оксфордском университете, почти десять лет назад, и я был рад снова его увидеть. Мы тепло пожали друг другу руки.\n\nОн мне очень понравился в Оксфорде, и мы были очень хорошими друзьями. Он был таким красивым, таким полным жизни и очень честным молодым человеком. Мы говорили, что он был бы лучшим человеком в мире, если бы не всегда был таким честным. Но я думаю, что мы действительно восхищались его честностью.\n\nТеперь, глядя на него десять лет спустя, он казался другим. Он выглядел встревоженным и встревоженным и, казалось, в чем-то сомневался. Я не мог поверить, что он сомневался в религии или политике, потому что у него всегда были такие определенные мнения обо всем. Я подумал, что проблема в женщине.\n\nЯ спросил его, женат ли он еще.\n\n«Я недостаточно хорошо понимаю женщин, чтобы жениться на одной», - ответил он.\n\n«Мой дорогой Джеральд, - сказал я, - наша работа - любить женщин, а не понимать их».\n\n«Я не могу любить никого, кому не могу доверять», - ответил он.\n\n«Я думаю, что в твоей жизни есть загадка, Джеральд, - сказал я. 'Расскажи мне об этом'.\n\n«Поехали кататься, - ответил он. 'Здесь слишком много народу. Нет, не желтая карета - вот с темно-зеленой все будет хорошо ».\n\nИ через несколько мгновений нас увезли из кафе.\n\n\"Куда мы пойдем\"? Я сказал.\n\n«О, я не против»! он ответил. - Ресторан в Булонском лесу? Мы можем там пообедать, и ты расскажешь мне о себе ».\n\n«Я хочу сначала услышать о тебе», - сказал я. «Расскажи мне о своей тайне».\n\nОн вынул из кармана небольшой кожаный футляр и отдал мне. Я открыл это. Внутри была фотография женщины. Она была высокой и красивой, с длинными волосами и большими загадочными глазами. Ее одежда выглядела очень дорогой.\n\n«Что вы думаете об этом лице» - сказал он. Это честное лицо?\n\nЯ внимательно осмотрел лицо на фотографии. Мне показалось, что это лицо женщины с тайной. Но я не мог сказать, хорош этот секрет или плох. Красота лица была таинственной, а слабая улыбка на губах напомнила мне улыбку египетского сфинкса в лунном свете. Или это таинственная улыбка, которую иногда можно увидеть на картине Леонардо «Мона Лиза» в Лувре в Париже?\n\n«Ну, - нетерпеливо воскликнул он, - что ты думаешь»?\n\n«Прекрасный сфинкс, - ответил я». Расскажи мне о ней все ».\n\n«Не сейчас», - сказал он. 'После ужина'.\n\nКогда мы пили кофе и курили сигареты после обеда, я напомнил ему, и он рассказал мне эту историю:\n\n«Однажды вечером, - сказал он, - я шел по Бонд-стрит в Лондоне около пяти часов. Экипажей было много, движение очень медленно. На моей стороне дороги стояла небольшая желтая карета, которая по тем или иным причинам привлекла мое внимание. Когда карета проезжала мимо, я увидел лицо, которое показывал вам на фотографии ранее. Это попало прямо в мое сердце. Всю ночь я думал о лице и весь следующий день. Я искал желтую карету в обычных местах, но не нашел. Я начал думать, что прекрасная незнакомка была всего лишь чем-то из сна.\n\n«Примерно через неделю я пошел ужинать с мадам де Растай. Ужин был на восемь часов, но в половине девятого мы все еще ждали в гостиной. Наконец слуга распахнул дверь и сказал: «Леди Алрой». В комнату вошла женщина - и это была женщина, которую я искал! Женщина в желтой карете.\n\nОна очень медленно вошла в гостиную, прекрасно выглядя в сером платье. Я был доволен и взволнован, когда мадам де Растай попросила меня пригласить леди Алрой на обед. Затем леди Алрой села за стол рядом со мной.\n\n«После того, как мы сели, я совершенно невинно сказал:« Кажется, я недавно видел вас на Бонд-стрит, леди Алрой ».\n\nОна очень побледнела и тихо сказала мне: «Пожалуйста, не говори так громко. Кто-то может вас услышать ».\n\n«Я был недоволен таким неудачным началом нашего разговора, и я начал быстро говорить о французском театре и других неважных вещах. Она говорила очень мало, всегда тем же низким музыкальным голосом. Казалось, она боялась, что кто-то ее подслушает.\n\n«Я безумно влюбился, и я был взволнован тайной, которая, казалось, окружала ее. Я хотел узнать больше - гораздо больше - об этой загадочной даме.\n\n«Она ушла вскоре после обеда, и когда она уходила, я спросил, могу ли я навестить ее. Некоторое время она молчала, оглянулась, чтобы посмотреть, нет ли рядом с нами кого-нибудь, а затем сказала: «Да. Завтра без четверти пять ».\n\n«Я попросил мадам де Растай рассказать мне о ней, но узнал только, что ее муж умер, а она живет в красивом доме в самом дорогом районе Лондона. Я ушел вскоре после этого и пошел домой.\n\nНа следующий день я прибыл в ее лондонский дом ровно без четверти пять. Я попросил о встрече с леди Алрой, но слуга сказал мне, что она только что ушла.\n\n«Я пошел в клуб очень несчастный и совершенно растерянный. Поразмыслив, я написал письмо. Я спросил ее, могу ли я попробовать еще раз в другой день.\n\n«Я не получала ответа несколько дней, но наконец получила письмо, в котором говорилось, что я могу навестить ее в воскресенье в четыре часа. В конце письма была странная пометка: «Пожалуйста, больше не пишите мне сюда», - говорилось в нем. «Я объясню, когда увижу тебя».\n\n«В воскресенье она была дома, когда я навестил ее, и она была очень добра со мной. Но когда я уходил, она сказала: «Если вы хотите написать мне еще раз, вы направите свое письмо по адресу: миссис Нокс, Библиотека Уитакера, Грин-стрит? Есть причины, по которым я не могу получать письма в собственном доме ».\n\n«После этого я часто ее видел. Она продолжала оставаться приятной и загадочной. Какое-то время я думал, что она может быть во власти мужчины, но не мог в это поверить.\n\n«Наконец я решил попросить ее стать мне женой. Я написал ей в библиотеке и попросил ее встретиться со мной в следующий понедельник, в шесть часов. Она ответила утвердительно, и я был очень счастлив. Вы понимаете, я был очень влюблен в нее. Возможно, из-за окружающей ее тайны. Нет-нет, это не так! Я любил эту женщину. Меня беспокоила тайна, это правда. Это меня разозлило ».\n\n- Итак, вы открыли ответ на загадку? Я плакал.\n\n«В некотором смысле», - ответил он. «В понедельник я обедал с дядей в его доме в Риджентс-парке. После обеда мне захотелось поупражняться, и я решил прогуляться до Пикадилли. Самый короткий путь - через множество бедных улочек. Я шел по одной из них, когда внезапно увидел перед собой леди Алрой. Ее лицо было наполовину скрыто большой шляпой, но у меня не было сомнений.\n\n«Она шла быстро. Подойдя к последнему дому на улице, она поднялась по ступенькам к входной двери, достала из сумки ключ, отперла дверь и вошла.\n\n«Так вот в чем загадка», - сказал я себе и поспешил к дому. Казалось, это место, где люди могут снимать комнаты.\n\n«Она уронила носовой платок, когда достала ключ из сумки. Он лежал на пороге, я поднял его и положил в карман.\n\n«В шесть часов я пошел к ней, как мы и договорились. Она лежала на диване в серебристом платье и выглядела очень мило.\n\nЯ так рада тебя видеть », - сказала она. «Я не гулял весь день».\n\nЯ очень удивленно уставился на нее. Я вытащил из кармана платок и протянул ей. «Вы сбросили это сегодня днем ​​на Канмор-стрит, леди Алрой», - сказал я очень спокойно.\n\nОна с ужасом посмотрела на меня, но платка не взяла.\n\n«Что вы там делали»? Я спросил.\n\n«Какое право ты имеешь спрашивать меня»? она ответила.\n\n«Право человека, который любит тебя», - сказал я. «Я пришел сюда, чтобы попросить тебя стать моей женой».\n\nОна закрыла лицо руками, но я видел, как из ее глаз текут слезы.\n\n«Вы должны сказать мне, - продолжил я.\n\nОна встала и сквозь слезы посмотрела мне прямо в глаза. «Лорд Мерчисон», - сказала она. «Нечего тебе сказать».\n\n«Вы пошли встретить кого-то»! Я плакал. «Это твоя загадка».\n\n«Ее лицо ужасно побелело, и она сказала:« Я ни с кем не ходила ».\n\n«Это неправда», - сказал я.\n\n«Это правда», - ответила она.\n\n«Я был в ярости - полностью потерял контроль. Не знаю, что я сказал, но я сказал ей ужасные вещи. Наконец я выбежал из дома. На следующий день она написала мне письмо, но я отправил его нераспечатанным и уехал в Норвегию с моим другом Аланом Колвиллом.\n\n«Проведя месяц в Норвегии, я вернулся в Лондон. Вернувшись, я увидел в газете «Морнинг пост» сообщение о смерти леди Алрой. Однажды вечером она сильно простудилась в театре и умерла через несколько дней.\n\n«Я заперся в своих комнатах и ​​несколько дней никого не видел. Я так сильно и безумно любил ее. Бог! Я любил эту женщину!\n\n- Вы пошли на улицу - в дом в ней? Я сказал.\n\n«Да», - ответил он. «Однажды я пошел на Камнор-стрит. Мне надо было уйти. Сомнения разрушали мой разум. Я постучал в дверь, и мне открыла женщина с хорошей внешностью. Я спросил ее, есть ли у нее в аренду комнаты.\n\n«Что ж, сэр, - вежливо ответила она, - гостиная действительно занята, но я не видела эту даму уже три месяца. И арендная плата не оплачена, так что я думаю, что могу передать ее вам ».\n\n«Это леди»? - спросил я и показал ей фотографию.\n\n\"О да! Это ее\"! она сказала. «Когда она вернется, сэр»?\n\n«Дама мертва», - ответил я.\n\n\"О, Боже\"! сказала женщина. «Мне очень жаль это слышать. Она платила мне три фунта в неделю, а иногда просто приходила и сидела в моей гостиной ».\n\n«Она кого-то здесь встречала»? Я сказал.\n\n«Нет, сэр», - сказала женщина. \"Никогда. Она всегда приходила одна и никого не видела ».\n\n«Что она здесь делала»? Я плакал.\n\n«Она сидела в комнате, сэр, читала книги», - ответила женщина. «Иногда она пила чай, но всегда одна».\n\nЯ не знал, что сказать, поэтому дал женщине пять фунтов и пошел домой. Как вы думаете, что это значило? Как вы думаете, история женщины была правдой?\n\n«Да, знаю, - сказал я.\n\n- Тогда почему леди Алрой поехала туда?\n\n«Джеральд, - ответил я, - леди Алрой была просто женщиной, у которой должна была быть загадка. Она сняла комнату, чтобы попасть туда тайно. Она вообразила себя загадочным персонажем рассказа. Она очень любила тайны и загадки, но сама была просто сфинксом без секретов ».\n\n'Вы действительно так думаете'? он сказал.\n\n«Я уверен в этом», - сказал я.\n\nОн вынул кожаный футляр из кармана, открыл его и посмотрел на фотографию.\n\n«Я никогда не буду уверен», - сказал он наконец.",

        "en": "My name is Judith Lee and I am a teacher. I teach people who are deaf and dumb, and I teach them by lip-reading. When people say a word, they all move their lips the same way, so if you watch them carefully, you know what they are saying.\nMy father was one of the first people to teach lip-reading. My mother was deaf, but she could lip-read, so lip-reading has always been part of my life. And because I have always been able to do it, I was able to play a part in the adventure I am going to tell you about…\n\nI was thirteen years old when it happened. My mother and father were visiting another country, and I was staying in a small village, in a cottage which we owned. Mrs Dickson, our servant, was staying there with me.\n\nI was returning home by train one day, after a visit to some friends. There were two people sitting opposite me, a man and a woman. The woman got out at a station not far from my home. Then a man got in and sat beside the one who was already there. They seemed to know each other.\n\nThey talked quietly for some minutes, and it was impossible to hear what they said. But I only had to look at their faces. I was reading a magazine and looked up to see the first man say something which surprised me.\n‘…Myrtle Cottage. It’s got a large myrtle tree in the front garden.’\n\nThe other man said something in a low voice, but his face was turned away from me. The first man replied, and I read his lips again. ‘His name is Colegate, and he uses it as a summer cottage. He’s got some of the best old silver in England.’\n\nThe other man shook his head and turned so I could see his face. I saw him say: ‘Old silver is no better than new. You can only melt it.’\n\nThe first man’s face became red. ‘Only melt it! Don’t be stupid! I can sell old silver at good prices. And that silver in Myrtle Cottage must be worth more than a thousand pounds. There’s a silver salt-cellar worth at least a hundred.’\nThe other man looked at me while I was watching his friend speak. He had fair hair and blue eyes. ‘That child is watching us,’ he whispered. ‘Be careful.’\n\nThe look in those blue eyes began to frighten me.\nThe first man said, ‘Let her watch, she can’t hear us.’\n\nI was alone with them, and I was quite small. So I looked back at my magazine instead of watching the rest of their conversation. I knew Myrtle Cottage because it was not very far from our own cottage. And I knew Mr Colegate, and about his old silver. I knew the silver salt-cellar the two men spoke about, and wondered why they were interested in it. I was very young. I did not think: ‘These two men who speak in whispers may not be honest.’\nThey both got out at the station before our village.\n\nAfter tea that evening, I went for a walk without telling Mrs Dickson. My walk took me past Myrtle Cottage. It was small, and there were no other houses near it. I knew that Mr Colegate was away, but when I went into the garden, I saw that the front-room window was open. I looked inside. What I saw surprised me very much.\nIn the room was the first man from the train. All of Mr Colegate’s silver was on the table in front of him, and he was holding the silver salt-cellar. I did not know what to think. What was he doing there? What should I do? I was still trying to decide when a hand went round my throat.\n\n‘If you make a sound, I’ll kill you,’ said a man’s voice in my ear. ‘Believe me, I will!’\nIt was the other man, and he recognised me.\n‘It’s the girl from the train!’ he said.\n\nThe first man came to the window. ‘What’s happening?’ he asked. ‘Who’s that child you’re holding?’\nThe other man pushed my face forwards. ‘Can’t you see? I knew she was listening!’\n‘She couldn’t hear us on the train,’ said the first man. ‘Nobody could hear our whispers. Give her to me.’\nI was passed through the window, and now it was his hands that went round my throat. ‘Who are you?’ he wanted to know. ‘If you scream, I’ll pull your head right off you!’\nI did not move or speak.\n\n‘Cut her throat,’ said the other man, and took a long, terrible-looking knife with a silver handle from the table.\n‘Wait,’ said his friend. He took a piece of rope from his bag. Then they pushed me into a chair and tied the rope around my arms and legs. They also tied something across my mouth to stop me speaking.\n\nThe man with blue eyes moved towards me with the knife. I was sure he was going to cut my throat. But he took my long hair in one hand, and with that terrible knife he cut all of it from my head!\nI was more angry than I thought possible. I wanted to take that knife and push it into him! My long hair was more valuable to me than almost anything. Not because of my own love of it, but because my mother loved it. It pleased her so much, and she often told me how beautiful it was. And now this man had robbed me of it in the most terrible way. At that moment, I wanted to kill him.\n\nHe hit me across the face with my own hair. ‘It didn’t take me long to cut it off,’ he said, ‘but I’ll cut your throat quicker if you try to move.’\n\nThe man with blue eyes let my hair fall all over me. Then the two of them began to put Mr Colegate’s silver into two large bags. That was when I realized they were stealing it, and there was nothing I could do.\nThe man with blue eyes moved towards the window, carrying one of the bags. The first man put a hand on his arm, and I watched him whisper, ‘Do you remember the plan?’\n\nThe man with blue eyes put his mouth close to the other man’s ear. I watched his lips as he said, ‘Cotterill, Cloakroom, Victoria Station, Brighton Railway.’\n\nI knew the words were important and promised myself that I would not forget them.\nHe got out of the window and his bag was passed to him. He turned towards me and said, ‘Sorry I can’t take a piece of your hair. Perhaps I’ll come back for some later.’ Then he went, and anger burned inside me.\nHis friend did not look at me. He took his bag and went out through the door. I don’t know what happened to him afterwards. I was left alone, all through that night.\n\nI was not afraid, but the rope hurt my arms and legs. I repeated the words, ‘Cotterill, Cloakroom, Victoria Station Brighton Railway.’ I was sure they were important.\nI did not sleep that night. Day came, and I wondered what Mrs Dickson was doing. Was she looking for me? I had some friends who lived three or four miles away. Sometimes I stayed the night with them, without telling anyone at home. Did Mrs Dickson think I was with them?\n\nI do not know what time it was when I heard the sound of feet outside. The day seemed almost over. I watched the open window, and suddenly a face appeared.\nIt was Mr Colegate.\n‘Judith!’ he said. ‘Judith Lee!’\n\nHe was not a young man, but he climbed in through that window as quickly as a boy. He took a knife from his pocket and cut the rope around my arms and legs, then he uncovered my mouth and at last I could speak.\n‘Cotterill, Cloakroom, Victoria Station, Brighton Railway,’ I said. Then I fell into Mr Colegate’s arms.\n\nI knew no more until I woke up in bed with Mrs Dickson standing beside me. With her were Dr Scott, Mr Colegate, Pierce the village policeman, and another man. I discovered later that he was a detective.\nI saw that I was in a room in Myrtle Cottage, and sat up in bed — and remembered everything.\n‘He cut off my hair with the long knife!’ I said.\n\nMy head felt strange. I asked for a mirror, then became angry again when I saw the blue-eyed man’s work. Before anyone could stop me, I jumped out of bed.\n\n‘Cotterill, Cloakroom, Victoria Station, Brighton Railway,’ I said. ‘Where are my clothes?’\nAt first they thought I was crazy. But then I told them my story. ‘Cotterill, Cloakroom, Victoria Station, Brighton Railway,’ I said again. ‘That’s where I’m gong to catch the man who cut off my hair. And if we don’t go quickly, we may be too late.’\n\nMr Colegate agreed. He wanted to get his silver back as much as I wanted to find the man who cut my hair. So we went up to London on the first train that we could catch — Mr Colegate, the detective, and an almost hairless child.\n\nWe got to Victoria Station and went to the cloakroom.\n‘Is there a parcel here in the name of Cotterill?’ Asked the detective.\n‘One in the name of Cotterill was taken only half a minute ago,’ the cloakroom man replied. ‘Didn’t you see him walking off with it?’ He looked along the station. ‘There he is! Someone’s going to speak to him.’\nI saw a man carrying a parcel, and I saw the man who was going to speak to him. ‘It’s the man who cut my hair!’ I shouted, and ran towards him as fast as I could go. He looked round and saw me, and quickly realized who I was. He whispered to the man with the parcel before running away.\n\nI saw clearly what he said. ‘Bantock, 13 Harwood Street, near Oxford Street.’ Those were the words. And then he turned and ran away. Mr Colegate and the detective were close behind me. The man with the parcel saw us, and at once he dropped the parcel and ran off.\n\nWe did no catch him, or the man who cut my hair. The station was full of people coming off a train, which made it easy for both men to escape. But we got the parcel. It was not big enough to contain Mr Colegate’s silver, we realized that. But it did contain a much bigger surprise.\nJewels!\n\nA London detective was sent for. He looked at the jewels and said, ‘These are the Duchess of Dachet’s jewels. The police all over Europe are looking for them.’\n\nThe man from the cloakroom was with us. ‘That parcel has been with us for nearly a month,’ he said. ‘The person who took it out paid for twenty-seven days.’\n\n‘I wish I could catch him,’ said the London detective. ‘I have a word or two that I want to say to him.’\n‘I think I know where you can find him,’ I said. ‘Bantock, 13 Harwood Street, near Oxford Street.’\n‘Who is Bantock?’ the detective asked.\n\n‘I don’t know,’ I said. ‘But I saw the man who cut off my hair whisper those words before he ran away.’\n‘You saw him whisper them?’ The London detective looked at the others. ‘What does she mean? Young lady, you were fifteen metres away. How could you hear him whisper?’\n\n‘I didn’t say I heard him whisper,’ I replied. ‘I said I saw him. I don’t need to hear to know what a person is saying.’\n‘Judith is an excellent lip-reader,’ said Mr Colegate. He explained, but the others found it hard to believe.\n‘So what did you see him whisper?’ asked the detective.\n\n‘I’ll tell you if I can come with you,’ I said.\nThe detective laughed. He seemed to think that I was amusing, but I don’t know why. He did not understand how angry I was about my hair. ‘All right,’ he said. ‘You can come. Now, tell me what you saw him whisper.’\nSo I told him again and he wrote it down.\n\n‘I know Harwood Street, but I don’t know Mr Bantock,’ he said. ‘First I’ll send a message for some help, then we’ll go and visit Mr Bantock — if there is a Mr Bantock.’\nThe four of us went in a taxi — the two detectives, Mr Colegate and I. After a while, the taxi stopped on the corner of a street.\n\n‘This is Harwood Street,’ said the London detective. ‘We can walk the rest of the way. We don’t want to stop outside the door. They may guess who we are.’\nIt was a street full of shops. The shop at number 13 sold jewels and other less valuable things. The name ‘Bantock was over the top of the window.\n\nAs we reached the shop, a taxi stopped outside it and five men got out. The London detective recognized them and did not look pleased. ‘Now our visit won’t be a surprise,’ he said. ‘Come on, let’s go in quickly.’\nAnd we went in, the detective first and me behind him. There were two young men standing close together at the other side of the shop. When they saw us, I saw one whisper, ‘They’re detectives! Ring the alarm bell!’\n\n‘He’s going to ring the alarm bell!’ I shouted.\nThe men from the other taxi were also detectives.\nThey came in quickly and held each of the two young men.\nThere was a door at the end of the shop which the London detective opened. ‘Stairs,’ he said. ‘We’ll go up. You men wait here until you’re wanted.’\n\nI followed him up the stairs. At the top were two more doors. I could hear voices coming from behind one of them. The London detective went towards it. He opened the door and went in, and I was close behind him. There were several men in there, but I was only interested in one. He was standing on the other side of a table.\n‘That’s the man who cut off my hair!’ I cried.\nHe seemed at first like a man who had seen a ghost, but then he said, ‘I wish I had cut your throat!’\n\nThe police caught all the thieves. They were wanted all over the world for other robberies. Mr Colegate got his silver back. Mr Bantock, who owned the shop, was someone who bought and sold stolen jewels. He and all the other men in that room were sent to prison.\n\nIt took many years for my hair to grow long again, and it never grew as long as before. Each time I looked into a mirror, some of my anger returned.\nBut the man who cut my hair was stupid. Before he cut it, the rope hurt me badly and I wasn’t interested in what he and his friend were doing or saying. But after he cut it, I was very angry indeed, and so I watched every move which they — and their lips! — made!",

Миссис Диксон, наша служанка, жила там со мной.\n\nОднажды я возвращался домой поездом после визита к друзьям. Напротив меня сидели два человека, мужчина и женщина. Женщина вышла на станции недалеко от моего дома. Затем вошел мужчина и сел рядом с тем, кто уже был там. Казалось, они знают друг друга.\n\nНесколько минут они говорили тихо, и было невозможно услышать, что они говорили. Но мне нужно было только взглянуть на их лица. Я читал журнал и, подняв голову, увидел, что первый мужчина сказал что-то, что меня удивило.\n«… Миртл-Коттедж. В палисаднике растет большое миртовое дерево.\n\nДругой мужчина что-то сказал тихим голосом, но его лицо было отвернуто от меня. Первый мужчина ответил, и я снова прочитал его губы. «Его зовут Колегейт, и он использует его как дачу. У него одно из лучших старых серебра в Англии.\n\nДругой мужчина покачал головой и повернулся, чтобы я могла видеть его лицо. Я видел, как он сказал: «Старое серебро не лучше нового. Его можно только растопить ».\n\nЛицо первого человека покраснело. «Только растопи! Не будь дураком! Я могу продать старое серебро по хорошей цене. И это серебро в Миртл-Коттедж, должно быть, стоит больше тысячи фунтов. Есть серебряная солонка не меньше сотни.\nДругой мужчина посмотрел на меня, пока я смотрел, как говорит его друг. У него были светлые волосы и голубые глаза. «Этот ребенок наблюдает за нами», - прошептал он. 'Быть осторожен'.\n\nВзгляд этих голубых глаз начал меня пугать.\nПервый мужчина сказал: «Пусть смотрит, она нас не слышит».\n\nЯ был с ними наедине, и я был совсем маленьким. Поэтому я снова посмотрел на свой журнал, вместо того, чтобы следить за их разговором. Я знал Коттедж Миртл, потому что он был недалеко от нашего коттеджа. И я знал мистера Колегейта и его старое серебро. Я знал серебряную солонку, о которой говорили двое мужчин, и задавался вопросом, почему им это интересно. Я был очень молод. Я не думал: «Эти двое мужчин, которые говорят шепотом, могут быть нечестными».\nОба вышли на вокзале перед нашей деревней.\n\nВ тот вечер после чая я пошел прогуляться, не сказав миссис Диксон. Моя прогулка привела меня к Коттеджу Миртл. Он был маленьким, и других домов рядом с ним не было. Я знал, что мистера Колегейта нет, но когда я вышел в сад, то увидел, что окно в передней было открыто. Я заглянул внутрь. То, что я увидел, меня очень удивило.\nВ комнате был первый мужчина из поезда. Все серебро мистера Колегейта лежало на столе перед ним, и он держал серебряную солонку. Я не знал, что думать. Что он там делал? Что я должен делать? Я все еще пытался решить, когда чья-то рука обхватила мое горло.\n\n«Если ты издашь звук, я убью тебя», - сказал мне в ухо мужской голос. «Поверьте, я буду»!\nЭто был другой мужчина, и он узнал меня.\n«Это девушка из поезда»! он сказал.\n\nПервый мужчина подошел к окну. 'Что происходит'? он спросил. «Кто этот ребенок, которого вы держите»?\nДругой мужчина толкнул меня вперед. «Разве ты не видишь? Я знал, что она слушает!\n«Она не слышала нас в поезде», - сказал первый мужчина. «Никто не мог слышать наш шепот. Отдай ее мне ».\nМеня пропустили через окно, и теперь его руки обвились вокруг моего горла. 'Кто ты'? он хотел знать. «Если ты закричишь, я тебе голову оторву»!\nЯ не двигался и не говорил.\n\n«Перережь ей горло», - сказал тот и взял со стола длинный ужасного вида нож с серебряной ручкой.\n«Подождите, - сказал его друг. Он достал из сумки кусок веревки. Затем они затолкали меня в кресло и обвязали веревкой мои руки и ноги. Они также что-то привязали ко рту, чтобы я не могла говорить.\n\nМужчина с голубыми глазами двинулся ко мне с ножом. Я был уверен, что он собирался перерезать мне горло. Но он взял мои длинные волосы одной рукой и этим ужасным ножом срезал их с моей головы!\nЯ был зол больше, чем я думал. Я хотел взять этот нож и воткнуть в него! Мои длинные волосы были для меня ценнее всего. Не из-за моей любви к нему, а потому, что это нравилось моей матери. Это ей так нравилось, и она часто рассказывала мне, как это красиво. А теперь этот человек отнял у меня его самым ужасным образом. В тот момент я хотел его убить.\n\nОн ударил меня по лицу собственными волосами. «Мне не потребовалось много времени, чтобы отрезать его, - сказал он, - но я перережу тебе горло быстрее, если ты попытаешься пошевелиться».\n\nМужчина с голубыми глазами позволил моим волосам упасть на меня. Затем они вдвоем стали складывать серебро мистера Колегейта в два больших мешка. Именно тогда я понял, что они воруют, и я ничего не мог поделать.\nМужчина с голубыми глазами двинулся к окну, неся одну из сумок. Первый мужчина положил руку ему на плечо, и я увидел, как он прошептал: «Ты помнишь план»?\n\nМужчина с голубыми глазами приложил рот к уху другого мужчины. Я наблюдал за его губами, когда он сказал: «Коттерилл, раздевалка, вокзал Виктория, Брайтонская железная дорога».\n\nЯ знал, что эти слова важны, и пообещал себе, что не забуду их.\nОн вылез из окна, и ему передали сумку. Он повернулся ко мне и сказал: «Извини, я не могу оторвать кусок твоих волос. Возможно, я вернусь за чем-нибудь позже ». Потом он ушел, и во мне загорелся гнев.\nЕго друг не смотрел на меня. Он взял сумку и вышел через дверь. Я не знаю, что с ним случилось потом. Я был один на всю ночь.\n\nЯ не боялся, но веревка повредила руки и ноги. Я повторил слова: «Коттерилл, раздевалка, вокзал Виктория, Брайтонская железная дорога». Я был уверен, что они важны.\nВ ту ночь я не спал. Настал день, и мне стало интересно, что делает миссис Диксон. Она меня искала? У меня были друзья, которые жили в трех или четырех милях от нас. Иногда я ночевал у них, никому дома не сказав. Миссис Диксон думала, что я был с ними?\n\nЯ не знаю, во сколько это было, когда я услышал звук шагов снаружи. День казался почти законченным. Я смотрел в открытое окно, и внезапно появилось лицо.\nЭто был мистер Колегейт.\n'Джудит'! он сказал. «Джудит Ли»!\n\nОн не был молодым человеком, но влез в это окно так же быстро, как мальчик. Он вынул из кармана нож и перерезал веревку вокруг моих рук и ног, затем открыл мне рот, и, наконец, я смог говорить.\n- Коттерилл, раздевалка, вокзал Виктория, Брайтонская железная дорога, - сказал я. Затем я упал в объятия мистера Колегейта.\n\nЯ ничего не знал, пока не проснулся в постели, а рядом со мной стояла миссис Диксон. С ней были доктор Скотт, мистер Колегейт, деревенский полицейский Пирс и еще один мужчина. Позже я узнал, что он был детективом.\nЯ увидел, что нахожусь в комнате в Миртл-коттедже, сел в постели - и все вспомнил.\n- Он отрезал мне волосы длинным ножом! Я сказал.\n\nВ голове было странно. Я попросил зеркало и снова рассердился, когда увидел работу голубоглазого человека. Прежде чем кто-либо смог меня остановить, я вскочил с кровати.\n\n- Коттерилл, раздевалка, вокзал Виктория, Брайтонская железная дорога, - сказал я. «Где моя одежда»?\nСначала они подумали, что я сошел с ума. Но потом я рассказал им свою историю. - Коттерилл, раздевалка, вокзал Виктория, Брайтонская железная дорога, - повторил я. «Вот где я собираюсь поймать человека, который отрезал мне волосы. И если мы не пойдем быстро, мы можем опоздать ».\n\nМистер Колегейт согласился. Он хотел вернуть свое серебро так же сильно, как я хотел найти человека, который стриг мне волосы. Итак, мы поехали в Лондон на первом же поезде, на котором смогли успеть - мистер Колегейт, детектив и почти лысый ребенок.\n\nWe got to Victoria Station and went to the cloakroom.\n‘Is there a parcel here in the name of Cotterill?’ Asked the detective.\n‘One in the name of Cotterill was taken only half a minute ago,’ the cloakroom man replied. ‘Didn’t you see him walking off with it?’ He looked along the station. ‘There he is! Someone’s going to speak to him.’\nI saw a man carrying a parcel, and I saw the man who was going to speak to him. ‘It’s the man who cut my hair!’ I shouted, and ran towards him as fast as I could go. He looked round and saw me, and quickly realized who I was. He whispered to the man with the parcel before running away.\n\nЯ ясно видел, что он сказал. «Банток, Харвуд-стрит, 13, недалеко от Оксфорд-стрит». Это были слова. А потом он повернулся и убежал. Мистер Колегейт и детектив были рядом со мной. Человек с посылкой увидел нас, сразу бросил посылку и убежал.\n\nМы не поймали ни его, ни человека, который стриг мне волосы. Станция была заполнена людьми, выходящими из поезда, что позволило обоим мужчинам легко сбежать. Но мы получили посылку. Мы понимали, что он не был достаточно большим, чтобы вместить серебро мистера Колегейта. Но он содержал гораздо больший сюрприз.\nДрагоценности!\n\nПослали за лондонским детективом. Он посмотрел на драгоценности и сказал: «Это драгоценности герцогини Даше. Их ищет полиция по всей Европе ».\n\nС нами был мужчина из раздевалки. «Эта посылка была у нас почти месяц», - сказал он. «Тот, кто его достал, заплатил двадцать семь дней».\n\n«Хотел бы я его поймать, - сказал лондонский детектив. «Я хочу сказать ему пару слов».\n«Думаю, я знаю, где его найти, - сказал я. «Банток, Харвуд-стрит, 13, недалеко от Оксфорд-стрит».\n\"Кто такой Банток\"? - спросил детектив.\n\n«Не знаю», - сказал я. «Но я видел, как мужчина, отрезавший мне волосы, прошептал эти слова, прежде чем убежал».\n- Вы видели, как он их шептал? Лондонский детектив посмотрел на остальных. Что она имеет в виду? Юная леди, вы были в пятнадцати метрах. Как вы могли слышать его шепот?\n\n«Я не говорил, что слышал его шепот», - ответил я. «Я сказал, что видел его. Мне не нужно слышать, чтобы знать, что говорит человек ».\n«Джудит отлично читает по губам, - сказал мистер Колегейт. Он объяснил, но другим было трудно поверить.\n- Так что вы видели, как он шептал? - спросил детектив.\n\n«Я скажу тебе, смогу ли я пойти с тобой», - сказал я.\nДетектив рассмеялся. Похоже, он думал, что я забавляю, но я не знаю почему. Он не понимал, как я зол на свои волосы. «Хорошо, - сказал он. 'Ты можешь придти. А теперь расскажи мне, что ты видел, как он шептал?\nЯ сказал ему еще раз, и он записал.\n\n«Я знаю Харвуд-стрит, но не знаю мистера Бантока», - сказал он. «Сначала я пришлю сообщение с просьбой о помощи, а затем мы пойдем навестить мистера Бантока - если есть мистер Банток».\nМы вчетвером поехали в такси - двое детективов, мистер Колегейт и я. Через некоторое время такси остановилось на углу улицы.\n\n«Это Харвуд-стрит, - сказал лондонский детектив. «Мы можем пройти остаток пути. Мы не хотим останавливаться за дверью. Они могут догадаться, кто мы ».\nЭто была улица, полная магазинов. В магазине под номером 13 продавались драгоценности и другие менее ценные вещи. Имя «Банток» было над окном.\n\nКогда мы подошли к магазину, возле него остановилось такси, из которого вышли пятеро мужчин. Лондонский детектив узнал их и выглядел недовольным. «Теперь наш визит не станет сюрпризом», - сказал он. «Пойдем, пойдем побыстрее».\nИ мы вошли, детектив первым, а я за ним. На другом конце магазина рядом стояли двое молодых людей. Когда они нас увидели, я услышал один шепот: «Детективы! Звоните в колокол!\n\n«Он собирается бить тревогу»! Я закричал.\nЛюди из другого такси тоже были детективами.\nОни быстро вошли и схватили каждого из двух молодых людей.\nВ конце магазина была дверь, которую открыл лондонский детектив. «Лестница», - сказал он. «Мы пойдем. Вы, мужчины, ждите здесь, пока вас не разыщут.\n\nЯ последовал за ним по лестнице. Наверху были еще две двери. Я слышал голоса позади одного из них. Лондонский детектив пошел навстречу. Он открыл дверь и вошел, а я был рядом с ним. Там было несколько мужчин, но меня интересовал только один. Он стоял по другую сторону стола.\n«Это тот человек, который отрезал мне волосы»! Я плакал.\nСначала он казался человеком, увидевшим привидение, но затем сказал: «Хотел бы я перерезать тебе горло»!\n\nПолиция поймала всех воров. Их разыскивали во всем мире за другие ограбления. Мистер Колегейт получил обратно свое серебро. Мистер Банток, владелец магазина, покупал и продавал украденные драгоценности. Он и все остальные мужчины в этой комнате были отправлены в тюрьму.\n\nМне потребовалось много лет, чтобы мои волосы снова стали длинными, и никогда не росли так долго, как раньше. Каждый раз, когда я смотрел в зеркало, моя злость возвращалась.\nНо человек, который стриг мне волосы, был глуп. Прежде чем он перерезал ее, веревка сильно повредила мне, и меня не интересовало, что он и его друг делают или говорят. Но после того, как он разрезал его, я действительно был очень зол, и поэтому я наблюдал за каждым их движением - и их губами! - сделал!",

        "lev": "B",
        "en": "It is impossible to say when Charles Darrell and Sonia French first decided to murder Sonia’s husband, Robert. Robert was nearly twice as old as Sonia, and he married her ten years before Charles Darrell came into her life. For eight of those years, Sonia was bored with her husband, although he did not seem to realize this. He was more interested in his books, and the silver which he bought.\n\nSonia and Charles were lovers for six months before things became difficult. People were beginning to talk, and it could not be long before Robert found out about them. ‘Robert will never give me a divorce,’ thought Sonia. ‘And Charles and I have no money of our own.’ But Sonia knew that Robert’s silver alone was worth enough money to make life very comfortable for her and Charles.\n\nBy a strange accident, it was a policeman who gave them the idea for their murder plan. The inspector made a surprise visit to the Frenches’ house one evening. Charles was also there. He often came in for a drink.\n‘There have been several burglaries near here,’ the inspector told Robert, ‘and we haven’t caught the burglar. We know who he is, and it can’t be long before we catch him, but we’re very worried. He carries a gun, and we’re almost sure he has killed a man. Now this house is in a very lonely place. Mr Darrell is your only neighbour. You also have a lot of valuable silver.’\n\n‘What are you trying to say? Asked Robert.\n‘I’m saying that it’s sensible to be careful,’ said the inspector. ‘Very careful. Why not put your silver in the bank, until the burglar is caught?’\n‘I don’t want to do that,’ said Robert.\nThe inspector tried not to sound angry. ‘Well, I have warned you, sir,’ he said. ‘Please remember that.’\n\nThe inspector left, and Charles said, ‘The inspector didn’t warn me. He knows I’ve got nothing worth stealing. But if this gunman does visit me, he’ll be sorry. I have a gun, and I won’t think twice before using it.’\nHe was tall and strong, and Sonia thought he was very good-looking. And she did not try to hide her feelings.\n‘I feel sorry for the burglar who tries to frighten you, Charles,’ she said.\n\nThree nights later, Sonia was lying awake in her bed. Robert was asleep. It was ten minutes to two.\nSonia was excited. ‘Ten minutes before Charles enters the house,’ she thought. It was ten long minutes.\nAnd then she heard a noise. Glass breaking, followed by the sound of a window as it was pushed up.\nRobert did not wake up. Sonia waited until she heard the sound of Charles climbing through the open window, then she reached across to Robert’s bed.\n\n‘Robert!’ She was shaking him. ‘Wake up. There’s somebody downstairs!’\nRobert woke slowly. ‘What? Someone downstairs? No, I’m sure you’re -’ He sat up, awake now. ‘There is someone! I’ll have to go down, I suppose.’\n\nHe put on his old grey dressing-gown, and went out of the room. Sonia waited in the dark. It seemed a very long wait, but it was less than half a minute. Then a thin line of light appeared under the bedroom door. Sonia heard her husband give a sudden cry, then she heard a gun explode. Something — or someone — heavy fell to the floor, then a door was banged open, and there was the sound of running feet outside the house.\n\nSonia waited. ‘Charles must have time to escape before I call the police,’ she thought.\nShe put on her bedside light and got out of bed. Now it was all over, she felt strangely calm. She knew what she was going to say to the police. How soon could she marry Charles? Six months from now? They could go to Venice for a holiday, after they were married. She had always wanted to see Venice…\n\nThen the door opened.\nAnd Robert walked in.\nFor a long moment, Sonia could only look at him, her stomach sick with fear. He looked back at her, silent, white-faced and untidy. But alive.\n\n‘What — what happened?’ she said.\n‘He got away,’ said Robert. ‘I’m afraid he’s taken some of my best silver with him. I wish now I had listened to the inspector and sent it to the bank.’\n‘But I heard a gun,’ said Sonia. ‘I thought you — you’re not hurt, Robert?’\n‘No, Sonia, I’m not hurt,’ said Robert. ‘But I have some bad news. It’s Charles. I think the dear, brave man was watching the house, and followed the burglar in, to try and help us. He’s at the bottom of the stairs. I’m afraid there is nothing that we can do for him.’\n\nSonia fell forwards, her eyes closing, and Robert caught her. He carried her to the bed, then went downstairs. When he reached the bottom, he had to step over the body. He did this calmly, stepping around the blood on the carpet. But when he walked into the room where he kept his silver, he wanted to cry. All of the best pieces were gone.\n\nHe closed the door and went into his study. But before he telephoned the police, he was careful to clean the small gun that was in his dressing-gown pocket. Then he locked it inside his desk. He had taken care of the one problem in his usually very tidy life, and he wanted to make sure he would have no more trouble.\n\nAs the inspector said, it was sensible to be careful.",
        "ru": "Невозможно сказать, когда Чарльз Даррелл и Соня Френч впервые решили убить мужа Сони Роберта. Роберт был почти вдвое старше Сони и женился на ней за десять лет до того, как Чарльз Даррелл вошел в ее жизнь. Восемь из этих лет Соне было скучно с мужем, хотя он, казалось, не осознавал этого. Его больше интересовали его книги и серебро, которое он покупал.\n\nСоня и Чарльз были любовниками шесть месяцев, пока все не стало трудным. Люди начали говорить, и вскоре Роберт узнал о них. «Роберт никогда не даст мне развода», - подумала Соня. - А у нас с Чарльзом собственных денег нет. Но Соня знала, что одно только серебро Роберта стоило достаточно денег, чтобы сделать жизнь очень комфортной для нее и Чарльза.\n\nПо странной случайности идею их плана убийства подал полицейский. Однажды вечером инспектор неожиданно посетил дом Френча. Чарльз тоже был там. Он часто заходил выпить.\n«Здесь было несколько краж со взломом, - сказал инспектор Роберту, - и мы не поймали грабителя. Мы знаем, кто он, и скоро поймем его, но мы очень обеспокоены. У него пистолет, и мы почти уверены, что он убил человека. Сейчас этот дом находится в очень уединенном месте. Мистер Даррелл - ваш единственный сосед. А еще у тебя много драгоценного серебра ».\n\n'Что ты пытаешься сказать? - спросил Роберт.\n«Я говорю, что нужно быть осторожным», - сказал инспектор. 'Очень осторожно. Почему бы не положить свое серебро в банк, пока грабитель не пойман?\n«Я не хочу этого делать, - сказал Роберт.\nИнспектор старался не рассердиться. «Что ж, я предупреждал вас, сэр», - сказал он. «Пожалуйста, запомните это».\n\nИнспектор ушел, а Чарльз сказал: «Инспектор меня не предупреждал. Он знает, что у меня нет ничего стоящего воровства. Но если этот боевик навестит меня, он пожалеет. У меня есть пистолет, и я не буду дважды думать, прежде чем использовать его ».\nОн был высоким и сильным, и Соня считала его очень красивым. И она не пыталась скрыть свои чувства.\n«Мне жаль грабителя, который пытается напугать тебя, Чарльз, - сказала она.\n\nТри ночи спустя Соня не спала в постели. Роберт спал. Было без десяти два.\nСоня была взволнована. «За десять минут до того, как Чарльз войдет в дом», - подумала она. Это было десять долгих минут.\nА потом она услышала шум. Стекло разбилось, а затем раздался звук открывающегося окна.\nРоберт не проснулся. Соня подождала, пока не услышала звук Чарльза, пробирающегося через открытое окно, затем потянулась к кровати Роберта.\n\n'Роберт'! Она его трясла. 'Проснуться. Внизу кто-то есть!\nРоберт медленно просыпался. 'Какие? Кто-то внизу? Нет, я уверен, что вы - Он сел, проснувшись. 'Есть кто-то! Полагаю, мне придется спуститься.\n\nОн надел свой старый серый халат и вышел из комнаты. Соня ждала в темноте. Ожидание казалось очень долгим, но длилось меньше получаса. Затем из-под двери спальни появилась тонкая полоска света. Соня услышала, как ее муж внезапно вскрикнул, потом она услышала взрыв пистолета. Что-то - или кто-то - тяжелое упало на пол, затем дверь распахнулась, и за домом послышались шаги.\n\nСоня ждала. «У Чарльза должно быть время сбежать, прежде чем я позвоню в полицию», - подумала она.\nОна включила прикроватную лампу и встала с постели. Теперь все было кончено, она чувствовала себя странно спокойной. Она знала, что собиралась сказать полиции. Как скоро она сможет выйти за Чарльза? Через шесть месяцев? После свадьбы они могли поехать в Венецию на отдых. Ей всегда хотелось увидеть Венецию ...\n\nЗатем дверь открылась.\nИ Роберт вошел.\nДолгое время Соня могла только смотреть на него, ее живот болел от страха. Он посмотрел на нее, молчаливый, бледный и неопрятный. Но жив.\n\n- Что, что случилось? она сказала.\n«Он сбежал, - сказал Роберт. «Боюсь, он взял с собой часть моего лучшего серебра. Жаль, что теперь я не послушал инспектора и отправил его в банк ».\n«Но я слышала пистолет», - сказала Соня. - Я думал, ты, ты не ранен, Роберт?\n«Нет, Соня, я не ранен», - сказал Роберт. «Но у меня плохие новости. Это Чарльз. Я думаю, этот милый, храбрый человек наблюдал за домом и последовал за грабителем, чтобы попытаться помочь нам. Он внизу лестницы. Боюсь, мы ничего не можем для него сделать ».\n\nСоня упала вперед, закрыв глаза, и Роберт поймал ее. Он отнес ее к кровати и спустился вниз. Когда он достиг дна, ему пришлось перешагнуть через тело. Он делал это спокойно, обходя кровь на ковре. Но когда он вошел в комнату, где хранил свое серебро, ему захотелось плакать. Все лучшие работы пропали.\n\nОн закрыл дверь и вошел в свой кабинет. Но прежде чем позвонить в полицию, он тщательно очистил небольшой пистолет, который был в кармане халата. Затем он запер его в своем столе. Он решил одну проблему в своей обычно очень аккуратной жизни, и он хотел убедиться, что у него больше не будет проблем.\n\nКак сказал инспектор, было разумно быть осторожным.",

        "en": "There once lived an old man on the shore of a beautiful sea. All day he wove nets and caught fish. There were so many that the old fisherman shared them with his animals. He had a nice dog and an evil black cat. The dog was called Boley and the cat was called Serzhina.\n\n“Boley”! shouted the old man to his dog and it came at once.\n\n“Boley, bring me some water because I’m thirsty”!\n\nThe dog dashed away and in a little while came back with the water.\n\n“Here’s a fish for you,” the old man said as he stroked him.\n\n“Serzhina”!shouted the old fisherman to his cat this time, but Serzhina didn’t appear.\n\n“Serzhina! Serzhina”! he shouted again, but again nothing happened.\n\n“Serzhina, do you want a fish”?!\n\nAs soon as the old man said these words, the cat jumped from the roof and mewled around his legs with a phony purr.\n\n“I want a fish. Meow, meow”…\n\n“Here is your fish. Now bring me my hat, because I’m getting hot”.\n\nThe cat took the fish and then jumped on the hat rack and brought the old fisherman the hat.\n\n“Black cat, evil cat,” yelped the dog.\n\n“Don’t say that”! the old man scolded him.\n\nThe next day the old fisherman got sick. He had a high temperature and couldn’t get out of bed.\n\n“Boley, bring me a pill from the cabinet,” he said.\n\nThe dog tried to jump on the cabinet where the pills were, but he couldn’t reach it.\n\n“Serzhina”!called the old man, but the cat didn’t  appear.\n\n“Serzhina! Serzhina”! he shouted again, but again nothing happened.\n\n“Serzhina, do you want a fish”?!\n\nAs soon as the old man said these words, the cat jumped from the roof and mewled,\n\n“Meow, meow…I want a fish”.\n\n“Serzhina, I can’t go fishing today because I’m sick. When I get better, there’ll be enough for everyone. Hurry, Serzhina, bring me the pill from the cabinet”.\n\nThe cat jumped on the cabinet, but instead of bringing the pill to the old man she purred again,\n\n“I want a fish. Meow, meow”…\n\n“Serzhina, please, bring me the pill; otherwise, I won’t be able to get up,” sadly repeated the old man, but the cat didn’t budge.\n\nThe poor old man didn’t know what to do and began to cry from anguish.\n\nAll at once the dog yelped,\n\n“Woof, woof, woof”…\n\nThe old man turned toward Boley and saw a pill on the ground,\n\n“For sure it accidentally fell,” he thought to himself and looked toward the shelf where Serzhina was.\n\nThe dog brought the pill to the old fisherman and a little while later his temperature began to fall.\n\nWhen the old man woke up the next morning, he was healthy again. He impatiently threw the net into the sea and caught a lot of fish. He sat down on his chair in front of the house and watched the waves with his pipe in his hand.\n\n“Master, this cat will be our undoing! Let’s drive her away! Black cat, evil cat”! yelped the dog.\n\n“May it never be! You’ll see that Serzhina will change and will become good”.\n\n“Master, do you remember that you said the same thing about her mother. That cursed black Isolda, who tore up your nets every night while she was alive”?\n\n“Boley, we have to believe in the power of good. You’ll see. One day Serzhina will change and will become good”.\n\nThe old fisherman drew on his pipe and became lost in thought but not for long because the dog again said,\n\n“Master, aren’t we going to have breakfast”?\n\n“Do you want a fish”?\n\n“Woof, woof”! barked the dog with his tongue lolling out. The old man threw him a few large mackerels and patted him on the neck.\n\nJust then the hungry Serzhina jumped off the roof.\n\n“Meow, meow, I want a fish”.\n\nThe old man threw her a fish and then said,\n\n“Please, Serzhina, don’t act that way again”.\n\nThe cat purred and continued to rub against the old fisherman’s hand while he slept peacefully on the chair.\n\nUnfortunately, when he woke up, the old man saw that the thatched roof of his house was burning.\n\n“Boley, Serzhina, help me! Bring water from the sea! Hurry”!\n\nThe dog dashed off, but the cat didn’t budge. The old man threw her a fish and she ran to the water, but after a while she fell asleep. The old fisherman threw another fish to the black cat, and once again she began to help put out the fire but only for a short while. A little later the fish ran out and Serzhina went to sleep again. The dog kept on until he was exhausted, but the fire covered the whole house.\n\nThe poor old man wept because he had been left without a home.\n\n“Enough! I can’t take any more! Black cat, evil cat”! he raged. Then he grabbed Serzhina and angrily threw her into the sea.\n\nFinally, the old man had escaped from the black cat; however, the sea grew black.\n\nA few minutes later, a small black kitten with a crooked tail turned up beside the burned cottage.\n\n“Shoo! Shoo! Get away from here! No more black cats”! angrily said the old fisherman and chased the kitten away.\n\n“Master, I hope, that you finally have some sense in your head,” yelped Boley.\n\n“Boley, should we hurry up and build the house anew? What do you say”? enthusiastically suggested the old man.\n\n“Woof, woof… but first let’s eat. I’m hungry again”!\n\n“But the fish are all gone”. The old man scratched his head.\n\n“So let’s go fishing then”! suggested the dog.\n\n“Okay, Boley, bring the net”!\n\nUnfortunately however, when the old man threw the net into the black sea, he only caught a few small mackerels. The following day the same thing happened again only it was even worse. So day after day, the fish got less and less and the old man and the dog got hungrier and hungrier and the sea remained black.\n\nOne morning the poor old man refused to throw out the net, since for the past few days it had always been empty. He had become so desperate and weak from the scarce bits of food that he fell to his knees in the sand with hands out-stretched toward the sea,\n\n“Why”!?\n\nThe old man approached and Boley yelped,\n\n“It wanted to steal our last piece of fish”!\n\n“Because it’s hungry”.\n\n“Master, don’t you remember? Black cat, evil cat”! yelped the dog even more angrily.\n\n“No, Boley, it’s simply hungry like us. See how small and skinny it is”.\n\nEven though the dog continued to growl at the kitten, the old man divided the last fish into three pieces.\n\n“Here, Boley, this is for you. This is for me and that is for you, little one”.\n\nThe old fisherman gave the meat to the black kitten and started to pet it. Immediately the kitten became agitated and scratched him with its sharp claws.\n\n“Black cat, evil cat”! yelped Boley.\n\n“Don’t say that”! the old man scolded him. “It’s just scared because it doesn’t know us”.\n\nThe three of them ate the fish and watched the sea, but after a while the old fisherman again sadly said,\n\n“We don’t have anything else to eat. Now we’ll die from hunger”.\n\nThe dog whimpered sadly, but the little black kitten jumped up onto the burned roof. Just then the herring-gull said,\n\n“Throw the net into the sea”!\n\n“But it is black and there are no fish”! answered the old man.\n\nSince the bird didn’t say anything else, the old man decided to try. He threw the net into the sea and when he pulled it out, it was full to the top.\n\nAll of them were very happy and right before the gull flew away, it said,\n\n“Fisherman, remember one thing! A person without faith is like a net without fish! Once again you believe in goodness and once again your net is full”!\n\nDuring the following days with fresh energy from the plentiful food, the old fisherman rebuilt the cottage. He lived for a long time after that, but he never again lost his faith in goodness even though the sea remained black.",
        "ru": "Жил-был старик на берегу прекрасного моря. Целый день плел сети и ловил рыбу. Их было так много, что старый рыбак поделился ими со своими животными. У него была хорошая собака и злая черная кошка. Собаку звали Болей, а кошку - Сержина.\n\n\"Болей\"! крикнул старик своей собаке, и она немедленно кончила.\n\n«Боули, принеси мне воды, я хочу пить»!\n\nСобака бросилась прочь и через некоторое время вернулась с водой.\n\n«Вот тебе рыба», - сказал старик, гладя его.\n\n«Сержина»! - крикнул на этот раз старый рыбак своей кошке, но Сержина не появился.\n\n«Сержина! Сержина! » - крикнул он снова, но снова ничего не произошло.\n\n«Сержина, хочешь рыбу »?!\n\nКак только старик сказал эти слова, кот спрыгнул с крыши и мяукнул вокруг его ног с фальшивым мурлыканьем.\n\n«Я хочу рыбу. Мяу, мяу… »\n\n«Вот твоя рыба. А теперь принеси мою шляпу, мне становится жарко ».\n\nКот взял рыбу, запрыгнул на вешалку для шляп и принес шляпу старому рыбаку.\n\n«Черная кошка, злая кошка», - взвизгнула собака.\n\n«Не говори так»! Старик отругал его.\n\nНа следующий день старый рыбак заболел. У него была высокая температура, и он не мог встать с постели.\n\n«Боули, принеси мне таблетку из шкафа», - сказал он.\n\nСобака попыталась запрыгнуть на шкаф, где лежали таблетки, но не смог до него добраться.\n\n«Сержина»! - крикнул старик, но кот не появился.\n\n«Сержина! Сержина! » - крикнул он снова, но снова ничего не произошло.\n\n«Сержина, хочешь рыбу »?!\n\nКак только старик сказал эти слова, кот спрыгнул с крыши и мяукнул,\n\n«Мяу, мяу… я хочу рыбу».\n\n«Сержина, я не могу сегодня порыбачить, потому что болею. Когда поправлюсь, на всех хватит. Поторопись, Сержина, принеси мне таблетку из шкафа.\n\nКошка прыгнула на шкаф, но вместо того, чтобы принести таблетку старику, снова промурлыкала:\n\n«Я хочу рыбу. Мяу, мяу… »\n\n«Сержина, пожалуйста, принеси мне таблетку; иначе я не смогу встать, - грустно повторил старик, но кот не двинулся с места.\n\nБедный старик не знал, что делать, и заплакал от боли.\n\nВдруг собака взвизгнула,\n\n«Гав, гав, гав»…\n\nСтарик повернулся к Болею и увидел на земле пилюлю,\n\n«Наверняка случайно упала», - подумал он про себя и посмотрел на полку, где была Сержина.\n\nСобака принесла таблетку старому рыбаку, и через некоторое время у него стала падать температура.\n\nКогда на следующее утро старик проснулся, он снова был здоров. Он нетерпеливо бросил сеть в море и поймал много рыбы. Он сел на стул перед домом и с трубкой в ​​руке наблюдал за волнами.\n\n«Хозяин, этот кот нас погубит! Давай прогоним ее! Черная кошка, злая кошка! » взвизгнула собака.\n\n«Пусть этого никогда не будет! Вы увидите, что Сержина изменится и станет хорошей ».\n\n«Учитель, вы помните, что вы говорили то же самое о ее матери. Проклятая черная Изольда, которая рвала твои сети каждую ночь, пока была жива?\n\n«Болей, мы должны верить в силу добра. Ты увидишь. Однажды Сержина изменится и станет хорошей ».\n\nСтарый рыбак потянул трубку и задумался, но ненадолго, потому что пес снова сказал:\n\n«Хозяин, разве мы не собираемся завтракать»?\n\n«Хочешь рыбу»?\n\n\"Гав гав\"! - рявкнул пес, высунув язык. Старик бросил ему несколько больших скумбрии и похлопал по шее.\n\nТут с крыши спрыгнула голодная Сержина.\n\n«Мяу, мяу, я хочу рыбу».\n\nСтарик бросил ей рыбу и сказал:\n\n«Пожалуйста, Сержина, больше так не поступай».\n\nКот мурлыкал и продолжал тереться о руку старого рыбака, пока он мирно спал на стуле.\n\nК сожалению, когда он проснулся, старик увидел, что горит соломенная крыша его дома.\n\n«Болей, Сержина, помоги мне! Принеси воду с моря! Торопиться\"!\n\nСобака умчалась, но кошка не двинулась с места. Старик бросил ей рыбу, и она побежала к воде, но через некоторое время заснула. Старый рыбак бросил черному коту еще одну рыбу, и она снова стала помогать тушить пожар, но ненадолго. Чуть позже кончилась рыба, и Сержина снова заснула. Собака шла до изнеможения, но огонь охватил весь дом.\n\nБедный старик плакал, потому что остался без дома.\n\n\"Довольно! Я больше не могу! Черная кошка, злая кошка! » он бушевал. Затем он схватил Сержину и в гневе бросил в море.\n\nНаконец, старик сбежал от черной кошки; однако море почернело.\n\nЧерез несколько минут возле сгоревшего коттеджа появился маленький черный котенок с кривым хвостом.\n\n«Шу! Шу! Убирайся отсюда! Больше никаких черных кошек! » сердито сказал старый рыбак и прогнал котенка.\n\n«Хозяин, я надеюсь, что у тебя наконец-то есть здравый смысл», - вскричал Боули.\n\n«Болей, не надо ли нам поторопиться и построить дом заново? Что ты говоришь\"? - восторженно предложил старик.\n\n«Гав, гав… но сначала давайте поедим. Я снова голоден! »\n\n«Но вся рыба пропала». Старик почесал в затылке.\n\n\"Так что давай на рыбалку\"! предложил собаку.\n\n“Okay, Boley, bring the net”!\n\nОднако, к сожалению, когда старик забросил сеть в Черное море, он поймал лишь несколько маленьких макрель. На следующий день повторилось то же самое, только хуже. Так что день за днем ​​рыбы становилось все меньше и меньше, старик и собака становились все голоднее и голоднее, а море оставалось черным.\n\nОднажды утром бедный старик отказался выбросить сеть, так как последние несколько дней она всегда была пуста. Он стал настолько отчаянным и слабым из-за скудных кусков пищи, что упал на колени в песок с вытянутыми руками к морю,\n\n\"Зачем\"!?\n\nСтарик подошел, и Болей вскрикнул:\n\n«Он хотел украсть нашу последнюю рыбу»!\n\n«Потому что он голоден».\n\n«Мастер, ты не помнишь? Черная кошка, злая кошка! » - взвизгнула собака еще злее.\n\n«Нет, Боули, он просто голоден, как и мы. Посмотри, какой он маленький и тонкий ».\n\nНесмотря на то, что собака продолжала рычать на котенка, старик разделил последнюю рыбу на три части.\n\n«Вот, Боули, это тебе. Это для меня, а это для тебя, малышка.\n\nСтарый рыбак отдал мясо черному котенку и стал его гладить. Котенок тут же заволновался и поцарапал его острыми когтями.\n\n«Черная кошка, злая кошка»! - взвизгнул Боули.\n\n«Не говори так»! Старик отругал его. «Он просто напуган, потому что не знает нас».\n\nВсе трое ели рыбу и смотрели на море, но через некоторое время старый рыбак снова с грустью сказал:\n\n«Нам больше нечего есть. Теперь умрем с голоду ».\n\nСобака грустно захныкала, но маленький черный котенок запрыгнул на обгоревшую крышу. В этот момент селедка сказала:\n\n«Бросьте сеть в море»!\n\n«Но он черный и рыбы нет»! ответил старик.\n\nПоскольку птица больше ничего не сказала, старик решил попробовать. Он бросил сеть в море, и когда вытащил ее, она была доверху заполнена.\n\nВсе они были очень счастливы, и прямо перед отлетом чайки он сказал:\n\n«Рыбак, помни одно! Человек без веры подобен сети без рыбы! Вы снова верите в добро, и снова ваша сеть полна! »\n\nВ последующие дни, набравшись свежей энергии от обильной еды, старый рыбак перестроил коттедж. После этого он прожил еще долго, но никогда больше не терял своей веры в добро, хотя море оставалось черным.",

        "title": "The Little Mermaid",
        "lev": "B",
        "en": "Far out in the ocean, where the water is as blue as the prettiest cornflower, and as clear as crystal, it is very, very deep; so deep, indeed, that no cable could fathom it: many church steeples, piled one upon another, would not reach from the ground beneath to the surface of the water above.\n\nThere dwell the Sea King and his subjects. We must not imagine that there is nothing at the bottom of the sea but bare yellow sand. No, indeed; the most singular flowers and plants grow there; the leaves and stems of which are so pliant, that the slightest agitation of the water causes them to stir as if they had life. Fishes, both large and small, glide between the branches, as birds fly among the trees here upon land. In the deepest spot of all, stands the castle of the Sea King. Its walls are built of coral, and the long, gothic windows are of the clearest amber. The roof is formed of shells, that open and close as the water flows over them. Their appearance is very beautiful, for in each lies a glittering pearl, which would be fit for the diadem of a queen.\n\nThe Sea King had been a widower for many years, and his aged mother kept house for him. She was a very wise woman, and exceedingly proud of her high birth; on that account she wore twelve oysters on her tail; while others, also of high rank, were only allowed to wear six. She was, however, deserving of very great praise, especially for her care of the little sea-princesses, her grand-daughters. They were six beautiful children; but the youngest was the prettiest of them all; her skin was as clear and delicate as a rose-leaf, and her eyes as blue as the deepest sea; but, like all the others, she had no feet, and her body ended in a fish’s tail. All day long they played in the great halls of the castle, or among the living flowers that grew out of the walls. The large amber windows were open, and the fish swam in, just as the swallows fly into our houses when we open the windows, excepting that the fishes swam up to the princesses, ate out of their hands, and allowed themselves to be stroked. Outside the castle there was a beautiful garden, in which grew bright red and dark blue flowers, and blossoms like flames of fire; the fruit glittered like gold, and the leaves and stems waved to and fro continually. The earth itself was the finest sand, but blue as the flame of burning sulphur. Over everything lay a peculiar blue radiance, as if it were surrounded by the air from above, through which the blue sky shone, instead of the dark depths of the sea. In calm weather the sun could be seen, looking like a purple flower, with the light streaming from the calyx. Each of the young princesses had a little plot of ground in the garden, where she might dig and plant as she pleased. One arranged her flower-bed into the form of a whale; another thought it better to make hers like the figure of a little mermaid; but that of the youngest was round like the sun, and contained flowers as red as his rays at sunset. She was a strange child, quiet and thoughtful; and while her sisters would be delighted with the wonderful things which they obtained from the wrecks of vessels, she cared for nothing but her pretty red flowers, like the sun, excepting a beautiful marble statue. It was the representation of a handsome boy, carved out of pure white stone, which had fallen to the bottom of the sea from a wreck. She planted by the statue a rose-colored weeping willow. It grew splendidly, and very soon hung its fresh branches over the statue, almost down to the blue sands. The shadow had a violet tint, and waved to and fro like the branches; it seemed as if the crown of the tree and the root were at play, and trying to kiss each other. Nothing gave her so much pleasure as to hear about the world above the sea. She made her old grandmother tell her all she knew of the ships and of the towns, the people and the animals. To her it seemed most wonderful and beautiful to hear that the flowers of the land should have fragrance, and not those below the sea; that the trees of the forest should be green; and that the fishes among the trees could sing so sweetly, that it was quite a pleasure to hear them. Her grandmother called the little birds fishes, or she would not have understood her; for she had never seen birds.\n\n“When you have reached your fifteenth year,” said the grand-mother, “you will have permission to rise up out of the sea, to sit on the rocks in the moonlight, while the great ships are sailing by; and then you will see both forests and towns”.\n\nIn the following year, one of the sisters would be fifteen: but as each was a year younger than the other, the youngest would have to wait five years before her turn came to rise up from the bottom of the ocean, and see the earth as we do. However, each promised to tell the others what she saw on her first visit, and what she thought the most beautiful; for their grandmother could not tell them enough; there were so many things on which they wanted information. None of them longed so much for her turn to come as the youngest, she who had the longest time to wait, and who was so quiet and thoughtful. Many nights she stood by the open window, looking up through the dark blue water, and watching the fish as they splashed about with their fins and tails. She could see the moon and stars shining faintly; but through the water they looked larger than they do to our eyes. When something like a black cloud passed between her and them, she knew that it was either a whale swimming over her head, or a ship full of human beings, who never imagined that a pretty little mermaid was standing beneath them, holding out her white hands towards the keel of their ship.\n\nAs soon as the eldest was fifteen, she was allowed to rise to the surface of the ocean. When she came back, she had hundreds of things to talk about; but the most beautiful, she said, was to lie in the moonlight, on a sandbank, in the quiet sea, near the coast, and to gaze on a large town nearby, where the lights were twinkling like hundreds of stars; to listen to the sounds of the music, the noise of carriages, and the voices of human beings, and then to hear the merry bells peal out from the church steeples; and because she could not go near to all those wonderful things, she longed for them more than ever. Oh, did not the youngest sister listen eagerly to all these descriptions and afterwards, when she stood at the open window looking up through the dark blue water, she thought of the great city, with all its bustle and noise, and even fancied she could hear the sound of the church bells, down in the depths of the sea.\n\nIn another year the second sister received permission to rise to the surface of the water, and to swim about where she pleased. She rose just as the sun was setting, and this, she said, was the most beautiful sight of all. The whole sky looked like gold, while violet and rose-colored clouds, which she could not describe, floated over her; and, still more rapidly than the clouds, flew a large flock of wild swans towards the setting sun, looking like a long white veil across the sea. She also swam towards the sun; but it sunk into the waves, and the rosy tints faded from the clouds and from the sea.\n\nThe third sister’s turn followed; she was the boldest of them all, and she swam up a broad river that emptied itself into the sea. On the banks she saw green hills covered with beautiful vines; palaces and castles peeped out from amid the proud trees of the forest; she heard the birds singing, and the rays of the sun were so powerful that she was obliged often to dive down under the water to cool her burning face. In a narrow creek she found a whole troop of little human children, quite naked, and sporting about in the water; she wanted to play with them, but they fled in a great fright; and then a little black animal came to the water; it was a dog, but she did not know that, for she had never before seen one. This animal barked at her so terribly that she became frightened, and rushed back to the open sea. But she said she should never forget the beautiful forest, the green hills, and the pretty little children who could swim in the water, although they had not fish’s tails.\n\nThe fourth sister was more timid; she remained in the midst of the sea, but she said it was quite as beautiful there as nearer the land. She could see for so many miles around her, and the sky above looked like a bell of glass. She had seen the ships, but at such a great distance that they looked like sea-gulls. The dolphins sported in the waves, and the great whales spouted water from their nostrils till it seemed as if a hundred fountains were playing in every direction.\n\nThe fifth sister’s birthday occurred in the winter; so when her turn came, she saw what the others had not seen the first time they went up. The sea looked quite green, and large icebergs were floating about, each like a pearl, she said, but larger and loftier than the churches built by men. They were of the most singular shapes, and glittered like diamonds. She had seated herself upon one of the largest, and let the wind play with her long hair, and she remarked that all the ships sailed by rapidly, and steered as far away as they could from the iceberg, as if they were afraid of it. Towards evening, as the sun went down, dark clouds covered the sky, the thunder rolled and the lightning flashed, and the red light glowed on the icebergs as they rocked and tossed on the heaving sea. On all the ships the sails were reefed with fear and trembling, while she sat calmly on the floating iceberg, watching the blue lightning, as it darted its forked flashes into the sea.\n\nWhen first the sisters had permission to rise to the surface, they were each delighted with the new and beautiful sights they saw; but now, as grown-up girls, they could go when they pleased, and they had become indifferent about it. They wished themselves back again in the water, and after a month had passed they said it was much more beautiful down below, and pleasanter to be at home. Yet often, in the evening hours, the five sisters would twine their arms round each other, and rise to the surface, in a row. They had more beautiful voices than any human being could have; and before the approach of a storm, and when they expected a ship would be lost, they swam before the vessel, and sang sweetly of the delights to be found in the depths of the sea, and begging the sailors not to fear if they sank to the bottom. But the sailors could not understand the song, they took it for the howling of the storm. And these things were never to be beautiful for them; for if the ship sank, the men were drowned, and their dead bodies alone reached the palace of the Sea King.\n\nWhen the sisters rose, arm-in-arm, through the water in this way, their youngest sister would stand quite alone, looking after them, ready to cry, only that the mermaids have no tears, and therefore they suffer more. “Oh, were I but fifteen years old,” said she: “I know that I shall love the world up there, and all the people who live in it”.\n\nAt last she reached her fifteenth year. “Well, now, you are grown up,” said the old dowager, her grandmother; “so you must let me adorn you like your other sisters;” and she placed a wreath of white lilies in her hair, and every flower leaf was half a pearl. Then the old lady ordered eight great oysters to attach themselves to the tail of the princess to show her high rank.\n\n“But they hurt me so,” said the little mermaid.\n\n“Pride must suffer pain,” replied the old lady. Oh, how gladly she would have shaken off all this grandeur, and laid aside the heavy wreath! The red flowers in her own garden would have suited her much better, but she could not help herself: so she said, “Farewell,” and rose as lightly as a bubble to the surface of the water. The sun had just set as she raised her head above the waves; but the clouds were tinted with crimson and gold, and through the glimmering twilight beamed the evening star in all its beauty. The sea was calm, and the air mild and fresh. A large ship, with three masts, lay becalmed on the water, with only one sail set; for not a breeze stiffed, and the sailors sat idle on deck or amongst the rigging. There was music and song on board; and, as darkness came on, a hundred colored lanterns were lighted, as if the flags of all nations waved in the air. The little mermaid swam close to the cabin windows; and now and then, as the waves lifted her up, she could look in through clear glass window-panes, and see a number of well-dressed people within. Among them was a young prince, the most beautiful of all, with large black eyes; he was sixteen years of age, and his birthday was being kept with much rejoicing. The sailors were dancing on deck, but when the prince came out of the cabin, more than a hundred rockets rose in the air, making it as bright as day. The little mermaid was so startled that she dived under water; and when she again stretched out her head, it appeared as if all the stars of heaven were falling around her, she had never seen such fireworks before. Great suns spurted fire about, splendid fireflies flew into the blue air, and everything was reflected in the clear, calm sea beneath. The ship itself was so brightly illuminated that all the people, and even the smallest rope, could be distinctly and plainly seen. And how handsome the young prince looked, as he pressed the hands of all present and smiled at them, while the music resounded through the clear night air.\n\nIt was very late; yet the little mermaid could not take her eyes from the ship, or from the beautiful prince. The colored lanterns had been extinguished, no more rockets rose in the air, and the cannon had ceased firing; but the sea became restless, and a moaning, grumbling sound could be heard beneath the waves: still the little mermaid remained by the cabin window, rocking up and down on the water, which enabled her to look in. After a while, the sails were quickly unfurled, and the noble ship continued her passage; but soon the waves rose higher, heavy clouds darkened the sky, and lightning appeared in the distance. A dreadful storm was approaching; once more the sails were reefed, and the great ship pursued her flying course over the raging sea. The waves rose mountains high, as if they would have overtopped the mast; but the ship dived like a swan between them, and then rose again on their lofty, foaming crests. To the little mermaid this appeared pleasant sport; not so to the sailors. At length the ship groaned and creaked; the thick planks gave way under the lashing of the sea as it broke over the deck; the mainmast snapped asunder like a reed; the ship lay over on her side; and the water rushed in. The little mermaid now perceived that the crew were in danger; even she herself was obliged to be careful to avoid the beams and planks of the wreck which lay scattered on the water. At one moment it was so pitch dark that she could not see a single object, but a flash of lightning revealed the whole scene; she could see every one who had been on board excepting the prince; when the ship parted, she had seen him sink into the deep waves, and she was glad, for she thought he would now be with her; and then she remembered that human beings could not live in the water, so that when he got down to her father’s palace he would be quite dead. But he must not die. So she swam about among the beams and planks which strewed the surface of the sea, forgetting that they could crush her to pieces. Then she dived deeply under the dark waters, rising and falling with the waves, till at length she managed to reach the young prince, who was fast losing the power of swimming in that stormy sea. His limbs were failing him, his beautiful eyes were closed, and he would have died had not the little mermaid come to his assistance. She held his head above the water, and let the waves drift them where they would.\n\nIn the morning the storm had ceased; but of the ship not a single fragment could be seen. The sun rose up red and glowing from the water, and its beams brought back the hue of health to the prince’s cheeks; but his eyes remained closed. The mermaid kissed his high, smooth forehead, and stroked back his wet hair; he seemed to her like the marble statue in her little garden, and she kissed him again, and wished that he might live. Presently they came in sight of land; she saw lofty blue mountains, on which the white snow rested as if a flock of swans were lying upon them. Near the coast were beautiful green forests, and close by stood a large building, whether a church or a convent she could not tell. Orange and citron trees grew in the garden, and before the door stood lofty palms. The sea here formed a little bay, in which the water was quite still, but very deep; so she swam with the handsome prince to the beach, which was covered with fine, white sand, and there she laid him in the warm sunshine, taking care to raise his head higher than his body. Then bells sounded in the large white building, and a number of young girls came into the garden. The little mermaid swam out farther from the shore and placed herself between some high rocks that rose out of the water; then she covered her head and neck with the foam of the sea so that her little face might not be seen, and watched to see what would become of the poor prince. She did not wait long before she saw a young girl approach the spot where he lay. She seemed frightened at first, but only for a moment; then she fetched a number of people, and the mermaid saw that the prince came to life again, and smiled upon those who stood round him. But to her he sent no smile; he knew not that she had saved him. This made her very unhappy, and when he was led away into the great building, she dived down sorrowfully into the water, and returned to her father’s castle. She had always been silent and thoughtful, and now she was more so than ever. Her sisters asked her what she had seen during her first visit to the surface of the water; but she would tell them nothing. Many an evening and morning did she rise to the place where she had left the prince. She saw the fruits in the garden ripen till they were gathered, the snow on the tops of the mountains melt away; but she never saw the prince, and therefore she returned home, always more sorrowful than before. It was her only comfort to sit in her own little garden, and fling her arm round the beautiful marble statue which was like the prince; but she gave up tending her flowers, and they grew in wild confusion over the paths, twining their long leaves and stems round the branches of the trees, so that the whole place became dark and gloomy. At length she could bear it no longer, and told one of her sisters all about it. Then the others heard the secret, and very soon it became known to two mermaids whose intimate friend happened to know who the prince was. She had also seen the festival on board ship, and she told them where the prince came from, and where his palace stood.\n\n“Come, little sister,” said the other princesses; then they entwined their arms and rose up in a long row to the surface of the water, close by the spot where they knew the prince’s palace stood. It was built of bright yellow shining stone, with long flights of marble steps, one of which reached quite down to the sea. Splendid gilded cupolas rose over the roof, and between the pillars that surrounded the whole building stood life-like statues of marble. Through the clear crystal of the lofty windows could be seen noble rooms, with costly silk curtains and hangings of tapestry; while the walls were covered with beautiful paintings which were a pleasure to look at. In the centre of the largest saloon a fountain threw its sparkling jets high up into the glass cupola of the ceiling, through which the sun shone down upon the water and upon the beautiful plants growing round the basin of the fountain. Now that she knew where he lived, she spent many an evening and many a night on the water near the palace. She would swim much nearer the shore than any of the others ventured to do; indeed once she went quite up the narrow channel under the marble balcony, which threw a broad shadow on the water. Here she would sit and watch the young prince, who thought himself quite alone in the bright moonlight. She saw him many times of an evening sailing in a pleasant boat, with music playing and flags waving. She peeped out from among the green rushes, and if the wind caught her long silvery-white veil, those who saw it believed it to be a swan, spreading out its wings. On many a night, too, when the fishermen, with their torches, were out at sea, she heard them relate so many good things about the doings of the young prince, that she was glad she had saved his life when he had been tossed about half-dead on the waves. And she remembered that his head had rested on her bosom, and how heartily she had kissed him; but he knew nothing of all this, and could not even dream of her. She grew more and more fond of human beings, and wished more and more to be able to wander about with those whose world seemed to be so much larger than her own. They could fly over the sea in ships, and mount the high hills which were far above the clouds; and the lands they possessed, their woods and their fields, stretched far away beyond the reach of her sight. There was so much that she wished to know, and her sisters were unable to answer all her questions. Then she applied to her old grandmother, who knew all about the upper world, which she very rightly called the lands above the sea.\n\n“If human beings are not drowned,” asked the little mermaid, “can they live forever? do they never die as we do here in the sea”?\n\n“Yes,” replied the old lady, “they must also die, and their term of life is even shorter than ours. We sometimes live to three hundred years, but when we cease to exist here we only become the foam on the surface of the water, and we have not even a grave down here of those we love. We have not immortal souls, we shall never live again; but, like the green sea-weed, when once it has been cut off, we can never flourish more. Human beings, on the contrary, have a soul which lives forever, lives after the body has been turned to dust. It rises up through the clear, pure air beyond the glittering stars. As we rise out of the water, and behold all the land of the earth, so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see”.\n\n“Why have not we an immortal soul”? asked the little mermaid mournfully; “I would give gladly all the hundreds of years that I have to live, to be a human being only for one day, and to have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars”.\n\n“You must not think of that,” said the old woman; “we feel ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings”.\n\n“So I shall die,” said the little mermaid, “and as the foam of the sea I shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the waves, or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun. Is there anything I can do to win an immortal soul”?\n\n“No,” said the old woman, “unless a man were to love you so much that you were more to him than his father or mother; and if all his thoughts and all his love were fixed upon you, and the priest placed his right hand in yours, and he promised to be true to you here and hereafter, then his soul would glide into your body and you would obtain a share in the future happiness of mankind. He would give a soul to you and retain his own as well; but this can never happen. Your fish’s tail, which amongst us is considered so beautiful, is thought on earth to be quite ugly; they do not know any better, and they think it necessary to have two stout props, which they call legs, in order to be handsome”.\n\nThen the little mermaid sighed, and looked sorrowfully at her fish’s tail. “Let us be happy,” said the old lady, “and dart and spring about during the three hundred years that we have to live, which is really quite long enough; after that we can rest ourselves all the better. This evening we are going to have a court ball”.\n\nIt is one of those splendid sights which we can never see on earth. The walls and the ceiling of the large ball-room were of thick, but transparent crystal. May hundreds of colossal shells, some of a deep red, others of a grass green, stood on each side in rows, with blue fire in them, which lighted up the whole saloon, and shone through the walls, so that the sea was also illuminated. Innumerable fishes, great and small, swam past the crystal walls; on some of them the scales glowed with a purple brilliancy, and on others they shone like silver and gold. Through the halls flowed a broad stream, and in it danced the mermen and the mermaids to the music of their own sweet singing. No one on earth has such a lovely voice as theirs. The little mermaid sang more sweetly than them all. The whole court applauded her with hands and tails; and for a moment her heart felt quite gay, for she knew she had the loveliest voice of any on earth or in the sea. But she soon thought again of the world above her, for she could not forget the charming prince, nor her sorrow that she had not an immortal soul like his; therefore she crept away silently out of her father’s palace, and while everything within was gladness and song, she sat in her own little garden sorrowful and alone. Then she heard the bugle sounding through the water, and thought—“He is certainly sailing above, he on whom my wishes depend, and in whose hands I should like to place the happiness of my life. I will venture all for him, and to win an immortal soul, while my sisters are dancing in my father’s palace, I will go to the sea witch, of whom I have always been so much afraid, but she can give me counsel and help”.\n\nAnd then the little mermaid went out from her garden, and took the road to the foaming whirlpools, behind which the sorceress lived. She had never been that way before: neither flowers nor grass grew there; nothing but bare, gray, sandy ground stretched out to the whirlpool, where the water, like foaming mill-wheels, whirled round everything that it seized, and cast it into the fathomless deep. Through the midst of these crushing whirlpools the little mermaid was obliged to pass, to reach the dominions of the sea witch; and also for a long distance the only road lay right across a quantity of warm, bubbling mire, called by the witch her turfmoor. Beyond this stood her house, in the centre of a strange forest, in which all the trees and flowers were polypi, half animals and half plants; they looked like serpents with a hundred heads growing out of the ground. The branches were long slimy arms, with fingers like flexible worms, moving limb after limb from the root to the top. All that could be reached in the sea they seized upon, and held fast, so that it never escaped from their clutches. The little mermaid was so alarmed at what she saw, that she stood still, and her heart beat with fear, and she was very nearly turning back; but she thought of the prince, and of the human soul for which she longed, and her courage returned. She fastened her long flowing hair round her head, so that the polypi might not seize hold of it. She laid her hands together across her bosom, and then she darted forward as a fish shoots through the water, between the supple arms and fingers of the ugly polypi, which were stretched out on each side of her. She saw that each held in its grasp something it had seized with its numerous little arms, as if they were iron bands. The white skeletons of human beings who had perished at sea, and had sunk down into the deep waters, skeletons of land animals, oars, rudders, and chests of ships were lying tightly grasped by their clinging arms; even a little mermaid, whom they had caught and strangled; and this seemed the most shocking of all to the little princess.\n\nShe now came to a space of marshy ground in the wood, where large, fat water-snakes were rolling in the mire, and showing their ugly, drab-colored bodies. In the midst of this spot stood a house, built with the bones of shipwrecked human beings. There sat the sea witch, allowing a toad to eat from her mouth, just as people sometimes feed a canary with a piece of sugar. She called the ugly water-snakes her little chickens, and allowed them to crawl all over her bosom.\n\n“I know what you want,” said the sea witch; “it is very stupid of you, but you shall have your way, and it will bring you to sorrow, my pretty princess. You want to get rid of your fish’s tail, and to have two supports instead of it, like human beings on earth, so that the young prince may fall in love with you, and that you may have an immortal soul”. And then the witch laughed so loud and disgustingly, that the toad and the snakes fell to the ground, and lay there wriggling about. “You are but just in time,” said the witch; “for after sunrise to-morrow I should not be able to help you till the end of another year. I will prepare a draught for you, with which you must swim to land tomorrow before sunrise, and sit down on the shore and drink it. Your tail will then disappear, and shrink up into what mankind calls legs, and you will feel great pain, as if a sword were passing through you. But all who see you will say that you are the prettiest little human being they ever saw. You will still have the same floating gracefulness of movement, and no dancer will ever tread so lightly; but at every step you take it will feel as if you were treading upon sharp knives, and that the blood must flow. If you will bear all this, I will help you”.\n\n“Yes, I will,” said the little princess in a trembling voice, as she thought of the prince and the immortal soul.\n\n“But think again,” said the witch; “for when once your shape has become like a human being, you can no more be a mermaid. You will never return through the water to your sisters, or to your father’s palace again; and if you do not win the love of the prince, so that he is willing to forget his father and mother for your sake, and to love you with his whole soul, and allow the priest to join your hands that you may be man and wife, then you will never have an immortal soul. The first morning after he marries another your heart will break, and you will become foam on the crest of the waves”.\n\n“I will do it,” said the little mermaid, and she became pale as death.\n\n“But I must be paid also,” said the witch, “and it is not a trifle that I ask. You have the sweetest voice of any who dwell here in the depths of the sea, and you believe that you will be able to charm the prince with it also, but this voice you must give to me; the best thing you possess will I have for the price of my draught. My own blood must be mixed with it, that it may be as sharp as a two-edged sword”.\n\n“But if you take away my voice,” said the little mermaid, “what is left for me”?\n\n“Your beautiful form, your graceful walk, and your expressive eyes; surely with these you can enchain a man’s heart. Well, have you lost your courage? Put out your little tongue that I may cut it off as my payment; then you shall have the powerful draught”.\n\n“It shall be,” said the little mermaid.\n\nThen the witch placed her cauldron on the fire, to prepare the magic draught.\n\n“Cleanliness is a good thing,” said she, scouring the vessel with snakes, which she had tied together in a large knot; then she pricked herself in the breast, and let the black blood drop into it. The steam that rose formed itself into such horrible shapes that no one could look at them without fear. Every moment the witch threw something else into the vessel, and when it began to boil, the sound was like the weeping of a crocodile. When at last the magic draught was ready, it looked like the clearest water. “There it is for you,” said the witch. Then she cut off the mermaid’s tongue, so that she became dumb, and would never again speak or sing. “If the polypi should seize hold of you as you return through the wood,” said the witch, “throw over them a few drops of the potion, and their fingers will be torn into a thousand pieces”. But the little mermaid had no occasion to do this, for the polypi sprang back in terror when they caught sight of the glittering draught, which shone in her hand like a twinkling star.\n\nSo she passed quickly through the wood and the marsh, and between the rushing whirlpools. She saw that in her father’s palace the torches in the ballroom were extinguished, and all within asleep; but she did not venture to go in to them, for now she was dumb and going to leave them forever, she felt as if her heart would break. She stole into the garden, took a flower from the flower-beds of each of her sisters, kissed her hand a thousand times towards the palace, and then rose up through the dark blue waters. The sun had not risen when she came in sight of the prince’s palace, and approached the beautiful marble steps, but the moon shone clear and bright. Then the little mermaid drank the magic draught, and it seemed as if a two-edged sword went through her delicate body: she fell into a swoon, and lay like one dead. When the sun arose and shone over the sea, she recovered, and felt a sharp pain; but just before her stood the handsome young prince. He fixed his coal-black eyes upon her so earnestly that she cast down her own, and then became aware that her fish’s tail was gone, and that she had as pretty a pair of white legs and tiny feet as any little maiden could have; but she had no clothes, so she wrapped herself in her long, thick hair. The prince asked her who she was, and where she came from, and she looked at him mildly and sorrowfully with her deep blue eyes; but she could not speak. Every step she took was as the witch had said it would be, she felt as if treading upon the points of needles or sharp knives; but she bore it willingly, and stepped as lightly by the prince’s side as a soap-bubble, so that he and all who saw her wondered at her graceful-swaying movements. She was very soon arrayed in costly robes of silk and muslin, and was the most beautiful creature in the palace; but she was dumb, and could neither speak nor sing.\n\nBeautiful female slaves, dressed in silk and gold, stepped forward and sang before the prince and his royal parents: one sang better than all the others, and the prince clapped his hands and smiled at her. This was great sorrow to the little mermaid; she knew how much more sweetly she herself could sing once, and she thought, “Oh if he could only know that! I have given away my voice forever, to be with him”.\n\nThe slaves next performed some pretty fairy-like dances, to the sound of beautiful music. Then the little mermaid raised her lovely white arms, stood on the tips of her toes, and glided over the floor, and danced as no one yet had been able to dance. At each moment her beauty became more revealed, and her expressive eyes appealed more directly to the heart than the songs of the slaves. Every one was enchanted, especially the prince, who called her his little foundling; and she danced again quite readily, to please him, though each time her foot touched the floor it seemed as if she trod on sharp knives.\n\nThe prince said she should remain with him always, and she received permission to sleep at his door, on a velvet cushion. He had a page’s dress made for her, that she might accompany him on horseback. They rode together through the sweet-scented woods, where the green boughs touched their shoulders, and the little birds sang among the fresh leaves. She climbed with the prince to the tops of high mountains; and although her tender feet bled so that even her steps were marked, she only laughed, and followed him till they could see the clouds beneath them looking like a flock of birds travelling to distant lands. While at the prince’s palace, and when all the household were asleep, she would go and sit on the broad marble steps; for it eased her burning feet to bathe them in the cold sea-water; and then she thought of all those below in the deep.\n\nOnce during the night her sisters came up arm-in-arm, singing sorrowfully, as they floated on the water. She beckoned to them, and then they recognized her, and told her how she had grieved them. After that, they came to the same place every night; and once she saw in the distance her old grandmother, who had not been to the surface of the sea for many years, and the old Sea King, her father, with his crown on his head. They stretched out their hands towards her, but they did not venture so near the land as her sisters did.\n\nAs the days passed, she loved the prince more fondly, and he loved her as he would love a little child, but it never came into his head to make her his wife; yet, unless he married her, she could not receive an immortal soul; and, on the morning after his marriage with another, she would dissolve into the foam of the sea.\n\n“Do you not love me the best of them all”? the eyes of the little mermaid seemed to say, when he took her in his arms, and kissed her fair forehead.\n\n“Yes, you are dear to me,” said the prince; “for you have the best heart, and you are the most devoted to me; you are like a young maiden whom I once saw, but whom I shall never meet again. I was in a ship that was wrecked, and the waves cast me ashore near a holy temple, where several young maidens performed the service. The youngest of them found me on the shore, and saved my life. I saw her but twice, and she is the only one in the world whom I could love; but you are like her, and you have almost driven her image out of my mind. She belongs to the holy temple, and my good fortune has sent you to me instead of her; and we will never part”.\n\n“Ah, he knows not that it was I who saved his life,” thought the little mermaid. “I carried him over the sea to the wood where the temple stands: I sat beneath the foam, and watched till the human beings came to help him. I saw the pretty maiden that he loves better than he loves me;” and the mermaid sighed deeply, but she could not shed tears. “He says the maiden belongs to the holy temple, therefore she will never return to the world. They will meet no more: while I am by his side, and see him every day. I will take care of him, and love him, and give up my life for his sake”.\n\nVery soon it was said that the prince must marry, and that the beautiful daughter of a neighboring king would be his wife, for a fine ship was being fitted out. Although the prince gave out that he merely intended to pay a visit to the king, it was generally supposed that he really went to see his daughter. A great company were to go with him. The little mermaid smiled, and shook her head. She knew the prince’s thoughts better than any of the others.\n\n“I must travel,” he had said to her; “I must see this beautiful princess; my parents desire it; but they will not oblige me to bring her home as my bride. I cannot love her; she is not like the beautiful maiden in the temple, whom you resemble. If I were forced to choose a bride, I would rather choose you, my dumb foundling, with those expressive eyes”. And then he kissed her rosy mouth, played with her long waving hair, and laid his head on her heart, while she dreamed of human happiness and an immortal soul. “You are not afraid of the sea, my dumb child,” said he, as they stood on the deck of the noble ship which was to carry them to the country of the neighboring king. And then he told her of storm and of calm, of strange fishes in the deep beneath them, and of what the divers had seen there; and she smiled at his descriptions, for she knew better than any one what wonders were at the bottom of the sea.\n\nIn the moonlight, when all on board were asleep, excepting the man at the helm, who was steering, she sat on the deck, gazing down through the clear water. She thought she could distinguish her father’s castle, and upon it her aged grandmother, with the silver crown on her head, looking through the rushing tide at the keel of the vessel. Then her sisters came up on the waves, and gazed at her mournfully, wringing their white hands. She beckoned to them, and smiled, and wanted to tell them how happy and well off she was; but the cabin-boy approached, and when her sisters dived down he thought it was only the foam of the sea which he saw.\n\nThe next morning the ship sailed into the harbor of a beautiful town belonging to the king whom the prince was going to visit. The church bells were ringing, and from the high towers sounded a flourish of trumpets; and soldiers, with flying colors and glittering bayonets, lined the rocks through which they passed. Every day was a festival; balls and entertainments followed one another.\n\nBut the princess had not yet appeared. People said that she was being brought up and educated in a religious house, where she was learning every royal virtue. At last she came. Then the little mermaid, who was very anxious to see whether she was really beautiful, was obliged to acknowledge that she had never seen a more perfect vision of beauty. Her skin was delicately fair, and beneath her long dark eye-lashes her laughing blue eyes shone with truth and purity.\n\n“It was you,” said the prince, “who saved my life when I lay dead on the beach,” and he folded his blushing bride in his arms. “Oh, I am too happy,” said he to the little mermaid; “my fondest hopes are all fulfilled. You will rejoice at my happiness; for your devotion to me is great and sincere”.\n\nThe little mermaid kissed his hand, and felt as if her heart were already broken. His wedding morning would bring death to her, and she would change into the foam of the sea. All the church bells rung, and the heralds rode about the town proclaiming the betrothal. Perfumed oil was burning in costly silver lamps on every altar. The priests waved the censers, while the bride and bridegroom joined their hands and received the blessing of the bishop. The little mermaid, dressed in silk and gold, held up the bride’s train; but her ears heard nothing of the festive music, and her eyes saw not the holy ceremony; she thought of the night of death which was coming to her, and of all she had lost in the world. On the same evening the bride and bridegroom went on board ship; cannons were roaring, flags waving, and in the centre of the ship a costly tent of purple and gold had been erected. It contained elegant couches, for the reception of the bridal pair during the night. The ship, with swelling sails and a favorable wind, glided away smoothly and lightly over the calm sea. When it grew dark a number of colored lamps were lit, and the sailors danced merrily on the deck. The little mermaid could not help thinking of her first rising out of the sea, when she had seen similar festivities and joys; and she joined in the dance, poised herself in the air as a swallow when he pursues his prey, and all present cheered her with wonder. She had never danced so elegantly before. Her tender feet felt as if cut with sharp knives, but she cared not for it; a sharper pang had pierced through her heart. She knew this was the last evening she should ever see the prince, for whom she had forsaken her kindred and her home; she had given up her beautiful voice, and suffered unheard-of pain daily for him, while he knew nothing of it. This was the last evening that she would breathe the same air with him, or gaze on the starry sky and the deep sea; an eternal night, without a thought or a dream, awaited her: she had no soul and now she could never win one. All was joy and gayety on board ship till long after midnight; she laughed and danced with the rest, while the thoughts of death were in her heart. The prince kissed his beautiful bride, while she played with his raven hair, till they went arm-in-arm to rest in the splendid tent. Then all became still on board the ship; the helmsman, alone awake, stood at the helm. The little mermaid leaned her white arms on the edge of the vessel, and looked towards the east for the first blush of morning, for that first ray of dawn that would bring her death. She saw her sisters rising out of the flood: they were as pale as herself; but their long beautiful hair waved no more in the wind, and had been cut off.\n\n“We have given our hair to the witch,” said they, “to obtain help for you, that you may not die to-night. She has given us a knife: here it is, see it is very sharp. Before the sun rises you must plunge it into the heart of the prince; when the warm blood falls upon your feet they will grow together again, and form into a fish’s tail, and you will be once more a mermaid, and return to us to live out your three hundred years before you die and change into the salt sea foam. Haste, then; he or you must die before sunrise. Our old grandmother moans so for you, that her white hair is falling off from sorrow, as ours fell under the witch’s scissors. Kill the prince and come back; hasten: do you not see the first red streaks in the sky? In a few minutes the sun will rise, and you must die”. And then they sighed deeply and mournfully, and sank down beneath the waves.\n\nThe little mermaid drew back the crimson curtain of the tent, and beheld the fair bride with her head resting on the prince’s breast. She bent down and kissed his fair brow, then looked at the sky on which the rosy dawn grew brighter and brighter; then she glanced at the sharp knife, and again fixed her eyes on the prince, who whispered the name of his bride in his dreams. She was in his thoughts, and the knife trembled in the hand of the little mermaid: then she flung it far away from her into the waves; the water turned red where it fell, and the drops that spurted up looked like blood. She cast one more lingering, half-fainting glance at the prince, and then threw herself from the ship into the sea, and thought her body was dissolving into foam. The sun rose above the waves, and his warm rays fell on the cold foam of the little mermaid, who did not feel as if she were dying. She saw the bright sun, and all around her floated hundreds of transparent beautiful beings; she could see through them the white sails of the ship, and the red clouds in the sky; their speech was melodious, but too ethereal to be heard by mortal ears, as they were also unseen by mortal eyes. The little mermaid perceived that she had a body like theirs, and that she continued to rise higher and higher out of the foam. “Where am I”? asked she, and her voice sounded ethereal, as the voice of those who were with her; no earthly music could imitate it.\n\n“Among the daughters of the air,” answered one of them. “A mermaid has not an immortal soul, nor can she obtain one unless she wins the love of a human being. On the power of another hangs her eternal destiny. But the daughters of the air, although they do not possess an immortal soul, can, by their good deeds, procure one for themselves. We fly to warm countries, and cool the sultry air that destroys mankind with the pestilence. We carry the perfume of the flowers to spread health and restoration. After we have striven for three hundred years to all the good in our power, we receive an immortal soul and take part in the happiness of mankind. You, poor little mermaid, have tried with your whole heart to do as we are doing; you have suffered and endured and raised yourself to the spirit-world by your good deeds; and now, by striving for three hundred years in the same way, you may obtain an immortal soul”.\n\nThe little mermaid lifted her glorified eyes towards the sun, and felt them, for the first time, filling with tears. On the ship, in which she had left the prince, there were life and noise; she saw him and his beautiful bride searching for her; sorrowfully they gazed at the pearly foam, as if they knew she had thrown herself into the waves. Unseen she kissed the forehead of her bride, and fanned the prince, and then mounted with the other children of the air to a rosy cloud that floated through the aether.\n\n“After three hundred years, thus shall we float into the kingdom of heaven,” said she. “And we may even get there sooner,” whispered one of her companions. “Unseen we can enter the houses of men, where there are children, and for every day on which we find a good child, who is the joy of his parents and deserves their love, our time of probation is shortened. The child does not know, when we fly through the room, that we smile with joy at his good conduct, for we can count one year less of our three hundred years. But when we see a naughty or a wicked child, we shed tears of sorrow, and for every tear a day is added to our time of trial”!",
        "ru": "Далеко в океане, где вода такая же голубая, как самый красивый василек, и прозрачная, как кристалл, она очень и очень глубокая; настолько глубока, что ни один кабель не мог ее постичь: многие церковные колокольни, поставленные одна на другую, не доходили от земли внизу до поверхности воды наверху. Здесь обитают морской король и его подданные. Нельзя представить себе, что на дне моря нет ничего, кроме голого желтого песка. Нет, конечно; здесь растут самые необычные цветы и растения; листья и стебли которых настолько податливы, что малейшее волнение воды заставляет их шевелиться, как будто в них есть жизнь. Рыбы, большие и маленькие, скользят между ветвями, как птицы летают среди деревьев здесь, на суше. В самом глубоком месте стоит замок Морского Короля. Его стены построены из кораллов, а длинные, готические окна - из чистейшего янтаря. Крыша состоит из ракушек, которые открываются и закрываются, когда по ним течет вода. Их вид очень красив, поскольку в каждом сверкает жемчужина, подходящая для диадемы королевы. Морской король был вдовцом много лет, и его престарелая мать вела для него дом. Она была очень мудрой женщиной и чрезвычайно гордилась своим высоким происхождением; по этой причине у нее на хвосте было двенадцать устриц; в то время как другим, также высокопоставленным, разрешалось носить только шесть. Однако она заслуживала очень большой похвалы, особенно за ее заботу о маленьких морских принцессах, своих внучках. Это были шестеро красивых детей; но самый молодой из них был самым красивым; ее кожа была чистой и нежной, как лист розы, а глаза голубыми, как самое глубокое море; но, как и все, у нее не было ног, и ее тело заканчивалось рыбьим хвостом. Весь день они играли в больших залах замка или среди живых цветов, росших из стен. Большие янтарные окна были открыты, и рыба поплыла внутрь, как ласточки летают в наши дома, когда мы открываем окна, за исключением того, что рыбы подплывали к принцессам, ели из их рук и позволяли гладить себя. За пределами замка был прекрасный сад, в котором росли ярко-красные и синие цветы, расцветавшие, как пламя огня; плоды сверкали, как золото, а листья и стебли постоянно колыхались. Сама земля была мелким песком, но голубым, как пламя горящей серы. Поверх всего лежало своеобразное голубое сияние, словно оно было окружено сверху воздухом, сквозь который просвечивало голубое небо, а не темные глубины моря. В безветренную погоду было видно солнце, похожее на пурпурный цветок, и свет струился из чашечки. У каждой из юных принцесс был небольшой участок земли в саду, где она могла копать и сажать, как ей заблагорассудится. Один устроил ее клумбу в виде кита; другой подумал, что лучше сделать ее фигурку русалочки; но цветок младшего был круглым, как солнце, и в нем были цветы, красные, как его лучи на закате. Она была странным ребенком, тихим и задумчивым; и в то время как ее сестры были бы в восторге от чудесных вещей, которые они получали из обломков кораблей, она не заботилась ни о чем, кроме своих красивых красных цветов, подобных солнцу, за исключением красивой мраморной статуи. Это было изображение красивого мальчика, вырезанного из чистого белого камня, который упал на дно моря после крушения. Она посадила у статуи розовую плакучую иву. Он великолепно рос и очень скоро свесил свои свежие ветви над статуей, почти до самого голубого песка. Тень имела фиолетовый оттенок и колыхалась взад и вперед, как ветви; Казалось, будто корона дерева и корень играют и пытаются поцеловать друг друга. Ничто не доставляло ей столько удовольствия, как слышать о мире над морем. Она заставила свою старую бабушку рассказать ей все, что она знала о кораблях и городах, людях и животных. Ей казалось самым чудесным и прекрасным слышать, что цветы земли благоухают, а не цветы, лежащие ниже моря; что деревья в лесу должны быть зелеными; и что рыбы среди деревьев так сладко пели, что было очень приятно их слышать. Ее бабушка называла птичек рыбками, или она не поняла бы ее; потому что она никогда не видела птиц. «Когда тебе исполнится пятнадцать лет, - сказала бабушка, - тебе будет позволено подняться из моря, сесть на скалах при лунном свете, пока проплывают большие корабли; и тогда вы увидите и леса, и города ». В следующем году одной из сестер исполнится пятнадцать: но поскольку каждая из них на год младше другой, младшей придется ждать пять лет, прежде чем настанет ее черед подняться со дна океана и увидеть Землю как мы делаем. Однако каждая пообещала рассказать другим, что она видела во время своего первого визита, и что она считала самым прекрасным; потому что их бабушка не могла сказать им достаточно; было так много вещей, о которых они хотели получить информацию. Никто из них так не хотел, чтобы пришла ее очередь младшей, та, у которой было больше всего времени ждать, и которая была такой тихой и задумчивой. Много ночей она стояла у открытого окна, глядя сквозь темно-синюю воду и наблюдая за рыбами, плещущимися плавниками и хвостами. Она могла видеть слабое сияние луны и звезд; но сквозь воду они казались больше, чем нашим глазам. Когда между ними и ними пролетало что-то вроде черного облака, она знала, что это либо кит, плывущий над ее головой, либо корабль, полный людей, которые и представить себе не могли, что под ними стоит симпатичная русалочка, протягивая свою белую руки к килю своего корабля. Как только старшей исполнилось пятнадцать, ей разрешили подняться на поверхность океана. Когда она вернулась, ей было о чем поговорить; но самым прекрасным, по ее словам, было лежать в лунном свете, на песчаной отмели, в тихом море, недалеко от берега, и смотреть на большой город поблизости, где огни мерцали, как сотни звезд; слушать звуки музыки, шум экипажей и голоса людей, а затем слышать веселый звон колоколов с церковных шпилей; и поскольку она не могла приблизиться ко всем этим чудесным вещам, она тосковала по ним больше, чем когда-либо. Ах, разве младшая сестра не жадно слушала все эти описания а потом, когда она стояла у открытого окна и смотрела сквозь темно-синюю воду, она думала о большом городе со всей его суетой и шумом, и даже ей казалось, что она слышит звон церковных колоколов в глубине моря. Через год вторая сестра получила разрешение подняться на поверхность воды и плавать там, где ей заблагорассудится. Она встала, когда солнце садилось, и это, по ее словам, было самым прекрасным зрелищем. Все небо выглядело как золото, а фиолетовые и розовые облака, которые она не могла описать, плыли над ней; и еще быстрее облаков полетела большая стая диких лебедей к заходящему солнцу, похожая на длинную белую пелену над морем. Она тоже плыла к солнцу; но он погрузился в волны, и розовые оттенки исчезли с облаков и с моря. Затем последовала очередь третьей сестры; она была самой смелой из всех и переплыла широкую реку, которая впадала в море. На берегу она увидела зеленые холмы, поросшие красивыми виноградными лозами; дворцы и замки выглядывали из гордых лесных деревьев; она слышала пение птиц, и солнечные лучи были настолько мощными, что ей приходилось часто нырять под воду, чтобы остудить свое горящее лицо. В узком ручье она нашла целую группу маленьких человеческих детей, совершенно обнаженных и забавляющихся в воде; она хотела поиграть с ними, но они в ужасе убежали; а затем к воде подошло маленькое черное животное; Это была собака, но она этого не знала, потому что никогда раньше не видела ее. Это животное так ужасно гавкнуло на нее, что она испугалась и бросилась обратно в открытое море. Но она сказала, что никогда не должна забывать красивый лес, зеленые холмы и хорошеньких маленьких детей, которые могут плавать в воде, хотя у них нет рыбьих хвостов. Четвертая сестра была более робкой; она осталась посреди моря, но она сказала, что там было так же красиво, как и ближе к земле. Она могла видеть на столько миль вокруг себя, а небо над головой казалось стеклянным колоколом. Она видела корабли, но на таком большом расстоянии, что они были похожи на чаек. Дельфины резвились в волнах, а огромные киты хлестали водой из ноздрей, так что казалось, будто сотни фонтанов играли во всех направлениях. Зимой у пятой сестры был день рождения; поэтому, когда подошла ее очередь, она увидела то, чего не видели другие, когда поднялись наверх. Море выглядело довольно зеленым, и вокруг плавали большие айсберги, каждый, как жемчужина, сказала она, но больше и выше, чем церкви, построенные людьми. Они были необычной формы и сверкали, как бриллианты. Она села на один из самых больших и позволила ветру играть с ее длинными волосами, и она заметила, что все корабли проплывали быстро, и держались как можно дальше от айсберга, как будто боялись его. К вечеру, когда солнце зашло, темные облака покрыли небо, грянул гром и вспыхнули молнии, и красный свет светился на айсбергах, когда они качались и метались по вздымающемуся морю. На всех кораблях от страха и трепета паруса были закружены рифами, а она спокойно сидела на плавучем айсберге, наблюдая за синей молнией, которая бросала свои раздвоенные вспышки в море. Когда сестрам впервые разрешили подняться на поверхность, каждая из них была в восторге от новых и прекрасных достопримечательностей, которые они увидели; но теперь, будучи взрослыми девочками, они могли уйти, когда захотят, и им это стало безразлично. Они пожелали снова оказаться в воде, и через месяц они сказали, что внизу намного красивее, и приятнее быть дома. Однако часто в вечерние часы пять сестер обвивали друг друга руками и поднимались на поверхность в ряд. У них были более красивые голоса, чем у любого человека; и перед приближением шторма, когда они ожидали, что корабль будет потерян, они поплыли перед судном и сладко воспели прелести, которые можно найти в морских глубинах, и умоляли моряков не бояться, если они затонут ко дну. Но моряки не могли понять песню, они приняли ее за вой шторма. И это никогда не должно было быть для них прекрасным; ибо если корабль затонет, люди утонут, и только их трупы достигнут дворца Морского Короля. Когда сестры поднимались, взявшись за руки, через воду таким образом, их младшая сестра стояла совершенно одна и смотрела им вслед готовы плакать, только то, что у русалок нет слез, и потому они страдают больше. «О, если бы мне было всего пятнадцать лет, - сказала она, - я знаю, что буду любить этот мир там и всех людей, которые в нем живут». Наконец ей исполнилось пятнадцать лет. «Ну, теперь ты выросла», - сказала старая вдова, ее бабушка; «Так что вы должны позволить мне украсить вас, как других ваших сестер»; и она возложила венок из белых лилий в свои волосы, и каждый цветочный лист был половинкой жемчужины. Тогда старушка приказала восьми огромным устрицам прикрепиться к хвосту принцессы, чтобы показать ее высокое положение. «Но они так меня обидели», - сказала русалочка. «Гордость должна терпеть боль», - ответила старушка. О, как бы она с радостью сбросила с себя все это величие и отложила тяжелый венок! Красные цветы в ее собственном саду подошли бы ей гораздо больше, но она ничего не могла с собой поделать: поэтому она сказала: «Прощай» и легко, как пузырь, поднялась на поверхность воды. Солнце только что село, когда она подняла голову над волнами; но облака были окрашены в алый и золотой цвет, и сквозь мерцающие сумерки сияла вечерняя звезда во всей своей красе. Море было спокойным, а воздух мягким и свежим. Большой корабль с тремя мачтами лежал на воде, оставив только один парус; ибо не было ни ветерка, и моряки не сидели сложа руки на палубе или среди снастей. На борту были музыка и песни; и когда наступила темнота, зажглись сотни цветных фонарей, как будто флаги всех народов развевались в воздухе. Русалочка подплывала к окнам хижины; и время от времени, когда волны поднимали ее вверх, она могла смотреть внутрь через прозрачные оконные стекла, и увидеть внутри несколько хорошо одетых людей. Среди них был молодой принц, самый красивый из всех, с большими черными глазами; ему было шестнадцать лет, и его день рождения отмечался с большой радостью. Моряки танцевали на палубе, но когда князь вышел из каюты, в воздух поднялось больше сотни ракет, сделав его ярким, как день. Русалочка так испугалась, что нырнула под воду; и когда она снова вытянула голову, казалось, будто все звезды небесные падают вокруг нее, она никогда раньше не видела такого фейерверка. Огромные солнца извергали огонь, великолепные светлячки летали в голубой воздух, и все отражалось в чистом спокойном море внизу. Сам корабль был так ярко освещен, что все люди и даже самая тонкая веревка были хорошо видны. И каким красивым выглядел молодой принц, когда он сжал руки всех присутствующих и улыбнулся им, а музыка звучала в чистом ночном воздухе. Было уже очень поздно; но русалочка не могла оторвать глаз от корабля или прекрасного принца. Цветные фонари были потушены, ракеты больше не поднимались в воздух, и пушка перестала стрелять; но море стало неспокойным, и под волнами можно было услышать стон и ворчание: русалочка все еще оставалась у окна каюты, раскачиваясь вверх и вниз на воде, что позволяло ей заглядывать внутрь. Через некоторое время паруса были быстро развернуты, и благородный корабль продолжил свой путь; но вскоре волны поднялись выше, тяжелые облака затемнили небо, и вдали показались молнии. Приближался ужасный шторм; снова паруса были поставлены на рифы, и огромный корабль продолжал свой полет над бушующим морем. Волны вздымались горами высоко, как будто они должны были перевалить за мачту; но корабль нырнул между ними, как лебедь, а затем снова поднялся на их высокие пенящиеся гребни. Русалочке это показалось приятным развлечением; не так с моряками. Наконец корабль застонал и скрипнул; толстые доски не выдержали удара моря, когда оно разбилось о палубу; грот-мачта раскололась, как тростник; корабль перевернулся на бок; и вода хлынула внутрь. Русалочка теперь почувствовала, что команда в опасности; даже она сама была вынуждена соблюдать осторожность, чтобы избежать попадания балок и досок обломков, которые лежали на воде. В какой-то момент было настолько темно, что она не могла видеть ни одного объекта, но вспышка молнии осветила всю сцену; она могла видеть всех, кто был на борту, кроме принца; когда корабль разошелся, она увидела, как он тонет в глубоких волнах, и была рада, потому что думала, что теперь он будет с ней; а потом она вспомнила, что люди не могут жить в воде, поэтому, когда он спустится во дворец ее отца, он будет совершенно мертв. Но он не должен умереть. Поэтому она плавала среди балок и досок, которыми была усыпана поверхность моря, забыв, что они могут раздавить ее на куски. Затем она нырнула глубоко под темные воды, поднимаясь и опускаясь вместе с волнами, пока, наконец, не добралась до молодого принца, который быстро терял способность плавать в этом бурном море. Его конечности подводили его, его прекрасные глаза были закрыты, и он бы умер, если бы русалочка не пришла ему на помощь. Она держала голову над водой, и пусть волны доносят их куда хотят. Утром буря утихла; но от корабля не было видно ни одного фрагмента. Солнце встало красным и сияло из воды, и его лучи вернули оттенок здоровья щекам принца; но его глаза оставались закрытыми. Русалка поцеловала его высокий гладкий лоб и откинула назад мокрые волосы; он казался ей мраморной статуей в ее маленьком саду, и она снова поцеловала его, желая, чтобы он остался в живых. Вскоре они подошли к земле; она увидела высокие синие горы, на которых покоился белый снег, словно на них лежала стая лебедей. Рядом с побережьем были красивые зеленые леса, а рядом стояло большое здание, церковь или монастырь, она не могла сказать. В саду росли апельсиновые и цитрусовые деревья, а перед дверью росли высокие пальмы. Море здесь образовывало небольшую бухту, в которой вода была совершенно спокойной, но очень глубокой; поэтому она поплыла с прекрасным принцем к берегу, покрытому мелким белым песком, и положила его на теплый солнечный свет, стараясь поднять его голову выше, чем его тело. Затем в большом белом здании зазвонили колокола, и в сад вошло несколько молодых девушек. Русалочка поплыла подальше от берега и оказалась между высокими скалами, поднимавшимися из воды; затем она покрыла голову и шею морской пеной, чтобы не было видно ее личико, и наблюдала, что станет с бедным принцем. Она не заставила себя долго ждать, как увидела молодую девушку, подходящую к тому месту, где он лежал. Сначала она казалась напуганной, но только на мгновение; затем она привела несколько человек, и русалка увидела, что принц снова ожил, и улыбнулась тем, кто стоял вокруг него. Но ей он не послал улыбки; он не знал, что она спасла его. Это сделало ее очень несчастной, и когда его увели в большое здание, она с горечью нырнула в воду и вернулась в замок своего отца. Она всегда была молчалива и задумчива, а теперь стала еще более спокойной. Сестры спросили ее, что она видела во время своего первого посещения поверхности воды; но она ничего им не рассказывала. Много вечеров и утра она поднималась на то место, где оставила князя. Она видела, как плоды в саду созревают, пока не собираются, снег на вершинах гор тает; но она никогда не видела принца, и поэтому она возвращалась домой всегда более печальной, чем прежде. Единственным утешением для нее было сидеть в собственном маленьком саду и обнимать красивую мраморную статую, похожую на принца; но она перестала ухаживать за своими цветами, и они в диком смятении росли на тропинках, обвивая своими длинными листьями и стеблями ветви деревьев, так что все место стало темным и мрачным. В конце концов, она не выдержала и рассказала все об этом одной из сестер. Затем остальные услышали секрет, и очень скоро он стал известен двум русалкам, чей близкий друг знал, кто был принц. Она также видела праздник на борту корабля и рассказала им, откуда пришел принц и где стоит его дворец. «Пойдем, сестренка», - сказали другие принцессы; потом они сцепили руки и поднялись в длинном ряду на поверхность воды, рядом с тем местом, где, как они знали, стоит княжеский дворец. Он был построен из ярко-желтого сияющего камня с длинными мраморными ступенями, одна из которых спускалась к морю. Великолепные позолоченные купола возвышались над крышей, а между колоннами, окружавшими все здание, стояли похожие на настоящие мраморные статуи. Сквозь прозрачный кристалл высоких окон виднелись дворянские комнаты с дорогими шелковыми занавесками и гобеленами; а стены были покрыты красивыми картинами, на которые было приятно смотреть. В центре самого большого салона фонтан бросал свои сверкающие струи высоко в стеклянный купол потолка, сквозь который солнце освещало воду и прекрасные растения, растущие вокруг чаши фонтана. Теперь, когда она знала, где он живет, она провела много вечеров и много ночей на воде возле дворца. Она подплыла бы к берегу гораздо ближе, чем кто-либо другой осмеливался сделать; действительно, однажды она поднялась по узкому каналу под мраморным балконом, отбрасывающим широкую тень на воду. Здесь она сидела и наблюдала за молодым принцем, который считал себя совершенно одиноким в ярком лунном свете. Она много раз видела его во время вечернего плавания в приятной лодке с музыкой и развевающимися флагами. Она выглянула из-за зеленого тростника, и если ветер уловил ее длинную серебристо-белую вуаль, те, кто ее видел, считали, что это лебедь, расправляющий крылья. Также много ночей, когда рыбаки со своими факелами выходили в море, она слышала, как они рассказывают столько хороших вещей о деяниях молодого принца, что она рада, что спасла ему жизнь, когда он был брошен полумертвым на волнах. И она вспомнила, что его голова покоилась на ее груди, и как горячо она его поцеловала; но он ничего не знал обо всем этом и даже не мог мечтать о ней. Она все больше и больше любила людей и все больше и больше желала иметь возможность бродить с теми, чей мир казался намного больше, чем ее собственный. Они могли летать над морем на кораблях и взбираться на высокие холмы, которые возвышались над облаками; и земли, которыми они владели, их леса и их поля, простирались далеко за пределы досягаемости ее взгляда. Она так много хотела узнать, и ее сестры не могли ответить на все ее вопросы. Затем она обратилась к своей старой бабушке, которая знала все о верхнем мире, который она очень справедливо называла землями над морем. «Если люди не утонут, - спросила русалочка, - смогут ли они жить вечно? они никогда не умирают, как мы здесь, в море? » «Да, - ответила старушка, - они тоже должны умереть, и срок их жизни даже короче нашего. Иногда мы доживаем до трехсот лет, но когда мы перестаем здесь существовать, мы лишь становимся пеной на поверхности воды, и у нас нет здесь даже могилы тех, кого мы любим. У нас нет бессмертных душ, мы больше никогда не будем жить; но, подобно зеленым водорослям, после того, как они срезаны, мы никогда не сможем больше процветать. Человеческие существа, напротив, имеют душу, которая живет вечно, живя после того, как тело обратилось в прах. Он поднимается в чистом чистом воздухе за сверкающими звездами. Когда мы выходим из воды и созерцаем всю землю земли, так они поднимаются в неизведанные и славные регионы, которых мы никогда не увидим ». «Почему у нас нет бессмертной души»? - печально спросила русалочка; «Я с радостью отдал бы все сотни лет, которые мне оставалось прожить, чтобы быть человеком всего один день и иметь надежду познать счастье этого великолепного мира над звездами». «Вы не должны думать об этом», сказала старуха; «Мы чувствуем, что мы намного счастливее и намного лучше людей». «Итак, я умру, - сказала русалочка, - и, как морская пена, меня никогда больше не будут водить, чтобы услышать музыку волн или увидеть красивые цветы или красное солнце. Могу ли я что-нибудь сделать, чтобы завоевать бессмертную душу? » «Нет, - сказала старуха, - если только мужчина не полюбит тебя так сильно, что ты для него больше, чем его отец или мать; и если бы все его мысли и вся его любовь были сосредоточены на тебе, и священник возложил свою правую руку на твою, и он пообещал быть верным тебе здесь и в будущем, тогда его душа соскользнет в твое тело, и ты получишь долю в будущем счастье человечества. Он отдал бы тебе душу и сохранил бы свою собственную; но этого не может быть никогда. Ваш рыбий хвост, который у нас считается таким красивым, на земле считается довольно уродливым; они не знают ничего лучшего, и они думают, что необходимо иметь две крепкие опоры, которые они называют ногами, чтобы быть красивыми ». Потом русалочка вздохнула и печально посмотрела на свой рыбий хвост. «Давайте будем счастливы, - сказала старушка, - и будем метаться и прыгать в течение трехсот лет, которые нам предстоит прожить, а этого на самом деле достаточно; после этого мы сможем лучше отдохнуть. Сегодня вечером у нас будет судебный бал ». Это одно из тех великолепных мест, которых мы никогда не увидим на земле. Стены и потолок большого бального зала были из толстого, но прозрачного хрусталя. Пусть сотни колоссальных раковин, одни темно-красного цвета, другие зеленого цвета травы, стояли рядами по бокам, с голубым огнем в них, который освещал весь салон и светил сквозь стены, так что море тоже было освещенный. Бесчисленные рыбы, большие и маленькие, проплывали мимо хрустальных стен; на одних чешуя сияла пурпурным блеском, а на других сияла, как серебро и золото. Через залы текла широкая речка, и в ней танцевали русалки и русалки под музыку собственного сладкого пения. Ни у кого на земле нет такого прекрасного голоса, как у них. Русалочка пела нежнее всех. Весь суд аплодировал ей руками и решкой; и на мгновение ее сердце наполнилось радостью, потому что она знала, что у нее самый прекрасный голос на земле или в море. Но вскоре она снова подумала о мире над ней, потому что она не могла забыть об очаровательном принце и свою печаль, что у нее нет такой бессмертной души, как у него; поэтому она тихо выскользнула из дворца своего отца, и, хотя все внутри было радостью и песнями, она сидела в своем собственном маленьком саду, печальная и одна. Затем она услышала звук горна, звенящего в воде, и подумала: «Он определенно плывет наверху, тот, от кого зависят мои желания, и в чьи руки я хотел бы передать счастье своей жизни. Я рискну всем ради него и завоюю бессмертную душу, пока мои сестры танцуют во дворце моего отца, Я пойду к морской ведьме, которой я всегда так боялся, но она может дать мне совет и помочь. И тогда русалочка вышла из своего сада и направилась к пенящимся водоворотам, за которыми жила колдунья. Она никогда не была такой раньше: ни цветы, ни трава там не росли; только голая, серая, песчаная земля простиралась до водоворота, где вода, как пенящиеся мельничные колеса, кружилась вокруг всего, что захватывала, и бросала в бездонную бездну. Посреди этих сокрушительных водоворотов русалочке пришлось пройти, чтобы достичь владений морской ведьмы; а также на большом расстоянии единственная дорога лежала прямо через теплую пузырящуюся болото, которую ведьма называла своим торфяным болотом. За этим стоял ее дом, посреди странного леса, в котором все деревья и цветы были полипами, наполовину животными и наполовину растениями; они были похожи на змей с сотней голов, вырастающих из земли. Ветви представляли собой длинные слизистые руки с пальцами, похожими на гибких червей, движущиеся конечность за конечностью от корня к вершине. Все, чего можно было достичь в море, они схватили и держали так, чтобы оно никогда не ускользало из их лап. Русалочка была так напугана увиденным, что остановилась, и ее сердце билось от страха, и она почти повернула назад; но она подумала о принце и о человеческой душе, о которой она мечтала, и ее храбрость вернулась. Она укладывала свои длинные распущенные волосы вокруг головы, чтобы полипы не цеплялись за них. Она сложила руки на груди и рванулась вперед, как рыба стреляет в воду, между гибкими руками и пальцами уродливого полипа, растянутыми по бокам от нее. Она увидела, что каждый держал в руках что-то, что схватил своими многочисленными ручонками, как если бы они были железными лентами. Белые скелеты человеческих существ, погибших в море и погрузившихся в глубокие воды, скелеты наземных животных, весла, рули и сундуки кораблей лежали, крепко схваченные их цепкими руками; даже русалочку, которую поймали и задушили; и это показалось маленькой принцессе самым шокирующим из всех. Теперь она подошла к участку болотистой земли в лесу, где большие толстые водяные змеи катались по болоте и обнажали свои уродливые тусклые тела. Посреди этого места стоял дом, построенный из костей людей, потерпевших кораблекрушение. Там сидела морская ведьма, позволяя жабе есть изо рта, точно так же, как люди иногда кормят канарейку кусочком сахара. Она назвала уродливых водяных змей своими маленькими цыплятами и позволила им ползать по ее груди. «Я знаю, чего ты хочешь», - сказала морская ведьма; «Это очень глупо с твоей стороны, но ты добьешься своего, и это принесет тебе печаль, моя прекрасная принцесса. Вы хотите избавиться от своего рыбьего хвоста и иметь вместо него две опоры, как человеческие существа на земле, чтобы юный принц мог влюбиться в вас и чтобы у вас была бессмертная душа ». А потом ведьма так громко и противно засмеялась, что жаба и змеи упали на землю и легли, извиваясь. «Ты как раз вовремя», - сказала ведьма; «Потому что после восхода солнца завтра я не смогу помочь тебе до конца другого года. Я подготовлю для тебя проект, с которым вы должны плыть, чтобы приземлиться завтра до восхода солнца, сесть на берегу и выпить. Затем ваш хвост исчезнет и превратится в то, что человечество называет ногами, и вы почувствуете сильную боль, как если бы меч прошел сквозь вас. Но все, кто тебя увидят, скажут, что ты самый красивый человечек, которого они когда-либо видели. У вас по-прежнему будет та же плавная грациозность движений, и ни один танцор никогда не будет шагать так легко; но на каждом шагу будет казаться, будто вы наступаете на острые ножи, и кровь должна течь. Если ты выдержишь все это, я помогу тебе ». «Да, буду», - сказала маленькая принцесса дрожащим голосом, думая о принце и бессмертной душе. «Но подумай еще раз», - сказала ведьма; «Потому что, когда ваша форма станет похожей на человека, вы больше не сможете быть русалкой. Вы никогда больше не вернетесь через воду к своим сестрам или во дворец своего отца; и если вы не завоюете любовь князя, так что он готов забыть своих отца и мать ради вас, и любить вас всей своей душой, и позволить священнику соединить ваши руки, чтобы вы могли быть мужчиной и жена, тогда у тебя никогда не будет бессмертной души. В первое утро после того, как он женится на другом, ваше сердце разобьется, и вы превратитесь в пену на гребне волн ». «Я сделаю это», - сказала русалочка и побледнела как смерть. «Но мне тоже должны заплатить, - сказала ведьма, - и я прошу не о пустяках. У тебя самый сладкий голос из всех, кто живет здесь, в морских глубинах, и ты веришь, что сможешь очаровать им и принца, но этот голос ты должен передать мне; лучшее, что у тебя есть, я получу по цене моего проекта. Моя собственная кровь должна быть смешана с ним, чтобы он был острым, как обоюдоострый меч ». «Но если ты уберешь мой голос, - сказала русалочка, - что мне останется»? «Ваша красивая форма, ваша изящная походка и ваши выразительные глаза; Конечно, ими можно сковать сердце мужчины. Ну что, мужество растерялось? Высуньте свой язычок, чтобы я отрезал его в качестве платы; тогда у вас будет сильная тяга ». «Будет, - сказала русалочка. Затем ведьма поставила свой котел на огонь, чтобы приготовить магический напиток. «Чистота - это хорошо», - сказала она, протирая сосуд змеями, которые она связала в большой узел; затем она уколола себя в грудь и позволила черной крови капнуть в нее. Поднявшийся пар принял такие ужасные формы, что никто не мог смотреть на них без страха. Каждую секунду ведьма бросала в сосуд что-то еще, и когда он закипал, звук походил на плач крокодила. Когда наконец волшебный напиток был готов, он выглядел как чистейшая вода. «Вот оно для тебя», - сказала ведьма. Затем она отрезала русалке язык, чтобы она стала немой и больше никогда не говорила и не пела. «Если полипы схватят вас, когда вы вернетесь через лес, - сказала ведьма, - бросьте на них несколько капель зелья, и их пальцы разорвутся на тысячу кусочков». Но у русалочки не было случая сделать это, потому что полипы в ужасе отскочили назад, когда увидели сверкающий сквозняк, который сиял в ее руке, как мерцающая звезда. Так она быстро прошла через лес и болото, и между стремительными водоворотами. Она увидела, что во дворце ее отца факелы в бальном зале погасли, и все внутри спали; но она не решилась войти к ним, потому что теперь она была немой и собиралась покинуть их навсегда, ей казалось, что ее сердце разобьется. Она прокралась в сад, взяла по цветку с клумбы каждой из своих сестер, тысячу раз поцеловала руку в сторону дворца и затем поднялась в темно-синих водах. Солнце еще не взошло, когда она увидела дворец князя и подошла к прекрасным мраморным ступеням, но луна светила ясно и ярко. Потом русалочка выпила волшебный напиток, и казалось, будто обоюдоострый меч прошел сквозь ее нежное тело: она упала в обморок и лежала как мертвая. Когда солнце встало и засияло над морем, она поправилась и почувствовала острую боль; но прямо перед ней стоял красивый молодой принц. Он так пристально посмотрел на нее своими угольно-черными глазами, что она опустила свои собственные, а затем осознал, что ее рыбий хвост исчез, и что у нее такая же красивая пара белых и крошечных ножек, как у любой маленькой девушки; но на ней не было одежды, поэтому она закуталась в длинные густые волосы. Князь спросил ее, кто она такая и откуда она, и она посмотрела на него мягко и печально своими темно-синими глазами; но она не могла говорить. Каждый шаг, который она делала, был таким, как и сказала ведьма, ей казалось, что она наступает на кончики игл или острых ножей; но она терпела это охотно и легко шагала рядом с князем, как мыльный пузырь, так что он и все, кто видел ее, удивлялись ее грациозно-покачивающимся движениям. Очень скоро она была одета в дорогие одежды из шелка и муслина и стала самым красивым существом во дворце; но она была немой и не могла ни говорить, ни петь. Прекрасные рабыни, одетые в шелк и золото, выступили вперед и пели перед принцем и его царственными родителями: одна пела лучше всех, а принц хлопал в ладоши и улыбался ей. Это было большим горем для русалочки; она знала, насколько нежнее она сама могла однажды петь, и подумала: «О, если бы он только знал это! Я навсегда отдал свой голос, чтобы быть с ним ». Затем рабы исполнили несколько красивых сказочных танцев под красивую музыку. Затем русалочка подняла свои прекрасные белые ручки, встала на кончики пальцев и заскользила по полу, и танцевал, как никто еще не умел танцевать. С каждым мгновением ее красота становилась все более явной, а ее выразительные глаза больше обращались к сердцу, чем песни рабов. Все были очарованы, особенно принц, который называл ее своим маленьким подкидышем; и она снова танцевала довольно охотно, чтобы доставить ему удовольствие, хотя каждый раз, когда ее нога касалась пола, казалось, будто она наступала на острые ножи. Принц сказал, что она всегда должна оставаться с ним, и получила разрешение спать у его дверей на бархатной подушке. Он сделал для нее пажное платье, чтобы она могла сопровождать его верхом. Они вместе ехали по благоухающему лесу, где зеленые ветви касались их плеч, а птички пели среди свежих листьев. Она поднялась с принцем на вершины высоких гор; и хотя ее нежные ступни кровоточили, так что даже ее шаги были отмечены, она только смеялась и следовала за ним, пока они не увидели облака под ними, похожие на стаю птиц, путешествующих в далекие страны. Находясь во дворце князя и когда все домашние спали, она уходила и садилась на широкие мраморные ступени; потому что это облегчило ее горящие ноги, чтобы купать их в холодной морской воде; а потом она подумала обо всех тех, кто внизу, в глубине. Однажды ночью ее сестры подошли, взявшись за руки, печально напевая, плавая по воде. Она поманила их, и они узнали ее и рассказали, как она их огорчила. После этого они каждую ночь приходили в одно и то же место; и однажды она увидела вдалеке свою старую бабушку, которая много лет не была на поверхности моря, и старого Морского Короля, своего отца, с короной на голове. Они протянули к ней руки, но не решились так близко к земле, как ее сестры. Шли дни, и она любила принца все сильнее, а он любил ее, как маленького ребенка, но ему никогда не приходило в голову сделать ее своей женой; однако, если он не женился на ней, она не могла получить бессмертную душу; а наутро после его свадьбы с другим она растворяется в морской пене. «Разве ты не любишь меня больше всех»? - казалось, говорили глаза русалочки, когда он обнял ее и поцеловал в ее светлый лоб. «Да, ты мне дорог», - сказал князь; «У тебя самое лучшее сердце, и ты самый преданный мне; Вы похожи на юную девушку, которую я однажды видел, но с которой я никогда больше не встречусь. Я был на корабле, который потерпел крушение, и волны выбросили меня на берег возле святого храма, где служили несколько девушек. Самый молодой из них нашел меня на берегу и спас мне жизнь. Я видел ее только дважды, и она единственная в мире, кого я мог любить; но вы похожи на нее, и вы почти выбросили ее образ из моей головы. Она принадлежит святому храму, и моя удача прислала тебя ко мне вместо нее; и мы никогда не расстанемся ». «Ах, он не знает, что это я спасла ему жизнь», - подумала русалочка. «Я перенес его через море в лес, где стоит храм: я сидел под пеной и наблюдал, пока люди не пришли ему на помощь. Я видел хорошенькую девушку, которую он любит больше, чем меня »; и русалка глубоко вздохнула, но она не могла пролить слезы. «Он говорит, что девушка принадлежит святому храму, поэтому она никогда не вернется в мир. Они больше не будут встречаться: пока я рядом с ним, и вижу его каждый день. Я буду заботиться о нем, буду любить его и отдам свою жизнь ради него ». Очень скоро было сказано, что принц должен жениться и что прекрасная дочь соседнего царя станет его женой, так как достраивают прекрасный корабль. Хотя принц сообщил, что просто намеревался нанести визит королю, обычно предполагалось, что он действительно пошел навестить свою дочь. С ним должна была отправиться большая компания. Русалочка улыбнулась и покачала головой. Она знала мысли принца лучше, чем кто-либо другой. «Я должен путешествовать», - сказал он ей; «Я должен увидеть эту прекрасную принцессу; мои родители желают этого; но они не обяжут меня привести ее домой в качестве невесты. Я не могу ее любить; она не похожа на красивую девушку в храме, на которую вы похожи. Если бы мне пришлось выбирать невесту, я бы предпочел выбрать тебя, мой тупой подкидыш, с такими выразительными глазами ». А потом он поцеловал ее розовые губы, поиграл ее длинными развевающимися волосами и положил голову ей на сердце, а она мечтала о человеческом счастье и бессмертной душе. «Ты не боишься моря, мое глупое дитя», - сказал он, когда они стояли на палубе благородного корабля, который должен был доставить их в страну соседнего короля. А затем он рассказал ей о шторме и штиле, о странных рыбах в глубине под ними и о том, что там видели ныряльщики; и она улыбнулась его описаниям, потому что она лучше, чем кто-либо, знала, какие чудеса творится на дне моря. В лунном свете, когда все на борту спали, кроме человека у руля, который управлял, она села на палубу, глядя сквозь прозрачную воду. Ей казалось, что она может различить замок своего отца, а на нем свою престарелую бабушку с серебряной короной на голове, смотрящую сквозь стремительный поток на киль корабля. Тогда ее сестры поднялись на волну и печально смотрели на нее, заламывая белые руки. Она поманила их, улыбнулась и хотела сказать им, насколько она счастлива и благополучна; но юнга подошла, и когда ее сестры нырнули вниз, он подумал, что он видел только морскую пену. На следующее утро корабль вошел в гавань прекрасного города, принадлежащего королю, которого принц собирался посетить. Звонили церковные колокола, и с высоких башен раздавались рожки; и солдаты, с флагами и блестящими штыками, выровняли скалы, через которые они прошли. Каждый день был праздником; балы и развлечения следовали один за другим. Но принцесса еще не появилась. Говорили, что она воспитывалась и воспитывалась в религиозном доме, где познавала все королевские добродетели. Наконец она пришла. Затем русалочка, которой очень хотелось убедиться, действительно ли она красива, была вынуждена признать, что никогда не видела более совершенного видения красоты. Ее кожа была изящно светлой, а смеющиеся голубые глаза под длинными темными ресницами сияли правдой и чистотой. «Это ты, - сказал принц, - спас мне жизнь, когда я лежал мертвым на пляже», и он обнял краснеющую невесту. «О, я слишком счастлив», - сказал он русалочке; «Все мои самые большие надежды сбылись. Вы будете радоваться моему счастью; ибо твоя преданность мне велика и искренна ». Русалочка поцеловала его руку, и ей показалось, что ее сердце уже разбито. Его свадебное утро принесет ей смерть, и она превратится в морскую пену. Звонили все церковные колокола, и глашатаи разъезжали по городу, провозглашая обручение. Ароматные масла горели в дорогих серебряных лампадах на каждом алтаре. Священники махали кадильницами, а жених и невеста взялись за руки и получили благословение епископа. Русалочка, одетая в шелк и золото, держала шлейф невесты; но ее уши не слышали праздничной музыки, и ее глаза не видели священной церемонии; она думала о приближающейся к ней ночи смерти и обо всем, что она потеряла в этом мире. В тот же вечер жених и невеста отправились на борт корабля; ревели пушки, развевались флаги, а в центре корабля был воздвигнут дорогой пурпурно-золотой шатер. В нем были элегантные диваны для приема молодоженов в ночное время. Корабль с раздутыми парусами и попутным ветром плавно и легко скользил по спокойному морю. Когда стемнело, зажглось несколько цветных ламп, и моряки весело танцевали на палубе. Русалочка не могла не думать о своем первом подъеме из моря, когда она видела подобные праздники и радости; и она присоединилась к танцу, приподнялась в воздухе, как ласточка, когда он преследует свою добычу, и все присутствующие с удивлением подбадривали ее. Она никогда раньше не танцевала так элегантно. Ее нежные ступни казались порезанными острыми ножами, но ей это было наплевать; более резкая боль пронзила ее сердце. Она знала, что это был последний вечер, когда она когда-либо увидела принца, ради которого она оставила свою родню и свой дом; она отказалась от своего прекрасного голоса и каждый день страдала от неслыханной для него боли, а он ничего об этом не знал. Это был последний вечер, когда она дышала с ним одним воздухом или смотрела на звездное небо и глубокое море; Вечная ночь, без мыслей и снов, ждала ее: у нее не было души, и теперь она никогда не могла победить. На борту корабля до полуночи царила радость и веселье; она смеялась и танцевала с остальными, в то время как мысли о смерти были в ее сердце. Принц целовал свою прекрасную невесту, пока она играла с его волосами цвета воронова крыла, пока они, взявшись за руки, не пошли отдыхать в великолепном шатре. Потом все замерло на борту корабля; рулевой, один проснувшийся, стоял у руля. Русалочка оперлась белыми руками о край сосуда и посмотрела на восток в поисках первого утреннего румянца, того первого луча зари, который принесет ей смерть. Она видела своих сестер, восставших из наводнения: они были такими же бледными, как она; но их длинные прекрасные волосы больше не развевались на ветру и были острижены. «Мы отдали наши волосы ведьме, - сказали они, - чтобы помочь тебе, чтобы ты не умер сегодня ночью. Она дала нам нож: вот, видите, он очень острый. Перед восходом солнца вы должны окунуться в сердце принца; когда теплая кровь упадет на ваши ноги, они снова срастутся и превратятся в рыбий хвост, и вы снова станете русалкой и вернетесь к нам, чтобы прожить свои триста лет, прежде чем вы умрете и превратитесь в соленое море пена. Тогда поспешите; он или вы должны умереть до восхода солнца. Наша старая бабушка так стонет по тебе, что ее седые волосы падают от печали, как наши упали под ножницы ведьмы. Убейте принца и вернитесь; Спешите: разве вы не видите первые красные полосы на небе? Через несколько минут взойдет солнце, и ты умрешь ». А потом они глубоко и грустно вздохнули и погрузились в волны. Русалочка отдернула малиновую занавеску шатра и увидела прекрасную невесту, положив голову на грудь князя. Она наклонилась и поцеловала его светлый лоб, затем посмотрела на небо, на котором розовый рассвет становился все ярче и ярче; потом она взглянула на острый нож и снова устремила взгляд на принца, который во сне шептал имя своей невесты. Она была в его мыслях, и нож в руке русалочки дрожал: затем она швырнула его подальше от себя в волны; вода в месте падения стала красной, а брызнувшие капли были похожи на кровь. Она бросила еще один долгий, полуобморочный взгляд на принца, а затем бросилась с корабля в море и подумала, что ее тело растворяется в пене. Солнце поднималось над волнами, и его теплые лучи падали на холодную пену русалочки, которая не чувствовала себя умирающей. Она увидела яркое солнце, и вокруг нее плавали сотни прозрачных красивых существ; она могла видеть сквозь них белые паруса корабля и красные облака в небе; их речь была мелодичной, но слишком неземной, чтобы ее могли услышать уши смертных, поскольку они также были невидимы для глаз смертных. Русалочка заметила, что у нее такое же тело, как у них, и что она продолжает подниматься все выше и выше из пены. \"Где я\"? - спросила она, и голос ее прозвучал неземно, как голос тех, кто был с ней; никакая земная музыка не могла подражать этому. «Среди дочерей воздуха», - ответила одна из них. «У русалки нет бессмертной души, и она не может получить ее, если не завоюет любовь человеческого существа. От власти другого зависит ее вечная судьба. Но дочери воздуха, хотя и не обладают бессмертной душой, своими добрыми делами могут добыть себе ее. Мы летим в теплые страны и остужаем знойный воздух, уничтожающий человечество эпидемией. Мы несем аромат цветов для распространения здоровья и восстановления. После того, как мы триста лет стремились ко всему добру, которое было в наших силах, мы обретаем бессмертную душу и участвуем в счастье человечества. Ты, бедная русалочка, всем сердцем пытались делать то, что делаем мы; вы страдали, терпели и возвысились до духовного мира своими добрыми делами; и теперь, стремясь таким же образом в течение трехсот лет, вы можете получить бессмертную душу ». Русалочка подняла свои прославленные глаза к солнцу и почувствовала, как они впервые наполняются слезами. На корабле, на котором она оставила принца, была жизнь и шум; она видела, как он и его прекрасная невеста искали ее; с грустью смотрели они на жемчужную пену, как будто знали, что она бросилась в волны. Незримо она поцеловала в лоб своей невесты и обмахнула принца веером, а затем поднялась вместе с другими детьми воздуха на розовое облако, плывущее в эфире. «Через триста лет мы поплывем в Царство Небесное, - сказала она. «И мы, возможно, даже доберемся туда раньше», - прошептала одна из ее спутников. «Незримо мы можем войти в дома людей, где есть дети, и каждый день, когда мы находим хорошего ребенка, который является радостью своих родителей и заслуживает их любви, время нашего испытания сокращается. Когда мы летим по комнате, ребенок не знает, что мы радостно улыбаемся его хорошему поведению, потому что мы можем считать на год меньше из наших трехсот лет. Но когда мы видим непослушного или злого ребенка, мы проливаем слезы печали, и за каждую слезу день добавляется к нашему времени испытаний! » когда мы летим по комнате, мы радостно улыбаемся его хорошему поведению, потому что мы можем считать на один год меньше из наших трехсот лет. Но когда мы видим непослушного или злого ребенка, мы проливаем слезы печали, и за каждую слезу день добавляется к нашему времени испытаний! » когда мы летим по комнате, мы радостно улыбаемся его хорошему поведению, потому что мы можем считать на один год меньше из наших трехсот лет. Но когда мы видим непослушного или злого ребенка, мы проливаем слезы печали, и за каждую слезу день добавляется к нашему времени испытаний! »",

        "en": "JACK SELLS THE COW.\n\nOnce upon a time there was a poor widow who lived in a little cottage with her only son Jack.\n\nJack was a giddy, thoughtless boy, but very kind-hearted and affectionate. There had been a hard winter, and after it the poor woman had suffered from fever and ague. Jack did no work as yet, and by degrees they grew dreadfully poor. The widow saw that there was no means of keeping Jack and herself from starvation but by selling her cow; so one morning she said to her son, `I am too weak to go myself, Jack, so you must take the cow to market for me, and sell her.’\n\nJack liked going to market to sell the cow very much; but as he was on the way, he met a butcher who had some beautiful beans in his hand. Jack stopped to look at them, and the butcher told the boy that they were of great value, and persuaded the silly lad to sell the cow for these beans.\n\nWhen he brought them home to his mother instead of the money she expected for her nice cow, she was very vexed and shed many tears, scolding Jack for his folly. He was very sorry, and mother and son went to bed very sadly that night; their last hope seemed gone.\n\nAt daybreak Jack rose and went out into the garden.\n\n`At least,’ he thought, `I will sow the wonderful beans. Mother says that they are just common scarlet-runners, and nothing else; but I may as well sow them.’\n\nSo he took a piece of stick, and made some holes in the ground, and put in the beans.\n\nThat day they had very little dinner, and went sadly to bed, knowing that for the next day there would be none and Jack, unable to sleep from grief and vexation, got up at day-dawn and went out into the garden.\n\nWhat was his amazement to find that the beans had grown up in the night, and climbed up and up till they covered the high cliff that sheltered the cottage, and disappeared above it! The stalks had twined and twisted themselves together till they formed quite a ladder.\n\n`It would be easy to climb it,’ thought Jack.\n\nAnd, having thought of the experiment, he at once resolved to carry it out, for Jack was a good climber. However, after his late mistake about the cow, he thought he had better consult his mother first.\n\nWONDERFUL GROWTH OF THE BEANSTALK.\n\nSo Jack called his mother, and they both gazed in silent wonder at the Beanstalk, which was not only of great height, but was thick enough to bear Jack’s weight.\n\n`I wonder where it ends,’ said Jack to his mother; `I think I will climb up and see.’\n\nHis mother wished him not to venture up this strange ladder, but Jack coaxed her to give her consent to the attempt, for he was certain there must be something wonderful in the Beanstalk; so at last she yielded to his wishes.\n\nJack instantly began to climb, and went up and up on the ladder- like bean till everything he had left behind him–the cottage, the village, and even the tall church tower–looked quite little, and still he could not see the top of the Beanstalk.\n\nJack felt a little tired, and thought for a moment that he would go back again; but he was a very persevering boy, and he knew that the way to succeed in anything is not to give up. So after resting for a moment he went on.\n\nAfter climbing higher and higher, till he grew afraid to look down for fear he should be giddy, Jack at last reached the top of the Beanstalk, and found himself in a beautiful country, finely wooded, with beautiful meadows covered with sheep. A crystal stream ran through the pastures; not far from the place where he had got off the Beanstalk stood a fine, strong castle.\n\nJack wondered very much that he had never heard of or seen this castle before; but when he reflected on the subject, he saw that it was as much separated from the village by the perpendicular rock on which it stood as if it were in another land.\n\nWhile Jack was standing looking at the castle, a very strange- looking woman came out of the wood, and advanced towards him.\n\nShe wore a pointed cap of quilted red satin turned up with ermine, her hair streamed loose over her shoulders, and she walked with a staff. Jack took off his cap and made her a bow.\n\n`If you please, ma’am,’ said he, `is this your house?’\n\n`No,’ said the old lady. `Listen, and I will tell you the story of that castle.\n\n`Once upon a time there was a noble knight, who lived in this castle, which is on the borders of Fairyland. He had a fair and beloved wife and several lovely children: and as his neighbours, the little people, were very friendly towards him, they bestowed on him many excellent and precious gifts.\n\n`Rumour whispered of these treasures; and a monstrous giant, who lived at no great distance, and who was a very wicked being, resolved to obtain possession of them.\n\n`So he bribed a false servant to let him inside the castle, when the knight was in bed and asleep, and he killed him as he lay. Then he went to the part of the castle which was the nursery, and also killed all the poor little ones he found there.\n\n`Happily for her, the lady was not to be found. She had gone with her infant son, who was only two or three months old, to visit her old nurse, who lived in the valley; and she had been detained all night there by a storm.\n\n`The next morning, as soon as it was light, one of the servants at the castle, who had managed to escape, came to tell the poor lady of the sad fate of her husband and her pretty babes. She could scarcely believe him at first, and was eager at once to go back and share the fate of her dear ones; but the old nurse, with many tears, besought her to remember that she had still a child, and that it was her duty to preserve her life for the sake of the poor innocent.\n\n`The lady yielded to this reasoning, and consented to remain at her nurse’s house as the best place of concealment; for the servant told her that the giant had vowed, if he could find her, he would kill both her and her baby. Years rolled on. The old nurse died, leaving her cottage and the few articles of furniture it contained to her poor lady, who dwelt in it, working as a peasant for her daily bread. Her spinning-wheel and the milk of a cow, which she had purchased with the little money she had with her, sufficed for the scanty subsistence of herself and her little son. There was a nice little garden attached to the cottage, in which they cultivated peas, beans, and cabbages, and the lady was not ashamed to go out at harvest time, and glean in the fields to supply her little son’s wants.\n\n`Jack, that poor lady is your mother. This castle was once your father’s, and must again be yours.’\n\nJack uttered a cry of surprise.\n\n`My mother! Oh, madam, what ought I to do? My poor father! My dear mother!’\n\n`Your duty requires you to win it back for your mother. But the task is a very difficult one, and full of peril, Jack. Have you courage to undertake it?’\n\n`I fear nothing when I am doing right,’ said Jack.\n\n`Then,’ said the lady in the red cap, `you are one of those who slay giants. You must get into the castle, and if possible possess yourself of a hen that lays golden eggs, and a harp that talks. Remember, all the giant possesses is really yours.’ As she ceased speaking, the lady of the red hat suddenly disappeared, and of course Jack knew she was a fairy.\n\nJack determined at once to attempt the adventure; so he advanced, and blew the horn which hung at the castle portal. The door was opened in a minute or two by a frightful giantess, with one great eye in the middle of her forehead.\n\nAs soon as Jack saw her he turned to run away, but she caught him, and dragged him into the castle.\n\n`Ho, ho!’ she laughed terribly. `You didn’t expect to see me here, that is clear! No, I shan’t let you go again. I am weary of my life. I am so overworked, and I don’t see why I should not have a page as well as other ladies. And you shall be my boy. You shall clean the knives, and black the boots, and make the fires, and help me generally when the giant is out. When he is at home I must hide you, for he has eaten up all my pages hitherto, and you would be a dainty morsel, my little lad.’\n\nWhile she spoke she dragged Jack right into the castle. The poor boy was very much frightened, as I am sure you and I would have been in his place. But he remembered that fear disgraces a man; so he struggled to be brave and make the best of things.\n\n`I am quite ready to help you, and do all I can to serve you, madam,’ he said, `only I beg you will be good enough to hide me from your husband, for I should not like to be eaten at all.’\n\n`That’s a good boy,’ said the Giantess, nodding her head; `it is lucky for you that you did not scream out when you saw me, as the other boys who have been here did, for if you had done so my husband would have awakened and have eaten you, as he did them, for breakfast. Come here, child; go into my wardrobe: he never ventures to open THAT; you will be safe there.’\n\nAnd she opened a huge wardrobe which stood in the great hall, and shut him into it. But the keyhole was so large that it ad- mitted plenty of air, and he could see everything that took place through it. By-and-by he heard a heavy tramp on the stairs, like the lumbering along of a great cannon, and then a voice like thunder cried out:\n\n`Fe, fa, fi-fo-fum, I smell the breath of an Englishman. Let him be alive or let him be dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread.’\n\n`Wife,’ cried the Giant, `there is a man in the castle. Let me have him for breakfast.’\n\n`You are grown old and stupid!’ cried the lady in her loud tones. `It is only a nice fresh steak off an elephant, that I have cooked for you, which you smell. There, sit down and make a good breakfast.’\n\nAnd she placed a huge dish before him of savoury steaming meat, which greatly pleased him, and made him forget his idea of an Englishman being in the castle. When he had breakfasted he went out for a walk; and then the Giantess opened the door, and made Jack come out to help her. He helped her all day. She fed him well, and when evening came put him back in the wardrobe.\n\nTHE HEN THAT LAYS GOLDEN EGGS.\n\nThe Giant came in to supper. Jack watched him through the keyhole, and was amazed to see him pick a wolf’s bone, and put half a fowl at a time into his capacious mouth.\n\nWhen the supper was ended he bade his wife bring him his hen that laid the golden eggs.\n\n`It lays as well as it did when it belonged to that paltry knight,’ he said; `indeed I think the eggs are heavier than ever.’\n\nThe Giantess went away, and soon returned with a little brown hen, which she placed on the table before her husband. `And now, my dear,’ she said, `I am going for a walk, if you don’t want me any longer.’\n\n`Go,’ said the Giant; `I shall be glad to have a nap by-and-by.’\n\nThen he took up the brown hen and said to her:\n\n`Lay!’ And she instantly laid a golden egg.\n\n`Lay!’ said the Giant again. And she laid another.\n\n`Lay!’ he repeated the third time. And again a golden egg lay on the table.\n\nNow Jack was sure this hen was that of which the fairy had spoken.\n\nBy-and-by the Giant put the hen down on the floor, and soon after went fast asleep, snoring so loud that it sounded like thunder.\n\nDirectly Jack perceived that the Giant was fast asleep, he pushed open the door of the wardrobe and crept out; very softly he stole across the room, and, picking up the hen, made haste to quit the apartment. He knew the way to the kitchen, the door of which he found was left ajar; he opened it, shut and locked it after him, and flew back to the Beanstalk, which he descended as fast as his feet would move.\n\nWhen his mother saw him enter the house she wept for joy, for she had feared that the fairies had carried him away, or that the Giant had found him. But Jack put the brown hen down before her, and told her how he had been in the Giant’s castle, and all his adventures. She was very glad to see the hen, which would make them rich once more.\n\nTHE MONEY BAGS.\n\nJack made another journey up the Beanstalk to the Giant’s castle one day while his mother had gone to market; but first he dyed his hair and disguised himself. The old woman did not know him again, and dragged him in as she had done before, to help her to do the work; but she heard her husband coming, and hid him in the wardrobe, not thinking that it was the same boy who had stolen the hen. She bade him stay quite still there, or the Giant would eat him.\n\nThen the Giant came in saying:\n\n`Fe, fa, fi-fo-fum, I smell the breath of an Englishman. Let him be alive or let him be dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread.’\n\n`Nonsense!’ said the wife, `it is only a roasted bullock that I thought would be a tidbit for your supper; sit down and I will bring it up at once.’ The Giant sat down, and soon his wife brought up a roasted bullock on a large dish, and they began their supper. Jack was amazed to see them pick the bones of the bullock as if it had been a lark. As soon as they had finished their meal, the Giantess rose and said:\n\n`Now, my dear, with your leave I am going up to my room to finish the story I am reading. If you want me call for me.’\n\n`First,’ answered the Giant, `bring me my money bags, that I may count my golden pieces before I sleep.’ The Giantess obeyed. She went and soon returned with two large bags over her shoulders, which she put down by her husband.\n\n`There,’ she said; `that is all that is left of the knight’s money. When you have spent it you must go and take another baron’s castle.’\n\n`That he shan’t, if I can help it,’ thought Jack.\n\nThe Giant, when his wife was gone, took out heaps and heaps of golden pieces, and counted them, and put them in piles, till he was tired of the amusement. Then he swept them all back into their bags, and leaning back in his chair fell fast asleep, snoring so loud that no other sound was audible.\n\nJack stole softly out of the wardrobe, and taking up the bags of money (which were his very own, because the Giant had stolen them from his father), he ran off, and with great difficulty descending the Beanstalk, laid the bags of gold on his mother’s table. She had just returned from town, and was crying at not finding Jack.\n\n`There, mother, I have brought you the gold that my father lost.’\n\n`Oh, Jack! You are a very good boy, but I wish you would not risk your precious life in the Giant’s castle. Tell me how you came to go there again.’\n\nAnd Jack told her all about it.\n\nJack’s mother was very glad to get the money, but she did not like him to run any risk for her.\n\nBut after a time Jack made up his mind to go again to the Giant’s castle.\n\nTHE TALKING HARP.\n\nSo he climbed the Beanstalk once more, and blew the horn at the Giant’s gate. The Giantess soon opened the door; she was very stupid, and did not know him again, but she stopped a minute before she took him in. She feared another robbery; but Jack’s fresh face looked so innocent that she could not resist him, and so she bade him come in, and again hid him away in the wardrobe.\n\nBy-and-by the Giant came home, and as soon as he had crossed the threshold he roared out:\n\n`Fe, fa, fi-fo-fum, I smell the breath of an Englishman. Let him be alive or let him be dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread.’\n\n`You stupid old Giant,’ said his wife, `you only smell a nice sheep, which I have grilled for your dinner.’\n\nAnd the Giant sat down, and his wife brought up a whole sheep for his dinner. When he had eaten it all up, he said:\n\n`Now bring me my harp, and I will have a little music while you take your walk.’\n\nThe Giantess obeyed, and returned with a beautiful harp. The framework was all sparkling with diamonds and rubies, and the strings were all of gold.\n\n`This is one of the nicest things I took from the knight,’ said the Giant. `I am very fond of music, and my harp is a faithful servant.’\n\nSo he drew the harp towards him, and said:\n\n`Play!’\n\nAnd the harp played a very soft, sad air.\n\n`Play something merrier!’ said the Giant.\n\nAnd the harp played a merry tune.\n\n`Now play me a lullaby,’ roared the Giant; and the harp played a sweet lullaby, to the sound of which its master fell asleep.\n\nThen Jack stole softly out of the wardrobe, and went into the huge kitchen to see if the Giantess had gone out; he found no one there, so he went to the door and opened it softly, for he thought he could not do so with the harp in his hand.\n\nThen he entered the Giant’s room and seized the harp and ran away with it; but as he jumped over the threshold the harp called out:\n\n`MASTER! MASTER!’\n\nAnd the Giant woke up.\n\nWith a tremendous roar he sprang from his seat, and in two strides had reached the door.\n\nBut Jack was very nimble. He fled like lightning with the harp, talking to it as he went (for he saw it was a fairy), and telling it he was the son of its old master, the knight.\n\nStill the Giant came on so fast that he was quite close to poor Jack, and had stretched out his great hand to catch him. But, luckily, just at that moment he stepped upon a loose stone, stumbled, and fell flat on the ground, where he lay at his full length.\n\nThis accident gave Jack time to get on the Beanstalk and hasten down it; but just as he reached their own garden he beheld the Giant descending after him.\n\n`Mother I mother!’ cried Jack, `make haste and give me the axe.’\n\nHis mother ran to him with a hatchet in her hand, and Jack with one tremendous blow cut through all the Beanstalks except one.\n\n`Now, mother, stand out of the way!’ said he.\n\nTHE GIANT BREAKS HIS NECK.\n\nJack’s mother shrank back, and it was well she did so, for just as the Giant took hold of the last branch of the Beanstalk, Jack cut the stem quite through and darted from the spot.\n\nDown came the Giant with a terrible crash, and as he fell on his head, he broke his neck, and lay dead at the feet of the woman he had so much injured.\n\nBefore Jack and his mother had recovered from their alarm and agitation, a beautiful lady stood before them.\n\n`Jack,’ said she, `you have acted like a brave knight’s son, and deserve to have your inheritance restored to you. Dig a grave and bury the Giant, and then go and kill the Giantess.’\n\n`But,’ said Jack, `I could not kill anyone unless I were fighting with him; and I could not draw my sword upon a woman. Moreover, the Giantess was very kind to me.’\n\nThe Fairy smiled on Jack.\n\n`I am very much pleased with your generous feeling,’ she said. `Nevertheless, return to the castle, and act as you will find needful.’\n\nJack asked the Fairy if she would show him the way to the castle, as the Beanstalk was now down. She told him that she would drive him there in her chariot, which was drawn by two peacocks. Jack thanked her, and sat down in the chariot with her.\n\nThe Fairy drove him a long distance round, till they reached a village which lay at the bottom of the hill. Here they found a number of miserable-looking men assembled. The Fairy stopped her carriage and addressed them:\n\n`My friends,’ said she, `the cruel giant who oppressed you and ate up all your flocks and herds is dead, and this young gentleman was the means of your being delivered from him, and is the son of your kind old master, the knight.’\n\nThe men gave a loud cheer at these words, and pressed forward to say that they would serve Jack as faithfully as they had served his father. The Fairy bade them follow her to the castle, and they marched thither in a body, and Jack blew the horn and demanded admittance.\n\nThe old Giantess saw them coming from the turret loop-hole. She was very much frightened, for she guessed that something had happened to her husband; and as she came downstairs very fast she caught her foot in her dress, and fell from the top to the bottom and broke her neck.\n\nWhen the people outside found that the door was not opened to them, they took crowbars and forced the portal. Nobody was to be seen, but on leaving the hall they found the body of the Giantess at the foot of the stairs.\n\nThus Jack took possession of the castle. The Fairy went and brought his mother to him, with the hen and the harp. He had the Giantess buried, and endeavored as much as lay in his power to do right to those whom the Giant had robbed.\n\nBefore her departure for fairyland, the Fairy explained to Jack that she had sent the butcher to meet him with the beans, in order to try what sort of lad he was.\n\nIf you had looked at the gigantic Beanstalk and only stupidly wondered about it, ‘ she said, `I should have left you where misfortune had placed you, only restoring her cow to your mother. But you showed an inquiring mind, and great courage and enterprise, therefore you deserve to rise; and when you mounted the Beanstalk you climbed the Ladder of Fortune.’\n\nShe then took her leave of Jack and his mother.",
        "ru": "ДЖЕК ПРОДАЕТ КОРОВУ.\n\nЖила-была бедная вдова, которая жила в маленьком коттедже со своим единственным сыном Джеком.\n\nДжек был легкомысленным, легкомысленным мальчиком, но очень добрым и ласковым. Была суровая зима, и после нее бедная женщина заболела лихорадкой и лихорадкой. Джек еще не работал, и постепенно они стали ужасно бедными.Вдова увидела, что нет другого способа спасти Джека и ее от голода, кроме как продать свою корову; поэтому однажды утром она сказала своему сыну: «Я слишком слаба, чтобы идти сама, Джек, так что ты должен отвести корову на рынок для меня и продать ее».\n\nДжеку очень нравилось ходить на рынок, чтобы продать корову; но по дороге он встретил мясника, у которого в руке было несколько красивых бобов. Джек остановился, чтобы посмотреть на них, и мясник сказал мальчику, что они имеют большую ценность, и убедил глупого парня продать корову за эти бобы.\n\nКогда он принес их домой матери вместо денег, которые она ожидала получить за свою милую корову, она очень рассердилась и пролила много слез, ругая Джека за его глупость. Ему было очень жаль, и в ту ночь мать и сын легли спать очень грустно; их последняя надежда казалась исчезнувшей.\n\nНа рассвете Джек встал и вышел в сад.\n\n«По крайней мере, - думал он, - я сею чудесные бобы. Мама говорит, что они обычные алые бегуны, и ничего больше; но с таким же успехом я могу их сеять ».\n\nОн взял кусок палки, проделал в земле несколько отверстий и насыпал бобы.\n\nВ тот день они очень мало поужинали и с грустью легли спать, зная, что завтра их не будет, и Джек, не в силах уснуть от горя и досады, встал на рассвете и вышел в сад.\n\nКаково было его изумление, когда он обнаружил, что бобы выросли ночью и взбирались все выше и выше, пока не покрыли высокий утес, укрывавший коттедж, и исчезли над ним! Стебли переплелись и скрутились, так что образовалась настоящая лестница.\n\n«Было бы легко взобраться на нее», - подумал Джек.\n\nИ, подумав об эксперименте, он сразу решил его провести, потому что Джек был хорошим альпинистом. Однако после его последней ошибки насчет коровы он подумал, что ему лучше сначала посоветоваться с матерью.\n\nЧУДЕСНЫЙ РОСТ Бобового стебля.\n\nИтак, Джек позвал свою мать, и они оба в молчаливом изумлении уставились на Бобовый стебель, который был не только большого роста, но и достаточно толстым, чтобы выдержать вес Джека.\n\n«Интересно, где это кончается», - сказал Джек матери; «Я думаю, что залезу и посмотрю».\n\nЕго мать хотела, чтобы он не рисковал подниматься по этой странной лестнице, но Джек уговорил ее дать согласие на попытку, поскольку он был уверен, что в Бобовом стебле должно быть что-то чудесное; так что наконец она уступила его желаниям.\n\nДжек тотчас же начал карабкаться вверх и вверх по лестнице, как фасоль, пока все, что он оставил после себя - коттедж, деревня и даже высокая церковная башня - не выглядело совсем маленьким, и все же он не мог видеть вершину бобового стебля.\n\nДжек почувствовал себя немного уставшим и на мгновение подумал, что вернется сюда снова; но он был очень настойчивым мальчиком, и он знал, что способ добиться успеха в любом деле - это не сдаваться. Итак, немного отдохнув, он пошел дальше.\n\nПоднимаясь все выше и выше, пока он не стал бояться смотреть вниз из-за страха, что у него закружится голова, Джек, наконец, достиг вершины Бобового стебля и оказался в прекрасной стране, заросшей прекрасным лесом, с красивыми лугами, покрытыми овцами. По пастбищам бежал хрустальный ручей; недалеко от того места, где он сошел с Бобового стебля, стоял прекрасный крепкий замок.\n\nДжек очень удивился, что он никогда раньше не слышал об этом замке и не видел его; но когда он поразмыслил над этим предметом, он увидел, что он был так же отделен от деревни отвесной скалой, на которой он стоял, как если бы он находился в другой стране.\n\nПока Джек смотрел на замок, из леса вышла очень странная женщина и подошла к нему.\n\nНа ней была остроконечная фуражка из красного атласа, подбитая горностаем, волосы ниспадали на плечи, и она ходила с посохом. Джек снял кепку и поклонился ей.\n\n«Пожалуйста, мэм, - сказал он, - это ваш дом»?\n\n«Нет», - сказала старушка. `Послушайте, и я расскажу вам историю этого замка.\n\n`Жил-был знатный рыцарь, который жил в этом замке, который находится на границе Сказочной страны. У него была прекрасная и любимая жена и несколько прекрасных детей; а так как его соседи, маленькие люди, были очень дружелюбны по отношению к нему, они одарили его множеством прекрасных и драгоценных подарков.\n\n`Ходили слухи об этих сокровищах; и чудовищный великан, который жил неподалеку и был очень злым существом, решил завладеть ими.\n\n`Итак, он подкупил ложного слугу, чтобы тот впустил его в замок, когда рыцарь был в постели и спал, и убил его, когда тот лежал. Затем он пошел в ту часть замка, которая была детской, и также убил всех бедных малышей, которых нашел там.\n\n`К счастью для нее, дамы так и не нашли. Она поехала со своим маленьким сыном, которому было всего два или три месяца, навестить свою старую няню, которая жила в долине; и она провела там всю ночь во время бури.\n\n`На следующее утро, как только рассвело, один из слуг в замке, которому удалось бежать, пришел рассказать бедной даме о печальной судьбе ее мужа и ее хорошеньких малышек. Сначала она с трудом поверила ему и сразу же хотела вернуться и разделить судьбу своих близких; но старая кормилица со слезами умоляла ее вспомнить, что у нее еще ребенок, и что ее долг - сохранить свою жизнь ради бедных невинных.\n\n`Леди согласилась с этим доводом и согласилась остаться в доме няни, как лучшем месте укрытия; поскольку слуга сказал ей, что великан поклялся, что если он сможет найти ее, он убьет и ее, и ее ребенка. Шли годы. Старая няня умерла, оставив свой коттедж и немногочисленные предметы мебели своей бедной даме, которая жила в нем и работала крестьянином за свой хлеб насущный. Ее прялка и коровье молоко, которое она купила на те небольшие деньги, которые у нее были при ней, хватало на скудное существование ее самой и ее маленького сына. К коттеджу примыкал красивый небольшой сад, в котором выращивали горох, бобы и капусту, и дама не стеснялась выходить во время сбора урожая и собирать урожай на полях, чтобы удовлетворить нужды своего маленького сына.\n\n`Джек, эта бедная женщина - твоя мать. Этот замок когда-то принадлежал твоему отцу и должен снова стать твоим.\n\nДжек вскрикнул от удивления.\n\n`Моя мама! О, сударыня, что мне делать? Бедный отец! Моя дорогая мама!\n\n`Ваш долг требует, чтобы вы вернули его своей матери. Но задача очень сложная и полная опасностей, Джек. Есть ли у вас смелость взяться за это? '\n\n«Я ничего не боюсь, когда поступаю правильно, - сказал Джек.\n\n«Тогда, - сказала дама в красной шапочке, - вы один из тех, кто убивает гигантов. Вы должны попасть в замок и, если возможно, завладеть курицей, несущей золотые яйца, и говорящей арфой. Помни, все, чем обладает великан, действительно твое. Когда она замолчала, дама в красной шляпе внезапно исчезла, и, конечно же, Джек знал, что она фея.\n\nДжек решил сразу же попробовать приключение; поэтому он подошел и затрубил в рог, висевший у портала замка. Дверь через минуту или две открыла страшная великанша с большим глазом посередине лба.\n\nКак только Джек увидел ее, он повернулся, чтобы бежать, но она поймала его и затащила в замок.\n\n`Хо-хо! ' она ужасно засмеялась. `Вы не ожидали увидеть меня здесь, это ясно! Нет, я тебя больше не отпущу. Я устал от своей жизни. Я так перегружена работой и не понимаю, почему мне не следует иметь паж так же, как другим дамам. И ты будешь моим мальчиком. Ты очистишь ножи, почернешь сапоги, разожжешь костры и вообще поможешь мне, когда великан уйдет. Когда он дома, я должен спрятать тебя, потому что он до сих пор съел все мои страницы, а ты был бы лакомым кусочком, мой маленький мальчик ».\n\nПока она говорила, она затащила Джека прямо в замок. Бедный мальчик был очень напуган, потому что я уверен, что мы с вами были бы на его месте. Но он вспомнил, что страх позорит человека; поэтому он изо всех сил старался быть храбрым и извлекать из этого лучшее.\n\n«Я вполне готов помочь вам, и делаю все, что могу, чтобы служить вам, мадам, - сказал он, - только я прошу вас быть достаточно хорошими, чтобы спрятать меня от вашего мужа, потому что я вообще не хочу, чтобы меня съели.'\n\n«Хороший мальчик», - сказала великанша, кивая головой; `Вам повезло, что вы не закричали, когда увидели меня, как другие мальчики, которые были здесь, потому что, если бы вы сделали это, мой муж проснулся бы и съел вас, как он их, на завтрак . Подойди сюда, дитя; зайти в мой гардероб: он никогда не решается открывать ТО; там ты будешь в безопасности ».\n\nИ она открыла огромный шкаф, стоявший в большом холле, и заперла его в нем. Но замочная скважина была такой большой, что пропускала много воздуха, и он мог видеть через нее все, что происходило. Мало-помалу он услышал тяжелый топот по лестнице, похожий на грохот огромной пушки, а затем раздался громовой голос:\n\n`Фе, фа, фи-фо-фум, я чувствую запах англичанина. Пусть он будет жив или пусть будет мертв, я размол ему кости, чтобы испечь себе хлеб ».\n\n«Жена, - воскликнул Великан, - в замке есть человек. Дай мне его на завтрак.\n\n- Вы постарели и глупы! - громко воскликнула дама. `Я приготовил для вас только красивый свежий бифштекс со слона, который вы чувствуете. Вот, сядь и приготовь хороший завтрак.\n\nИ она поставила перед ним огромное блюдо с пикантным дымящимся мясом, что ему очень понравилось и заставило его забыть о том, что в замке находится англичанин. Завтракав, он пошел гулять; затем великанша открыла дверь и заставила Джека выйти, чтобы помочь ей. Он помогал ей весь день. Она его хорошо кормила, а когда наступил вечер, снова убрала в шкаф.\n\nКУРА С ЗОЛОТЫМИ ЯЙЦАМИ.\n\nВеликан пришел к ужину. Джек наблюдал за ним через замочную скважину и был поражен, увидев, как он срывает волчью кость и кладет в свой большой рот по половине курицы за раз.\n\nКогда ужин закончился, он велел жене принести ему курицу, несущую золотые яйца.\n\n«Он лежит так же хорошо, как когда принадлежал этому жалкому рыцарю», - сказал он; «Я действительно думаю, что яйца тяжелее, чем когда-либо».\n\nВеликанша ушла и вскоре вернулась с коричневой курочкой, которую она поставила на стол перед мужем. «А теперь, моя дорогая, - сказала она, - я иду прогуляться, если я тебе больше не нужен».\n\n«Иди», - сказал Великан; «Я буду рад немного вздремнуть».\n\nЗатем он взял коричневую курицу и сказал ей:\n\n`Lay! ' И она моментально снесла золотое яйцо.\n\n`Lay! ' - снова сказал Великан. И заложила еще одну.\n\n`Lay! ' повторил он в третий раз. И снова на столе лежало золотое яйцо.\n\nТеперь Джек был уверен, что это курица, о которой говорила фея.\n\nВскоре Великан положил курицу на пол и вскоре заснул, храпя так громко, что это походило на гром.\n\nКак только Джек заметил, что Великан крепко спит, он толкнул дверь шкафа и выскользнул; очень тихо он прокрался через комнату и, взяв курицу, поспешил покинуть квартиру. Он знал дорогу на кухню, дверь которой, как он обнаружил, оставалась приоткрытой; он открыл ее, закрыл и запер за собой и полетел обратно к Бобовому стеблю, по которому он спускался так быстро, как могли двигаться его ноги.\n\nКогда его мать увидела, что он вошел в дом, она заплакала от радости, потому что боялась, что феи унесли его или что Великан нашел его. Но Джек положил коричневую курицу перед ней и рассказал ей, как он побывал в замке Великана и обо всех своих приключениях. Она была очень рада увидеть курицу, от которой они снова разбогатели.\n\nДЕНЕЖНЫЕ СУМКИ.\n\nОднажды Джек совершил еще одно путешествие по Бобовому стеблю к замку Гиганта, когда его мать пошла на рынок; но сначала он покрасил волосы и переоделся. Старая женщина не узнала его снова и затащила его, как прежде, чтобы помочь ей сделать работу; но она услышала, как идет муж, и спрятала его в шкафу, не думая, что это был тот же мальчик, который украл курицу. Она велела ему оставаться здесь, иначе Великан его съест.\n\nЗатем пришел Великан и сказал:\n\n`Фе, фа, фи-фо-фум, я чувствую запах англичанина. Пусть он будет жив или пусть будет мертв, я размол ему кости, чтобы испечь себе хлеб ».\n\n`Вздор! ' сказала жена, «это только жареный бык, который я думал, будет лакомым кусочком для вашего ужина; сядь, и я сразу подниму его. Великан сел, и вскоре его жена принесла жареного быка на большом блюде, и они начали ужинать. Джек был поражен, увидев, как они подбирают кости быка, как если бы это был жаворонок. Как только они закончили ужинать, великанша встала и сказала:\n\n«А теперь, моя дорогая, с вашего позволения я поднимусь в свою комнату, чтобы закончить рассказ, который я читаю. Если хочешь, позови меня.\n\n«Сначала, - ответил Великан, - принеси мне мои мешки с деньгами, чтобы я мог пересчитать свои золотые монеты перед сном». Великанша повиновалась. Она пошла и вскоре вернулась с двумя большими сумками на плечах, которые положил ее муж.\n\n«Вот, - сказала она; `это все, что осталось от денег рыцаря. Когда вы их потратите, вы должны пойти и взять замок другого барона ».\n\n«Что он не будет, если я могу помочь», - подумал Джек.\n\nВеликан, когда его жена ушла, вынул груды и кучи золотых монет, сосчитал их и сложил в кучу, пока ему не надоест веселье. Затем он запихнул их всех обратно в сумки и, откинувшись на спинку стула, крепко заснул, храпя так громко, что не было слышно ни одного звука.\n\nДжек тихонько вытащил из шкафа и, взяв мешки с деньгами (которые были его собственными, потому что Великан украл их у его отца), он убежал и с большим трудом спустился по Бобовому стеблю, положил мешки с золотом на столе его матери. Она только что вернулась из города и плакала, не найдя Джека.\n\n«Вот, мама, я принес тебе золото, которое потерял мой отец».\n\n`О, Джек! Ты очень хороший мальчик, но я бы хотел, чтобы ты не рисковал своей драгоценной жизнью в замке Великана. Расскажи, как ты снова туда попал?\n\nИ Джек рассказал ей об этом.\n\nМать Джека была очень рада получить деньги, но ей не хотелось, чтобы он рисковал ради нее.\n\nНо через некоторое время Джек решил снова отправиться в замок Великана.\n\nГоворящая арфа.\n\nИтак, он снова взобрался на Бобовый стебель и затрубил в рог у ворот Великана. Великанша вскоре открыла дверь; она была очень глупа и больше не узнала его, но остановилась за минуту до того, как забрала его. Она боялась нового ограбления; но свежее лицо Джека выглядело настолько невинным, что она не могла сопротивляться ему, поэтому она пригласила его войти и снова спрятала его в шкафу.\n\nВскоре Великан вернулся домой и, переступив порог, закричал:\n\n`Фе, фа, фи-фо-фум, я чувствую запах англичанина. Пусть он будет жив или пусть будет мертв, я размол ему кости, чтобы испечь себе хлеб ».\n\n«Ты, глупый старый великан, - сказала его жена, - ты чувствуешь запах только хорошей овцы, которую я приготовила на гриле для твоего обеда».\n\nИ Великан сел, и жена его принесла ему на обед целую овцу. Когда он все это съел, он сказал:\n\n«А теперь принеси мне мою арфу, и я послушаю немного музыки, пока ты гуляешь».\n\nВеликанша послушалась и вернулась с красивой арфой. Каркас сверкал бриллиантами и рубинами, а все струны были из золота.\n\n«Это одна из самых прекрасных вещей, которые я взял у рыцаря», - сказал Великан. «Я очень люблю музыку, и моя арфа - верный слуга».\n\nОн пододвинул к себе арфу и сказал:\n\n`Играй! '\n\nА арфа играла очень тихо и грустно.\n\n`Сыграй что-нибудь повеселее! ' сказал Великан.\n\nИ арфа сыграла веселую мелодию.\n\n«А теперь сыграй мне колыбельную» - взревел Великан и арфа сыграла сладкую колыбельную, под звуки которой ее хозяин заснул.\n\nЗатем Джек тихонько вылез из шкафа и пошел на огромную кухню посмотреть, не вышла ли великанша; Он никого там не нашел, поэтому подошел к двери и тихонько ее открыл, так как думал, что не сможет сделать это с арфой в руке.\n\nЗатем он вошел в комнату Великана, схватил арфу и убежал с ней; но когда он перепрыгнул через порог, арфа крикнула:\n\n`MASTER! MASTER!’\n\nИ Великан проснулся.\n\nС ужасающим ревом он вскочил со своего места и двумя шагами добрался до двери.\n\nНо Джек был очень шустрым. Он бежал, как молния, с арфой, разговаривая с ней на ходу (поскольку он видел, что это была фея), и говорил ей, что он сын ее старого хозяина, рыцаря.\n\nТем не менее Великан приближался так быстро, что он был довольно близко к бедному Джеку, и протянул свою большую руку, чтобы поймать его. Но, к счастью, как раз в этот момент он наступил на рыхлый камень, споткнулся и упал на землю, где и лежал во весь рост.\n\nЭта авария дала Джеку время, чтобы выбраться на Бобовый стебель и поспешить по нему; но когда он достиг их собственного сада, он увидел Гиганта, спускающегося за ним.\n\n«Мать, я мать»! - воскликнул Джек - Поскорее отдай мне топор.\n\nЕго мать подбежала к нему с топором в руке, и Джек одним мощным ударом прорезал все бобовые стебли, кроме одного.\n\n«А теперь, мама, стой с дороги»! сказал он.\n\nГИГАНТ СЛОМАЕТ ШЕЮ.\n\nМать Джека отпрянула, и это было хорошо, потому что как только Гигант схватился за последнюю ветвь Бобового стебля, Джек полностью прорезал стебель и бросился с места.\n\nВеликан упал с ужасным грохотом и, упав на голову, сломал себе шею и лежал мертвым у ног женщины, которую он так сильно ранил.\n\nПрежде чем Джек и его мать оправились от своей тревоги и волнения, перед ними предстала красивая женщина.\n\n«Джек, - сказала она, - ты поступил как сын храброго рыцаря и заслужил возвращение тебе своего наследства. Выкопайте могилу и похороните Великана, а затем идите и убейте Великаншу.\n\n«Но, - сказал Джек, - я не мог никого убить, если не сражался с ним; и я не мог навести свой меч на женщину. Более того, великанша была ко мне очень добра ».\n\nФея улыбнулась Джеку.\n\n«Мне очень приятно ваше щедрое чувство», - сказала она. `Тем не менее, возвращайтесь в замок и действуйте так, как сочтете нужным. '\n\nДжек спросил Фею, не покажет ли она ему дорогу к замку, поскольку Бобовый стебель уже упал. Она сказала ему, что отвезет его туда на своей колеснице, запряженной двумя павлинами. Джек поблагодарил ее и сел с ней в колесницу.\n\nФея увезла его на большое расстояние, пока они не достигли деревни, которая лежала у подножия холма. Здесь они обнаружили несколько человек с жалким видом. Фея остановила карету и обратилась к ним:\n\n«Друзья мои, - сказала она, - жестокий великан, который угнетал вас и поедал все ваши стада и стада, мертв, и этот молодой джентльмен был средством вашего избавления от него, и он сын вашего доброго старого хозяина, рыцарь'.\n\nМужчины громко приветствовали эти слова и двинулись вперед, чтобы сказать, что они будут служить Джеку так же верно, как они служили его отцу. Фея велела им следовать за ней в замок, и они двинулись туда целым корпусом, а Джек затрубил в рог и потребовал допуска.\n\nСтарая великанша видела, как они идут из бойницы в башне. Она была очень напугана, так как догадалась, что что-то случилось с ее мужем; и, спускаясь вниз очень быстро, она зацепилась ногой за платье, упала сверху вниз и сломала себе шею.\n\nКогда люди снаружи обнаружили, что дверь им не открыта, они взяли ломы и взломали портал. Никого не было видно, но, выйдя из холла, они нашли тело великанши у подножия лестницы.\n\nТаким образом, Джек завладел замком. Фея пошла и привела к нему его мать, курицу и арфу. Он похоронил великаншу и изо всех сил старался поступить правильно с теми, кого ограбил Великан.\n\nПеред отъездом в сказочную страну Фея объяснила Джеку, что послала мясника встретить его с фасолью, чтобы узнать, что он за парень.\n\nЕсли бы вы смотрели на гигантский бобовый стебель и тупо задумывались об этом, - сказала она, - я бы оставила вас там, где вас поставила беда, только вернув ее корову вашей матери. Но вы проявили пытливый ум, большое мужество и предприимчивость, поэтому заслуживаете того, чтобы подняться; а когда вы взобрались на Бобовый стебель, вы поднялись по Лестнице удачи ».\n\nЗатем она попрощалась с Джеком и его матерью.",

        "en": "Murray Leinster.\nPipeline to Pluto.\nFAR, FAR OUT on Pluto, where the sun is only a very bright star and a frozen, airless globe circles in emptiness; far out on Pluto, there was motion.\nThe perpetual faint starlight was abruptly broken. Yellow lights shone suddenly in a circle, and men in spacesuits waddled to a space tug-absurdly marked Betsy-Anne in huge white letters.\nThey climbed up its side and went in the air lock.\nPresently a faint, jetting glow appeared below its drive tubes. It flared suddenly and the tug lifted, to hover expertly a brief distance above what seemed an unmarred field of frozen atmosphere.\nBut that field heaved and broke.\nThe nose of a Pipeline carrier appeared in the center of a cruciform opening. It thrust through.\nIt stood half its length above the surface of the dead and lifeless planet.\nThe tug drifted above it. Its grapnel dropped down, jetted minute flames, and engaged in the monster tow ring at the carrier's bow.\nThe tug's drive tubes flared luridly.\nThe carrier heaved abruptly up out of its hiding place and plunged for the heavens behind the tug.\nIt had a huge class mark and number painted on its side, which was barely visible as it whisked out of sight.\nIt went on up at four gravities acceleration, while the space tug lined out on the most precise of courses and drove fiercely for emptiness.\nA long, long time later, when Pluto was barely a pallid disk behind, the tug cast off. The carrier went on, sunward.\nIts ringed nose pointed unwaveringly to the sun, toward which it would drift for years.\nIt was one of a long, long line of carriers drifting through space, a day apart in time but millions of miles apart in distance.\nThey would go on until a tug from Earth came out and grappled them and towed them in to their actual home planet.\nBut the Betsy-Anne, of Pluto, did not pause for contemplation of the two-billion-mile-long line of ore carriers taking the metal of Pluto back to Earth.\nIt darted off from the line its late tow now followed.\nIts radio locator beam flickered invisibly in emptiness.\nPresently its course changed. It turned about. It braked violently, going up to six gravities deceleration for as long as half a minute at a time.\nPresently it came to rest and there floated toward it an object from Earth, a carrier with great white numerals on its sides.\nIt had been hauled off Earth and flung into an orbit which would fetch it out to Pluto.\nThe Betsy-Anne's grapnel floated toward it and jetted tiny sparks until the towring was engaged.\nThen the tug and its new tow from Earth started back to Pluto.\nThere were two long lines of white-numbered carriers floating sedately through space.\nOne line drifted tranquilly in to Earth.\nOne drifted no less tranquilly out past the orbits of six planets to reach the closed-in, underground colony of the mines on Pluto.\nTogether they made up the Pipeline.\nThe evening Moon-rocket took off over to the north and went straight up to the zenith.\nIts blue-white rocket-flare changed color as it fell behind, until the tail end was a deep, rich crimson.\nThe Pipeline docks were silent, now, but opposite the yard the row of flimsy eating and drinking-places rattled and thuttered to themselves from the lower-than-sound vibrations of the Moon-ship.\nThere was a youngish, battered man named Hill in the Pluto Bar, opposite the docks.\nHe paid no attention to the Moon-rocket, but he looked up sharply as a man came out of the Pipeline gate and came across the street toward the bar.\nBut Hill was staring at his drink when the door opened and the man from the dock looked the small dive over.\nBesides Hill-who looked definitely tough, and as if he had but recently recovered from a ravaging illness-there was only the bartender, a catawheel-truck driver and his girl having a drink together, and another man at a table by himself and fidgeting nervously as if he were waiting for someone.\nHill's eyes flickered again to the man in the door.\nHe looked suspicious. But then he looked back at his glass.\nThe other man came in and went to the bar.\n\"Evenin', Mr Crowder,\" said the bartender.\nHill's eyes darted up, and down again.\nThe bartender reached below the bar, filled a glass, and slid it across the mahogany.\n\"Evenin',\" said Crowder curtly. He looked deliberately at the fidgety man.\nHe seemed to note that the fidgety man was alone. He gave no sign of recognition, but his features pinched a little, as some men's do when they feel a little, crawling unease.\nBut there was nothing wrong except that the fidgety man seemed to be upset because he was waiting for someone who hadn't come.\nCrowder sat down in a booth, alone.\nHill waited a moment, looked sharply about him, and then stood up.\nHe crossed purposefully to the booth in which Crowder sat.\n\"I'm lookin' for a fella named Crowder,\" he said huskily.\n\"That's you, ain't it\"?\nCrowder looked at him, his face instantly mask like.\nHill's looks matched his voiced.\nThere was a scar under one eye. He had a cauliflower ear.\nHe looked battered, and hard-boiled-and as if he had just recovered from some serious injury or illness.\nHis skin was reddened in odd patches.\n\"My name is Crowder,\" said Crowder suspiciously.\n\"What is it\"?\nHill sat down opposite him.\n\"My name's Hill,\" he said in the same husky voice.\n\"There was a guy who was gonna come here tonight.\nHe'd fixed it up to be stowed away on a Pipeline carrier to Pluto.\nI bought 'im off. I bought his chance. I came here to take his place\".\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" said Crowder coldly.\nBut he did. Hill could see that he did. His stomach-muscles knotted.\nHe was uneasy. Hill's gaze grew scornful.\n\"You're the night super of the Pipeline yards, ain't you\"? he demanded truculently.\nCrowder's face stayed mask like.\nHill looked tough.\nHe looked like the sort of yegg who'd get into trouble with the police because he'd never think things out ahead.\nHe knew it and he didn't care.\nBecause he had gotten in trouble-often-because he didn't think things out ahead.\nBut he wasn't that way tonight.\nHe'd planned tonight in detail.\n\"Sure I'm the night superintendent of the Pipeline yards,\" said Crowder shortly.\n\"I came over for a drink.\nI'm going back.\nBut I don't know what you're talking about\".\nHill's eyes grew hard.\n\"Listen, fella,\" he said truculently-but he had been really ill, and the signs of it were plain-\"they're payin' five hundred credits a day in the mines out on Pluto, ain't they?\nA guy works a year out there, he comes back rich, don't he\"?\n\"Sure\"! said Crowder.\n\"The wages got set by law when it cost a lot to ship supplies out.\nBefore the Pipeline got going\".\n\"And they ain't got enough guys to work, have they\"?\n\"There's a shortage,\" agreed Crowder coldly.\n\"Everybody knows it.\nThe liners get fifty thousand credits for a one-way passage, and it takes six months for the trip\".\nHill nodded, truculently.\n\"I wanna get out to Pluto,\" he said huskily.\n\"See?\nThey don't ask too many questions about a guy when he turns up out there.\nBut the space liners, they do, and they want too many credits.\nSo I wanna go out in a carrier by Pipeline.\nSee\"?\nHill downed his drink and stood up.\n\"There's a law,\" Crowder said uncompromisingly, \"that says the Pipeline can't carry passengers or mails.\nThe space lines jammed that through.\nPolitics\".\n\"Maybe,\" said Hill pugnaciously, \"but you promised to let a guy stow away on the carrier tonight.\nHe told me about it.\nI paid him off. He sold me his place.\nI'm takin' it, see\"?\n\"I'm night superintendent at the yards,\" Crowder told him.\n\"If there are arrangements for stowaways, I don't know about them.\nYou're talking to the wrong man\".\nHe abruptly left the table. He walked across the room to the fidgety man, who seemed more and more uneasy because somebody hadn't turned up.\nCrowder's eyes were viciously angry when he bent over the fidgety man.\n\"Look here, Moore\"! he said savagely, in a low tone.\n\"That guy is on! He says he paid your passenger to let him take his place.\nThat's why your man hasn't showed up.\nYou picked him out and he sold his place to this guy.\nSo I'm leaving it right in your lap!\nI can lie myself clear.\nThey couldn't get any evidence back, anyhow.\nNot for years yet.\nBut what he told me is straight, he's got to go or he'll shoot off his mouth!\nSo it's in your lap\"!\nThe eyes of Moore-the fidgety man-had a hunted look in them.\nHe swallowed as if his mouth were dry. But he nodded.\nCrowder went out. Hill scowled after him.\nAfter a moment he came over to Moore.\n\"Lookahere,\" he said huskily.\n\"I wanna know something.\nThat guy's night super for Pipeline, ain't he\"?\nMoore nodded. He licked his lips.\n\"Lissen\"! said Hill angrily, \"there's a Pipeline carrier leaves here every day for Pluto, and one comes in from Pluto every day.\nIt's just like gettin' on a 'copter and goin' from one town to another on the Pipeline, ain't it\"?\nMoore nodded again-this time almost unnoticeably.\n\"That's what a guy told me,\" said Hill pugnaciously.\n\"He said he'd got it all fixed up to stow away on a carrier-load of grub.\nHe said he'd paid fifteen hundred credits to have it fixed up.\nHe was gonna leave tonight.\nI paid him off to let me take his place.\nNow this guy Crowder tells me I'm crazy\"!\n\"I   wouldn't know anything about it,\" said Moore, hesitantly.\n\"I know Crowder, but that's all\".\nHill growled to himself. He doubled up his fist and looked at it. It was a capable fist. There were scars on it as proof that things had been hit with it.\n\"OK\"! said Hill.\n\"I guess that guy kidded me.\nHe done me outta plenty credits.\nI know where to find him. He's goin' to a hospital\"!\nHe stirred, scowling.\n\"W-wait a minute,\" said Moore.\n\"It seems to me I heard something, once-\"\nCarriers drifted on through space.\nThey were motorless save for the tiny drives for the gyros in their noses.\nThey were a hundred feet long, and twenty feet thick, and some of them contained foodstuffs in air-sealed containers-because everything will freeze, in space, but even ice will evaporate in a vacuum.\nSome carried drums of rocket fuel for the tugs and heaters and the generators for the mines on Pluto.\nSome contained tools and books and visiphone records and caviar and explosives and glue and cosmetics for the women on Pluto.\nBut all of them drifted slowly, leisurely, unhurriedly, upon their two-billion-mile journey.\nThey were the Pipeline.\nYou put a carrier into the line at Earth, headed out to Pluto.\nThe same day you took a carrier out of space at the end of the line, at Pluto.\nYou put one into the Earth-bound line, on Pluto.\nYou took one out of space the same day, on Earth.\nThere was continuous traffic between the two planets, with daily arrivals and departures from each.\nBut passenger-traffic between Earth and Pluto went by space liners, at a fare of fifty thousand credits for the trip.\nBecause even the liners took six months for the journey, and the Pipeline carriers-well, there were over twelve hundred of them in each line going each way, a day apart in time and millions of miles apart in space.\nThey were very lonely, those long cylinders with their white-painted numbers on their sides.\nThe stars were the only eyes to look upon them while they traveled, and it took three years to drift from one end of the pipeline to the other.\nBut nevertheless there were daily arrivals and departures on the Pipeline, and there was continuous traffic between the two planets.\nMoore turned away from the pay-visiphone, into which he had talked in a confidential murmur while the screen remained blank.\nThe pugnacious, battered Hill scowled impatiently behind him.\n\"I'm not sure,\" said Moore uneasily.\n\"I talked to somebody I thought might know something, but they're cagey.\nThey'd lose their jobs and maybe get in worse trouble if anybody finds out they're smuggling stowaways to Pluto.\nY'see, the spacelines have a big pull in politics.\nThey've got it fixed so the Pipeline can't haul anything but freight.\nIf people could travel by Pipeline, the space liners could go broke.\nSo they watch close\".\nHe looked uneasy as he spoke. His eyes watched Hill almost alarmedly.\nBut Hill said sourly:\n\"OK!\nI'm gonna find that guy that sold me his place, and I'm gonna write a message on him with a blowtorch.\nThe docs'll have fun readin' him, and why he's in the hospital\"!\nMoore swallowed.\n\"Who was it?\nI've heard something-\"\nHill bit off the name.\nMoore swallowed again as if the name meant something.\nAs if it were right. \"I   I'll tell you, guy,\" said Moore.\n\"It's none of my business, but I   well   I might be able to fix things up for you.\nIt's risky, though, butting in on something that ain't my business\".\n\"How much\"? said Hill shortly.\n\"Oh   f-five hundred,\" said Moore uneasily.\nHill stared at him. Hard.\nThen he pulled a roll out of his pocket. He displayed it.\n\"I got credits,\" he said huskily.\n\"But I'm givin' you just one hundred of 'em.\nI'll give you nine hundred more when I'm all set.\nThat's twice what you asked for.\nBut that's all, see?\nI got a reason to get off Earth, and tonight, I'll pay to manage it.\nBut if I'm double-crossed, somebody gets hurt\"!\nMoore grinned nervously.\n\"No double-crossing in this,\" he said quickly.\n\"Just well   it is ticklish\".\n\"Yeah,\" said Hill. He waved a battered-knuckled hand.\n\"Get goin'.\nTell those guys I'm willin' to pay.\nBut I get stowed away, or I'll fix that guy who sold me his place so he'll tell all he knows!\nI'm goin' to Pluto, or else\"!\nMoore said cautiously:\n\"M-maybe you'll have to pay out a little more, but not much!\nBut you'll get there!\nI've heard   just heard, you understand   that the gang here smuggles a fella into the Pipeline yard and up into the nose of a carrier loaded with grub. Champagne and all that.\nHe can live high on the way, and not worry because out on Pluto they're so anxious to get a man to work that they'll square things.\nThey need men bad, out on Pluto!\nThey pay five hundred credits a day\"!\n\"Yeah,\" said Hill grimly.\n\"They need 'em so bad there ain't no extradition either. I'm int'rested in that, too. Now get goin' and fix me up\"!\nThe Pipeline was actually a two-billion-mile arrangement of specks in infinity.\nEach of the specks was a carrier. Each of the carriers was motorless and inert.\nEach was unlighted.\nEach was lifeless.\nBut-some of them had contained life when they started.\nThe last carrier out from Earth, to be sure, contained nothing but its proper cargo of novelties, rocket fuel, canned goods, and plastic base. But in the one beyond that, there was what had been a hopeful stowaway. A man, with his possessions neatly piled about him.\nHe'd been placed up in the nose of the carrier, and he'd waited, mousy-still, until the spacetug connected with the tow ring and heaved the carrier out to the beginning of the Pipeline.\nAs a stowaway, he hadn't wanted to be discovered.\nThe carrier ahead of that-many millions of miles farther out contained two girls, who had heard that stenographers were highly paid on Pluto, and that there were so few women that a girl might take her pick of husbands.\nThe one just before that had a man and woman in it.\nThere were four men in the carrier beyond them.\nThe hundred-foot cylinders drifting out and Out and out toward Pluto contained many stowaways.\nThe newest of them still looked quite human.\nThey looked quite tranquil.\nAfter all, when a carrier is hauled aloft at four gravities acceleration the air flows out of the bilgevalves very quickly, but the cold comes in more quickly still.\nNone of the stowaways had actually suffocated.\nThey'd frozen so suddenly they probably did not realize what was happening.\nAt sixty thousand feet the temperature is around seventy degrees below zero.\nAt a hundred and twenty thousand feet it's so cold that figures simply haven't any meaning.\nAnd at four gravities acceleration you reach a hundred and twenty thousand feet before you've really grasped the fact that you paid all your money to be flung unprotected into space.\nSo you never quite realize that you're going on out into a vacuum which will gradually draw every atom of moisture front every tissue of your body.\nBut, though there were many stowaways, not one had yet reached Pluto.\nThey would do so in time, of course.\nBut the practice of smuggling stowaways to Pluto had only been in operation for a year and a half.\nThe first of the deluded ones had not quite passed the halfway mark.\nSo the stowaway business should be safe and profitable for at least a year and a half more.\nThen it would be true that a passenger entered the Pipeline from Earth and a passenger reached Pluto on the same day.\nBut it would not be the same passenger, and there would be other differences.\nEven then, though, the racket would simply stop being profitable, because there was no extradition either to or from Pluto.\nSo the carriers drifting out through emptiness with, their stowaways were rather ironic, in a way.\nThere were tragedies within them, and nothing could be done about them.\nIt was ironic that the carriers gave no sign of the freight they bore.\nThey moved quite sedately, quite placidly, with a vast leisure among the stars.\nThe battered youngish man said coldly,\n\"Well?\nYou fixed it\"?\nMoore grinned nervously.\n\"Yeah.\nIt's all fixed.\nAt first they thought you might be an undercover man for the passenger lines, trying to catch the Pipeline smuggling passengers so they could get its charter canceled.\nBut they called up the man whose place you took, and it's straight.\nHe said he gave you his place and told you to see Crowder\".\nHill said angrily: \"But he stalled me\"!\nMoore licked his lips.\n\"You'll get the picture in a minute.\nWe cross the street and go in the Pipeline yard.\nYou have to slip the guard something.\nA hundred credits for looking the other way\".\nHill growled: \"No more stalling\"!\n\"No more stalling,\" promised Moore.\n\"You go out to Pluto in the next carrier\".\nThey went out of the Pluto Bar\nThey crossed the street, which was thin, black, churned-up mud from the catawheel trucks which hauled away each day's arrival of freight from Pluto.\nThey moved directly and openly for the gateway.\nThe guard strolled toward them.\n\"Slim,\" said Moore, grinning nervously, \"meet my friend Hill\".\n\"Sure\"! said the guard.\nHe extended his hand, palm up..\nHill put a hundred credit note in it.\n\"OK,\" said the guard.\n\"Luck on Pluto, fella\".\nHe turned his back.\nMoore snickered almost hysterically and led the way into the dark recesses of the yard.\nThere was the landing field for the space tugs.\nThere were six empty carriers off to one side.\nThere was one in a loading pit, sunk down on a hydraulic platform until only its nose now showed aboveground.\nIt could be loaded in its accelerating position, that way, and would not need to be upended after reaching maximum weight.\n\"Take-off is half an hour before sunrise today,\" said Moore jerkily.\n\"You'll know when it's coming because the hydraulic platform shoves the carrier up out of the pit.\nThen you'll hear the grapnel catching in the tow ring.\nThen you start.\nThe tug puts you in the Pipeline and hangs around and picks up the other carrier coming back\".\n\"That's speed\"! said Hill,\n\"Them scientists are great stuff, huh?\nI start off in that, and before I know it I'm on Pluto\"!\n\"Yeah,\" said Moore. He smirked with a twitching, ghastly effect.\n\"Before you know it.\nHere's the door where you go in\".\nCrowder came around the other side of the carrier's cone-shaped nose. He scowled at Hill, and Hill scowled back.\n\"You sounded phony to me,\" said Crowder ungraciously.\n\"I wasn't going to take any chances by admitting anything.\nMoore told you it's going to cost you extra\"?\n\"For what\"? demanded Hill, bristling.\n\"Because you've got to get away fast,\" said Crowder evenly.\n\"Because there's no extradition from Pluto.\nWe're not in this for our health.\nTwo thousand credits more\".\nHill snarled: \"Thief\" Then he said sullenly. \"OK\".\n\"And my nine hundred,\" said Moore eagerly.\n\"Sure,\" said Hill, sardonically. He paid.\n\"OK now?\nWhadda I do now\"?\n\"Go in the door here,\" said Crowder.\n\"The cargo's grub.\nGet comfortable and lay flat on your back when you feel the carrier coming up to be hitched on for towing After the acceleration's over and you're in the Pipeline, do as you please\"\n\"Yeah\"! said Moore, giggling nervously\n\"Do just as you please\"\nHill said tonelessly \"Right. I'll start now\".\nHe moved with a savage, infuriated swiftness.\nThere was a queer, muffled cracking sound.\nThen a startled gasp from Moore, a moment's struggle, and another sharp crack.\nHill went into the nose of the carrier. He dragged them in.\nHe stayed inside for minutes. He came out and listened, swinging a leather blackjack meditatively.\nThen he went over to the gate. He called cautiously to the guard:\n\"You! Slim!\nCrowder says come quick-and quiet!\nSomethin's happened and him and Moore got their hands full\".\nThe guard blinked, and then came quickly. Hill hurried behind him to the loading pit.\nAs the guard called tensely: \"Hey, Crowder, what's the matter\"?\nHill swung the blackjack again, with a certain deft precision.\nThe guard collapsed.\nA little later Hill had finished his work.\nThe three men were bound with infinite, science.\nThey not only could not escape, they could not even kick.\nThat's quite a trick-but it can be done if you study the art.\nAnd they were not only gagged, but there was tape over their mouths beyond the gag, so that they could not even make a respectable groaning noise.\nAnd Hill surveyed the three of them by the light of a candle he had taken from his pocket-as he had taken the rope from about his waist-and said in husky satisfaction:\n\"OK\nOK!\nI'm givin' you fellas some bad news.\nYou're headin' out to Pluto\".\nTerror-close to madness shone in the three pairs of eyes which fixed frantically upon him.\nThe eyes seemed to threaten to start from their sockets.\n\"It ain't so bad,\" said Hill grimly.\n\"Not like you think it is.\nYou'll get there before you know it.\nNo kidding!\nYou'll go snakin'up at four gravities, and the air'll go out.\nBut you won't die of that.\nBefore you strangle, you'll freeze-and fast!\nYou'll freeze so fast y'won't have time to die, fellas.\nThat's the funny part.\nYou freeze so quick you ain't got time to die!\nThe Space Patrol found out a year or so back that that can happen, when things are just right-and they will be, for you.\nSo the Space Patrol will be all set to bring you back, when y'get to Pluto.\nBut it does hurt, fellas.\nIt hurts like' hell!\nI oughta know\"!\nHe grinned at them, his mouth twisted and his eyes grim.\n\"I paid you fellas to send me out to Pluto last year.\nBut it happened I didn't get to Pluto.\nThe Patrol dragged my carrier out o' the Pipeline and over to Callisto because they hadda shortage o' rocket fuel there.\nSo I' been through it, and it hurts.!\nI wouldn't tell on you fellas, because I wanted you to have it, so I took my bawlin' out for stowin' away and come back to send you along.\nSo you' goin', fellas! And you' goin' all the way to Pluto!\nAnd remember this, fellas! It's gonna be good!\nAfter they bring you back, Out there on Pluto, every fella and every soul you sent off as stowaways, they'll be there on Pluto waitin' for you.\nIt's gonna be good, guys!\nIt's gonna be good\"!\nHe looked at them in the candlelight, and seemed to take a vast satisfaction in their expressions.\nThen he blew out the candle, and closed the nose door of the carrier, and went away.\nAnd half an hour before sunrise next morning the hydraulic platform pushed the carrier up, and a space tug hung expertly overhead and its grapnel came down and hooked in the tow ring, and then the carrier jerked skyward at four gravities acceleration.\nFar out from Earth, the carrier went on, the latest of a long line of specks in infinity which constituted the Pipeline to Pluto.\nMany of those specks contained things which had been human and would be human again.\nBut now each one drifted sedately away from the sun, and in the later carriers the stowaways still looked completely human and utterly tranquil.\nWhat had happened to them had come so quickly that they did not realize what it was.\nBut in the last carrier of all, with three bound, gagged figures 'in its nose, the expressions were not tranquil at all.\nBecause those men did know what had happened to them.\nMore they knew what was yet to come.",
        "ru": "Мюррей Ленстер.\nТрубопровод к Плутону.\nДАЛЕКО, ДАЛЕКО на Плутоне, где Солнце - всего лишь очень яркая звезда, а замерзший, безвоздушный шар кружится в пустоте; далеко на Плутоне было движение.\nВечный тусклый свет звезд внезапно исчез. Желтые огни внезапно засияли по кругу, и люди в скафандрах переваливались к космическому буксиру с нелепой надписью «Бетси-Энн» огромными белыми буквами.\nОни взобрались на его борт и вошли в шлюз.\nВскоре под его приводными трубами появилось слабое струящееся свечение. Он внезапно вспыхнул, и буксир поднялся, умело парив на коротком расстоянии над тем, что казалось неизведанным полем замороженной атмосферы.\nНо это поле вздыбилось и сломалось.\nВ центре крестообразного проема появилась носовая часть конвейера. Он проткнулся.\nОн стоял на половину своей длины над поверхностью мертвой и безжизненной планеты.\nБуксир плыл над ним. Его хватка упала, извергнув мельчайшие огоньки, и зацепилась за буксирное кольцо чудовища на носу авианосца.\nПриводные трубы буксира мрачно вспыхнули.\nАвианосец резко выскочил из укрытия и устремился в небеса за буксиром.\nНа его стороне был написан огромный знак класса и номер, который был едва заметен, когда он исчез из поля зрения.\nОн продолжал расти с ускорением в четыре силы тяжести, в то время как космический буксир выстроился по наиболее точному курсу и яростно устремился в пустоту.\nСпустя долгое время, когда Плутон был едва ли не тусклым диском позади, буксир оторвался. Авианосец двинулся вперед, к солнцу.\nЕго окаймленный нос непоколебимо указывал на солнце, к которому он летел годами.\nЭто был один из длинной, длинной вереницы авианосцев, дрейфующих в космосе, с разницей в день во времени, но на расстоянии в миллионы миль.\nОни будут идти до тех пор, пока с Земли не выйдет буксир, который схватит их и не отбуксирует на их настоящую родную планету.\nНо Бетси-Энн с Плутона не стала размышлять о линии носителей руды протяженностью в два миллиарда миль, доставляющих металл Плутона на Землю.\nОн оторвался от троса, за которым следовал его поздний буксир.\nЛуч радиолокатора незаметно мерцал в пустоте.\nВ настоящее время его курс изменился. Оказалось. Он резко затормозил, замедляясь до шести гравитаций по полминуты за раз.\nВскоре он остановился, и к нему плыл объект с Земли, носитель с большими белыми цифрами по бокам.\nЕго вытащили с Земли и вывели на орбиту, которая должна была привести к Плутону.\nГрейфер «Бетси-Энн» подплыл к нему и испускал крошечные искры, пока буксирный крюк не сработал.\nЗатем буксир и его новый буксир с Земли отправились обратно к Плутону.\nДве длинные очереди авианосцев с белыми номерами чинно плыли в космосе.\nОдна линия спокойно дрейфовала на Землю.\nОдин не менее спокойно дрейфовал мимо орбит шести планет и достиг закрытой подземной колонии шахт на Плутоне.\nВместе они составили Трубопровод.\nВечерняя луна-ракета взлетела на север и пошла прямо в зенит.\nЕго бело-голубая ракетная ракета меняла цвет по мере того, как она отставала, пока хвостовая часть не стала темно-красной.\nДоки Трубопровода теперь были безмолвными, но напротив двора ряд хлипких мест для еды и питья грохотали и трещали сами по себе из-за более слабых, чем звук, колебаний лунного корабля.\nВ баре «Плутон» напротив пристани был молодой, избитый мужчина по имени Хилл.\nОн не обратил внимания на лунную ракету, но резко поднял глаза, когда из ворот Трубопровода вышел человек и перешел улицу к бару.\nНо Хилл смотрел на свой стакан, когда дверь открылась, и человек с пристани осмотрел маленькое ныряние.\nПомимо Хилла, который выглядел определенно крутым и как будто недавно выздоровел от ужасной болезни, были только бармен, водитель грузовика с катавером и его девушка, которые вместе выпивали, а еще один мужчина сидел за столиком и ерзал нервно, как будто кого-то ждал.\nГлаза Хилла снова метнулись к человеку в двери.\nОн выглядел подозрительно. Но затем он снова посмотрел на свой стакан.\nДругой мужчина вошел и подошел к бару.\n«Даже, мистер Краудер, - сказал бармен.\nГлаза Хилла метнулись вверх и снова вниз.\nБармен протянул руку под стойкой, наполнил стакан и поставил его по красному дереву.\n- Даже, - отрывисто сказал Краудер. Он намеренно посмотрел на суетливого мужчину.\nОн, казалось, заметил, что этот беспокойный мужчина был один. Он не подал виду, что узнал, но его черты лица слегка сжались, как это делают некоторые мужчины, когда чувствуют легкое, ползучее беспокойство.\nНо в этом не было ничего плохого, за исключением того, что беспокойный мужчина выглядел расстроенным, потому что ждал кого-то, кто не пришел.\nКраудер сел в будку в одиночестве.\nХилл подождал секунду, внимательно огляделся по сторонам, а затем встал.\nОн целенаправленно подошел к кабинке, в которой сидел Краудер.\n«Я ищу парня по имени Краудер», - хрипло сказал он.\n\"Это ты, не так ли\"?\nКраудер посмотрел на него, его лицо мгновенно замаскировалось.\nВзгляд Хилла соответствовал его голосу.\nПод одним глазом был шрам. У него было ухо из цветной капусты.\nОн выглядел измученным и закаленным - как будто только что оправился от серьезной травмы или болезни.\nЕго кожа покраснела странными участками.\n«Меня зовут Краудер», - подозрительно сказал Краудер.\n\"Что это такое\"?\nХилл сел напротив него.\n«Меня зовут Хилл», - сказал он тем же хриплым голосом.\n«Был парень, который собирался приехать сюда сегодня вечером.\nОн приготовил его, чтобы уложить на Транспортере к Плутону.\nЯ купил его. Я купил его шанс. Я пришел сюда, чтобы занять его место».\n«Я не понимаю, о чем вы говорите, - холодно сказал Краудер.\nНо он это сделал. Хилл видел, что он это сделал. Его мышцы живота сжались.\nЕму было не по себе. Взгляд Хилла стал насмешливым.\n«Ты - ночной супервайзер Трубопроводных дворов, не так ли»? - резко потребовал он.\nЛицо Краудера оставалось маской.\nХилл выглядел крутым.\nОн выглядел как болван, у которого возникнут проблемы с полицией, потому что он никогда не будет думать заранее.\nОн знал это, и ему было все равно.\nПотому что он попадал в неприятности - часто - потому что не думал заранее.\nНо сегодня он был не таким.\nОн подробно спланировал этот вечер.\n«Конечно, я ночной суперинтендант Трубопроводных дворов», - коротко сказал Краудер.\n«Я пришел выпить.\nЯ возвращаюсь.\nНо я не понимаю, о чем вы говорите».\nГлаза Хилла стали жесткими.\n«Слушай, Fella,» сказал он truculently, но он был очень болен, и признаки этого были plain- \"они заплатите компенсацию пятьсот кредитов в день в шахтах , выполненной на Плутоне, не так ли?\nМужик работает год там, он возвращается богатым, не так ли \"?\n\"Конечно\"! - сказал Краудер.\n«Заработная плата была установлена ​​законом, когда доставка грузов обходилась очень дорого.\nДо того, как трубопровод заработал».\n«И у них не хватает парней для работы, не так ли»?\n«Есть нехватка», - холодно согласился Краудер.\n«Это знают все.\nЛайнеры получают пятьдесят тысяч кредитов за проезд в один конец, а поездка занимает полгода».\nХилл яростно кивнул.\n\"Я хочу попасть на Плутон\" - хрипло сказал он.\n\"Увидеть?\nОни не задают слишком много вопросов о парне, когда он появляется.\nНо космические лайнеры у них есть, и им нужно слишком много кредитов.\nИтак, я хочу поехать на авианосце Pipeline.\nВидите?\nХилл допил бокал и встал.\n«Есть закон, - бескомпромиссно сказал Краудер, - который гласит, что трубопровод не может перевозить пассажиров или почту.\nПробелы пробили это насквозь.\nПолитика ».\n« Может быть, - язвительно сказал Хилл, - но ты обещал позволить парню укрыться на авианосце сегодня вечером ».\nОн мне об этом рассказал.\nЯ расплатился с ним. Он продал мне свое место.\nЯ беру его, понимаете?\n«Я ночной суперинтендант двора, - сказал ему Краудер\n».\nВы говорите с неправильным человеком».\nОн внезапно покинул стол. Он прошел через комнату к суетливый человек, который , казалось , все более и более неловко , потому что кто - то не появился.\nГлаза Crowder были жестоко сердится , когда он наклонился над суетливый человек.\n«Посмотри сюда, Мур!» - резко сказал он низким тоном.\n«Этот парень идет! Он говорит, что заплатил вашему пассажиру, чтобы он занял свое место.\nВот почему ваш мужчина не появился.\nВы выбрали его, и он продал свое место этому парню.\nТак что я оставляю это прямо вам на коленях!\nЯ могу солгать.\nВо всяком случае, они не могли получить назад никаких доказательств.\nЕще нет.\nНо то, что он мне сказал, прямо, ему нужно идти, иначе он отстрелит себе рот!\n\nВ глазах Мура - суетливого человека - была охота.\nОн сглотнул, как будто во рту пересохло. Но он кивнул.\nКраудер вышел. Хилл нахмурился ему вслед.\nЧерез мгновение он подошел к Муру.\n«Смотри сюда», - хрипло сказал он.\n«Я хочу кое-что узнать.\nНочь этого парня супер для Pipeline, не так ли»?\nМур кивнул. Он облизнул губы.\n\"Лиссен\"! - сердито сказал Хилл. - Отсюда каждый день отправляется авианосец к Плутону, а один приходит с Плутона каждый день.\nЭто как сесть на вертолет и лететь из одного города в другой по трубопроводу, не так ли? \"?\nМур снова кивнул - на этот раз почти незаметно.\n\"Вот что мне сказал парень\"\n«Он сказал, что у него все подготовлено, чтобы уложить на грузовике с харчом.\nОн сказал, что заплатил полторы тысячи кредитов, чтобы починить его.\nОн собирался уехать сегодня вечером.\nЯ заплатил ему, чтобы он позволил мне займи его место.\nТеперь этот парень Краудер говорит мне, что я сумасшедший \"!\n«Я бы ничего об этом не знал», - нерешительно сказал Мур.\n«Я знаю Краудера, но это все».\nХилл зарычал про себя. Он сжал кулак и посмотрел на него. Это был умелый кулак. На нем были шрамы, свидетельствующие о том, что что-то им попало.\n\"ОК\".! - сказал Хилл.\n«Думаю, этот парень меня подшутил.\nОн сделал мне много кредитов.\nЯ знаю, где его найти. Он идет в больницу»!\nОн зашевелился, хмурый.\n\"П-погоди,\" сказал Мур.\n«Мне кажется, однажды я что-то слышал…»\nНосители плыли по космосу.\nОни были безмоторными, за исключением крошечных приводов гироскопов в носу.\nОни были сто футов в длину и двадцать футов в толщину, и некоторые из них содержали продукты в герметичных контейнерах - потому что в космосе все замерзнет, ​​но даже лед испарится в вакууме.\nНекоторые несли бочки с ракетным топливом для буксиров и обогревателей, а также генераторы для шахт на Плутоне.\nВ некоторых были инструменты, книги, записи визифонов, икра, взрывчатка, клей и косметика для женщин на Плутоне.\nНо все они плыли медленно, неторопливо, неторопливо на своем двухмиллиардном пути.\nОни были трубопроводом.\nВы запускаете авианосец на Землю, направляясь к Плутону.\nВ тот же день вы вывели авианосец из космоса в конце линии на Плутоне.\nВы помещаете один в линию, привязанную к Земле, на Плутоне.\nВы взяли один из космоса в тот же день на Земле.\nМежду двумя планетами было непрерывное движение, с ежедневным прибытием и отправлением с каждой.\nНо пассажирские перевозки между Землей и Плутоном осуществлялись на космических лайнерах по цене в пятьдесят тысяч кредитов.\nПотому что даже лайнерам потребовалось шесть месяцев на путешествие, а трубопроводным перевозчикам - ну, их было более двенадцати сотен на каждой линии, идущей в каждую сторону, с разницей в день во времени и миллионы миль в космосе.\nИм было очень одиноко, эти длинные цилиндры с выкрашенными в белый цвет цифрами по бокам.\nЗвезды были единственными глазами, которые смотрели на них, пока они путешествовали, и потребовалось три года, чтобы дрейфовать от одного конца трубопровода к другому.\nНо, тем не менее, по Трубопроводу ежедневно приходили и уходили, и между двумя планетами было непрерывное движение.\nМур отвернулся от платного визифона, в который он разговаривал конфиденциальным шепотом, пока экран оставался пустым.\nДрачливый, потрепанный Хилл нетерпеливо хмурился позади него.\n«Я не уверен», - с тревогой сказал Мур.\n\"Я разговаривал с кем-то, что, как мне казалось, может что-то знать, но они уклончивы.\nОни потеряют работу и, возможно, попадут в более серьезные неприятности, если кто-нибудь узнает, что они переправляют безбилетных пассажиров на Плутон.\nВидите ли, космические линии имеют большое значение в политике.\nОни починили его, поэтому по трубопроводу нельзя перевозить ничего, кроме грузов.\nЕсли бы люди могли путешествовать по трубопроводу, космические лайнеры могли разориться.\nТак что они смотрят внимательно \".\nОн выглядел обеспокоенным, когда говорил. Его глаза смотрели на Хилла почти с тревогой.\nНо Хилл кисло сказал:\n\" Хорошо!\nЯ найду того парня, который продал мне свое жилище, и напишу ему записку с паяльной лампой.\nДокторам будет весело читать его, и почему он в больнице \"!\nМур сглотнул.\n\" Кто это был?\nЯ кое-что слышал ... \"\n\nМур снова сглотнул, как будто это имя что-то значило.\nКак будто это было правильно. «Я скажу тебе, парень, - сказал Мур.\n«Это не мое дело, но я могу\nкое-что исправить для вас. Однако это рискованно - вмешиваться в то, что не мое дело».\n\"Сколько\"? - коротко сказал Хилл.\n«Ой, пятьсот», - тревожно сказал Мур.\nХилл уставился на него. Жесткий.\nЗатем он вытащил из кармана сверток. Он показал это.\n«Я получил кредиты», - хрипло сказал он.\n«Но я даю тебе только сотню.\nЯ дам тебе еще девятьсот, когда все будет готово.\nЭто вдвое больше, чем ты просил.\nНо это все, увидеть?\nУ меня есть причина покинуть Землю, и сегодня я заплачу, чтобы справиться с ней.\nНо если меня обманут, кто-нибудь пострадает! »\nМур нервно ухмыльнулся.\n« Никакого обмана », - быстро сказал он.\n« Ну, это щекотно ».\n— Угу, — промычал Хилл. Он помахал испещренной шрамами рукой.\nИди уже.\nСкажи этим парням, что я буду платить.\nНо меня укроют, или я починю того парня, который продал мне свое жилище, чтобы он рассказал все, что знает!\nЯ иду к Плутону, иначе \"!\nМур осторожно сказал:\n\" М-может, вам придется заплатить немного больше, но не намного!\nНо вы туда доберетесь!\nЯ слышал, только что слышал, вы понимаете, что здесь банда протаскивает парня на территорию Трубопровода и в нос перевозчика, груженного хищником. шампанское и все такое.\nОн может жить высоко в пути, и не беспокоиться, потому что на Плутоне они так хотят заставить человека работать, что все уладят.\nИм очень нужны люди, на Плутоне!\nОни платят пятьсот кредитов в день »!\n« Ага, - мрачно сказал Хилл.\n- Они им так нужны, что экстрадиции тоже нет. Меня это тоже интересует. Теперь получить идем и исправить меня \"!\nТрубопроводная была на самом деле договоренность два миллиарда миль крапин в бесконечности.\nКаждый из пятнышек был носителем. Каждый из носителей был безмоторным и инертны.\nКаждый из них был неосвещенным.\nКаждый из них были безжизненным .\nНо, некоторые из них содержали жизнь , когда они начали.\nРазумеется, последний отправившийся с Земли авианосец не содержал ничего, кроме собственно груза новинок, ракетного топлива, консервов и пластиковой основы. Но в том, что было дальше, было то, что было безбилетным проездом. Мужчина с аккуратно сложенным вокруг него имуществом.\nЕго поместили в носовую часть авианосца, и он, не двигаясь, ждал, пока космический буксир соединился с буксирным кольцом и не поднял авианосец к началу Трубопровода.\nКак безбилетный пассажир, он не хотел, чтобы его обнаружили.\nАвианосец впереди этого - на многие миллионы миль дальше - содержал двух девочек, которые слышали, что стенографисткам на Плутоне очень хорошо платят и что женщин так мало, что девушка может выбрать себе мужей.\nВ том, что прямо перед этим, были мужчина и женщина.\nЗа ними в экипаже было четверо мужчин.\nСтотфутовые цилиндры, дрейфующие к Плутону, содержали много безбилетных пассажиров.\nСамый новый из них все еще выглядел вполне человечным.\nОни выглядели довольно спокойными.\nВ конце концов, когда авианосец поднимается ввысь с четырехкратным ускорением свободного падения, воздух выходит из трюмных клапанов очень быстро, но холод проникает еще быстрее.\nНа самом деле никто из безбилетных пассажиров не задохнулся.\nОни замерзли так внезапно, что, вероятно, даже не осознали, что происходит.\nНа высоте шестьдесят тысяч футов температура составляет около семидесяти градусов ниже нуля.\nНа высоте ста двадцати тысяч футов так холодно, что цифры просто не имеют значения.\nИ при ускорении в четыре силы тяжести вы достигаете ста двадцати тысяч футов, прежде чем действительно осознаете тот факт, что вы заплатили все свои деньги, чтобы вас бросили в космос без защиты.\nТаким образом, вы никогда до конца не осознаёте, что попадаете в вакуум, который будет постепенно вытягивать каждый атом влаги из каждой ткани вашего тела.\nНо, хотя было много безбилетных пассажиров, ни один из них еще не достиг Плутона.\nКонечно, со временем они сделают это.\nНо практика переправки безбилетных пассажиров на Плутон действовала всего полтора года.\nПервый из заблудших еще не прошел половину пути.\nТак что безбилетный бизнес должен быть безопасным и прибыльным как минимум еще полтора года.\nТогда было бы правдой, что пассажир вошел в трубопровод с Земли, а пассажир достиг Плутона в один и тот же день.\nНо это был бы не тот же пассажир, и были бы другие отличия.\nНо даже тогда рэкет просто перестанет приносить прибыль, потому что не было никакой экстрадиции ни на Плутон, ни с него.\nТак что авианосцы, дрейфующие в пустоте вместе с их безбилетными пассажирами, в некотором роде были довольно ироничны.\nВ них были трагедии, и с ними ничего нельзя было поделать.\nПарадоксально, что перевозчики не подавали признаков груза, который они несли.\nОни двигались довольно степенно, спокойно, с огромным отдыхом среди звезд.\nИзмученный молодой человек холодно сказал:\n«Ну?\nТы починил»?\nМур нервно ухмыльнулся.\n«Да.\nВсе починено.\nСначала они подумали, что вы можете быть тайным человеком на пассажирских линиях, пытаясь поймать пассажиров, перевозящих контрабанду по трубопроводу, чтобы они могли отменить его чартер.\nНо они позвонили человеку, место которого вы заняли, и это прямо.\nОн сказал, что уступил вам свое место и сказал, чтобы вы видели Краудера \".\nХилл сердито сказал: «Но он остановил меня»!\nМур облизнул губы.\n«Снимок получишь через минуту.\nПереходим улицу и идем во двор Трубопровода.\nНадо что-то подсовывать охраннику.\nСотня кредитов за то, чтобы посмотреть в другую сторону».\nХилл зарычал: «Больше не глотать»!\n«Больше никаких задержек», - пообещал Мур.\n\"\nОни вышли из бара «Плутон».\nОни перешли улицу, которая была тонкой, черной, взбитой грязью от грузовиков с катаверными колесами, которые увозили каждый день прибывающие с Плутона грузы.\nОни двинулись прямо и открыто к воротам.\nК ним подошел охранник.\n«Слим, - сказал Мур, нервно ухмыляясь, - познакомься с моим другом Хиллом».\n\"Конечно\"! сказал охранник.\nОн протянул руку ладонью вверх ...\nХилл вложил в нее сотню кредитных карт.\n«Хорошо, - сказал охранник.\n«Удачи на Плутоне, приятель».\nОн повернулся спиной.\nМур почти истерически хмыкнул и направился в темные уголки двора.\nТам была площадка для приземления буксиров.\n\nОдин был в погрузочной яме, опущенный на гидравлическую платформу, так что теперь над землей выступал только его нос.\nТаким образом, его можно было нагружать в положении разгона, и его не нужно было переворачивать после достижения максимального веса.\n«Взлет за полчаса до восхода солнца сегодня», - отрывисто сказал Мур.\n«Вы узнаете, когда он приближается, потому что гидравлическая платформа выталкивает носитель из ямы.\nЗатем вы услышите, как крюк цепляется за буксирное кольцо.\nЗатем вы начинаете.\nБуксир помещает вас в трубопровод, зависает и выбирает до возвращения другого перевозчика \".\n«Это скорость»! - сказал Хилл:\n«Эти ученые - отличные люди, да?\nЯ начинаю с этого, и, прежде чем я это осознаю, я уже на Плутоне»!\n«Да, - сказал Мур. Он ухмыльнулся, дергаясь, ужасно.\n«Прежде чем вы это узнаете.\nВот дверь, через которую вы входите».\nКраудер обошел конусообразный нос авианосца с другой стороны. Он сердито посмотрел на Хилла, и Хилл нахмурился в ответ.\n«Ты показался мне фальшивым», - нелюбезно сказал Краудер.\n«Я не собирался рисковать, признаваясь в чем-либо.\nМур сказал вам, что это будет вам дорого стоить»?\n\"Для чего\"? потребовал Хилл, ощетинившись.\n«Потому что тебе нужно быстро уйти», - спокойно сказал Краудер.\n«Потому что с Плутона экстрадиции нет.\nМы занимаемся этим не ради нашего здоровья.\nЕще две тысячи кредитов».\nХилл прорычал: \"Вор\". Потом угрюмо сказал он. \"ОК\".\n«И мои девятьсот, - нетерпеливо сказал Мур.\n«Конечно», - сардонически сказал Хилл. Он заплатил.\n«Хорошо, теперь?\nЧто я делаю сейчас?»\n«Войдите в дверь здесь», - сказал Краудер.\n«В грузе жвачка.\nУстройтесь поудобнее и лягте на спину, когда почувствуете, что авианосец приближается к буксировке. После того, как ускорение закончится и вы окажетесь в трубопроводе, делайте, что хотите\n» - сказал Мур, нервно хихикая.\n«Делай, как хочешь», -\nсказал Хилл бесцветным тоном: «Хорошо. Я начну сейчас».\nОн двигался с дикой, разъяренной быстротой.\nРаздался странный приглушенный треск.\nЗатем испуганный вздох Мура, мгновенная борьба и еще один резкий треск.\nХилл попал в нос авианосца.\nОн оставался внутри несколько минут. Он вышел и прислушался, задумчиво размахивая кожаным блэкджеком.\nЗатем он подошел к воротам. Он осторожно крикнул охраннику:\n«Ты! Тонкий!\nКраудер говорит, приходи быстро и тише!\nЧто-то случилось, и он и Мур были заняты».\nОхранник моргнул, а затем быстро подошел. Хилл поспешил за ним к погрузочной яме.\nКак охранник напряженно крикнул: «Эй, Краудер, в чем дело»?\nХилл снова взмахнул блэкджеком с некоторой ловкостью.\nОхранник упал.\nЧуть позже Хилл закончил свою работу.\nТрое мужчин были связаны бесконечной наукой.\nОни не только не могли убежать, они даже не могли ударить ногой.\nЭто довольно уловка, но ее можно сделать, если вы изучите искусство.\nИ им не только заткнули кляпом, но и заклеили им рот изолентой за кляпом, так что они не могли даже издать приличный стон.\nИ Хилл осмотрел всех троих при свете свечи, которую вытащил из кармана - поскольку он снял веревку с пояса - и сказал хриплым удовлетворением:\n«Ладно,\nладно!\nЯ даю вам, ребята, немного. Плохие новости.\nВы направляетесь к Плутону \".\nУжас, близкий к безумию, светился в трех парах глаз, лихорадочно смотрящих на него.\nКазалось, что глаза вырвутся из орбит.\n«Это не так уж плохо, - мрачно сказал Хилл.\n«Не так, как ты думаешь.\nТы»\nБез шуток!\nВы подплывете с четырьмя гравитациями, и воздух погаснет.\nНо ты не умрешь от этого.\nПрежде чем задушить, замерзнешь - и быстро!\nВы так быстро замерзнете, что не успеете умереть, ребята.\nЭто самое забавное.\nВы так быстро замерзаете, что у вас нет времени умирать!\nПримерно год назад космический патруль обнаружил, что это может произойти, когда все будет хорошо, и так оно и будет для вас.\nТак что космический патруль будет готов вернуть вас, когда вы доберетесь до Плутона.\nНо это больно, ребята.\nБольно как черт!\nЯ должен знать \"!\nОн ухмыльнулся им, его рот скривился, а глаза мрачны.\n\" Я заплатил вам, ребята, чтобы они отправили меня на Плутон в прошлом году.\nНо случилось так, что я не попал на Плутон.\nПатруль вытащил мой авианосец из Трубопровода в Каллисто, потому что там не хватало ракетного топлива.\nТак что я прошел через это, и это больно!\nЯ бы не стал рассказывать о вас, ребята, потому что хотел, чтобы это было у вас, поэтому я взял свой крик на кладбище и вернулся, чтобы отправить вас с собой.\nИтак, вы идете, ребята! И ты идешь до Плутона!\nИ запомните это, ребята! Все будет хорошо!\nПосле того, как они вернут вас, Там, на Плутоне, каждый парень и каждая душа, которую вы отправили в качестве безбилетных пассажиров, они будут там, на Плутоне, ждать вас.\nВсе будет хорошо, ребята!\nБудет хорошо \"!\nХилл смотрел на пленников, явно получая удовольствие от выражения их лиц.\nЗатем он задул свечу, закрыл носовую дверцу переноски и ушел.\nИ на следующее утро за полчаса до восхода солнца гидравлическая платформа подтолкнула авианосец, и космический буксир мастерски повис над головой, его крюк опустился и зацепился за буксирное кольцо, а затем носитель дернулся в небо с ускорением в четыре силы тяжести.\nВдали от Земли летел авианосец, последний из длинной череды бесконечных пятнышек, составляющих Трубопровод к Плутону.\nМногие из этих пятнышек содержали вещи, которые были человеческими и снова станут людьми.\nНо теперь каждый из них степенно удалялся от солнца, и в более поздних авианосцах безбилетные пассажиры по-прежнему выглядели вполне человеческими и совершенно спокойными.\nТо, что случилось с ними, произошло так быстро, что они не осознавали, что это было.\nНо у последнего из всех носильщиков, с тремя связанными фигурами с кляпом во рту в носу, выражение лица было отнюдь не спокойным.\nПотому что эти люди знали, что с ними случилось.\nБольше они знали, что еще впереди.",
